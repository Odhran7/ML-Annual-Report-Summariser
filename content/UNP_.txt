railroad security – our security efforts consist of a wide variety of measures including employee training engagement with our customers training of emergency responders and partnerships with numerous federal state and local government agencies while federal law requires us to protect the confidentiality of our security plans designed to safeguard against terrorism and other security incidents the following provides a general overview of our security initiatives

 

uprr security measures – we maintain a comprehensive security plan designed to both deter and respond to any potential or actual threats as they arise the plan includes four levels of alert status each with its own set of countermeasures we employ our own police force consisting of commissioned and highlytrained officers the police are certified state law enforcement officers with investigative and arrest powers the union pacific police department has achieved accreditation under the commission on accreditation for law enforcement agencies inc calea for complying with the highest law enforcement standards our employees undergo recurrent security and preparedness training as well as federally mandated hazardous materials and security training we regularly review the sufficiency of our employee training programs we maintain the capability to move critical operations to backup facilities in different locations

 

we operate an emergency response management center 24 hours a day the center receives reports of emergencies dangerous or potentially dangerous conditions and other safety and security issues from our employees the public law enforcement and other government officials in cooperation with government officials we monitor both threats and public events and as necessary we may alter rail traffic flow at times of concern to minimize risk to communities and our operations we comply with the hazardous materials routing rules and other requirements imposed by federal law we design our operating plan to expedite the movement of hazardous material shipments to minimize the time rail cars remain idle at yards and terminals located in or near major population centers additionally in compliance with transportation security agency regulations we deployed information systems and instructed employees in tracking and documenting the handoff of rail security sensitive materials with customers and interchange partners

 

we established a number of our own innovative safety and securityoriented initiatives ranging from various investments in technology to the officer on train program which provides local law enforcement officers with the opportunity to ride with train crews to enhance their understanding of railroad operations and risks our staff of information security professionals continually assess cybersecurity risks and implement mitigation programs that evolve with the changing technology threat environment for example we released critical patches to address the vulnerability in log4j a component widely used in our applications and found in commercial software to date we have not experienced any material disruption of our operations due to a cyber threat or attack directed at us

 

cooperation with federal state and local government agencies – we work closely on physical and cybersecurity initiatives with government agencies including the us department of transportation dot the department of homeland security dhs along with its cybersecurity  infrastructure security agency cisa and transportation security administration tsa as well as local police departments fire departments and other first responders in connection with new guidance from the tsa effective january 1 2022 we are required to report cyber incidents to cisa perform a cyber vulnerability selfassessment and submit results to the tsa by march 31 2022 assemble and adopt a cyber incident response plan by june 29 2022 and appoint cybersecurity coordinators in conjunction with the association of american railroads aar we sponsor ask rail a mobile application that provides first responders with secure links to electronic information including commodity and emergency response information required by emergency personnel to respond to accidents and other situations we also participate in the national joint terrorism task force a multiagency effort established by the us department of justice and the federal bureau of investigation to combat and prevent terrorism

strategic and operational risks 

 

we must manage fluctuating demand for our services and network capacity – significant reductions in demand for rail services with respect to one or more commodities or changes in consumer preferences that affect the businesses of our customers can lead to increased costs associated with resizing our operations including higher unit operating costs and costs for the storage of locomotives rail cars and other equipment workforce adjustments and other related activities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity if there is significant demand for our services that exceeds the designed capacity of our network we may experience network difficulties including congestion and reduced velocity that could compromise the level of service we provide to our customers this level of demand may also compound the impact of weather and weatherrelated events on our operations and velocity although we continue to improve our transportation plan add capacity improve operations at our yards and other facilities and improve our ability to address surges in demand for any reason with adequate resources we cannot be sure that these measures will fully or adequately address any service shortcomings resulting from demand exceeding our planned capacity we may experience other operational or service difficulties related to network capacity dramatic and unplanned fluctuations in our customers’ demand for rail service with respect to one or more commodities or operating regions or other events that could negatively impact our operational efficiency which could all have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

 

we transport hazardous materials – we transport certain hazardous materials and other materials including crude oil ethanol and toxic inhalation hazard tih materials such as chlorine that pose certain risks in the event of a release or combustion additionally us laws impose common carrier obligations on railroads that require us to transport certain hazardous materials regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss a rail accident or other incident or accident on our network at our facilities or at the facilities of our customers involving the release or combustion of hazardous materials could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury property damage and environmental penalties and remediation in excess of our insurance coverage for these risks which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

 

we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations – we rely on information technology in all aspects of our business including technology systems operated by us or under control of thirdparties if we do not have sufficient capital or do not deploy sufficient capital in a timely manner to acquire develop or implement new technology or maintain or upgrade current systems such as positive train control ptc or the latest version of our transportation control systems we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

 

we are subject to cybersecurity risks – we rely on information technology in all aspects of our business including technology systems operated by us whether created by us or purchased under control of thirdparties or opensource software although we devote significant resources to protect our technology systems and proprietary data we have experienced and will likely continue to experience varying degrees of cyber incidents in the normal course of business there can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect such incidents or attacks or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems after such incidents or attacks do occur furthermore due to the rising numbers and increasing sophistication of cyberattacks an increasingly complex information technology supply chain and the nature of zeroday exploits we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate preventative measures to prevent a security breach including by ransomware human error or other cyberattack methods from materially disrupting our systems or the systems of thirdparties a successful cyberattack may result in significant service interruption safety failure other operational difficulties unauthorized access to or the loss of access to competitively sensitive confidential or other critical data or systems loss of customers financial losses regulatory fines and misuse or corruption of critical data and proprietary information which could all have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity we may experience security breaches that could remain undetected for an extended period and therefore have a greater impact on the services we offer additionally we may be exposed to increased cybersecurity risk because we are a component of the critical us infrastructure

 

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures – as a railroad with a vast network we are exposed to severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods mudslides or landslides extreme temperatures avalanches and significant precipitation line outages and other interruptions caused by these conditions can adversely affect our entire rail network potentially negatively affecting revenue costs and liabilities despite efforts we undertake to plan for these events our revenues can also be adversely affected by severe weather that causes damage and disruptions to our customers these impacts caused by severe weather could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

 

 

a significant portion of our revenue involves transportation of commodities to and from international markets – although revenues from our operations are attributable to transportation services provided in the us a significant portion of our revenues involves the transportation of commodities to and from international markets including mexico canada and southeast asia by various carriers and at times various modes of transportation significant and sustained interruptions of trade with mexico canada or countries in southeast asia including china could adversely affect customers and other entities that directly or indirectly purchase or rely on rail transportation services in the us as part of their operations and any such interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity any one or more of the following could cause a significant and sustained interruption of trade with mexico canada or countries in southeast asia a a deterioration of security for international trade and businesses b the adverse impact of new laws rules and regulations or the interpretation of laws rules and regulations by government entities courts or regulatory bodies including the united statesmexicocanada agreement usmca and a “phase one” trade agreement with china c actions of taxing authorities that affect our customers doing business in foreign countries d any significant adverse economic developments such as extended periods of high inflation material disruptions in the banking sector or in the capital markets of these foreign countries and significant changes in the valuation of the currencies of these foreign countries that could materially affect the cost or value of imports or exports e shifts in patterns of international trade that adversely affect import and export markets f a material reduction in foreign direct investment in these countries and g public health crises including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease such as the coronavirus and its variant strains covid

 

we are dependent on certain key suppliers of locomotives and rail – due to the capitalintensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment parts and maintenance potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry therefore if one of the domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives discontinues manufacturing locomotives supplying parts or providing maintenance for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency or the inability to manufacture locomotives that meet efficiency or regulatory emissions standards we could experience significant cost increases and reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary for our operations additionally we utilize a limited number of steel producers that meet our specifications rail is critical to our operations for rail replacement programs maintenance and for adding additional network capacity new rail and storage yards and expansions of existing facilities this industry similarly has high barriers to entry and if one of these suppliers discontinues operations for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience both significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail for maintenance and other projects changes to trade agreements or policies that result in increased tariffs on goods imported into the united states could also result in significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail

 

human capital risks 

 

strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations – the us class i railroads are party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions the majority of our employees belong to labor unions and are subject to these agreements disputes over the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in among other things strikes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts which could cause a significant disruption of our operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could compromise our service reliability or significantly increase our costs for health care wages and other benefits which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity labor disputes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts at loadingunloading facilities ports or other transport access points could compromise our service reliability and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity labor disputes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts by employees of our customers or our suppliers could compromise our service reliability and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

 

the availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations – changes in demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel for us our customers and throughout the supply chain including the effects on availability from pandemic illnesses or restrictions including for example any potential effects from the coronavirus vaccine mandates could negatively affect our ability to meet demand for rail service unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

 

legal and regulatory risks 

 

we are subject to significant governmental regulation – we are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal state and local authorities covering a variety of health safety labor environmental economic as discussed below tax and other matters many laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses permits and other authorizations and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us governments or regulators may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks that we operate in without providing us any recourse to address any adverse effects on our business including without limitation regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution increasing the amount of our traffic subject to common carrier regulation business relationships with other railroads calculation of our cost of capital or other inputs relevant to computing our revenue adequacy the prices we charge changes in tax rates enactment of new tax laws and revision in tax regulations significant legislative activity in congress or regulatory activity by the stb could expand regulation of railroad operations and pricing for rail services which could reduce capital spending on our rail network facilities and equipment and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures – as a railroad with operations in densely populated urban areas and a vast rail network we are exposed to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage environmental liability and other matters any material changes to litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving any or all of property damage personal injury and environmental liability that exceed our insurance coverage for such risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

 

 

we are subject to significant environmental laws and regulations – due to the nature of the railroad business our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waters handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and hazardous material or petroleum releases we generate and transport hazardous and nonhazardous waste in our operations environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties leased properties properties owned by thirdparties as well as properties we currently own environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other thirdparties in toxic tort litigation we have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated or are strictly liable under these laws or regulations we currently have certain obligations at existing sites for investigation remediation and monitoring and we likely will have obligations at other sites in the future liabilities for these obligations affect our estimate based on our experience and as necessary the advice and assistance of our consultants however actual costs may vary from our estimates due to any or all of several factors including changes to environmental laws or interpretations of such laws technological changes affecting investigations and remediation the participation and financial viability of other parties responsible for any such liability and the corrective action or change to corrective actions required to remediate any existing or future sites we could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

 

macroeconomic and industry risks 

 

we face competition from other railroads and other transportation providers – we face competition from other railroads motor carriers ships barges and pipelines our main railroad competitor is burlington northern santa fe llc its primary subsidiary bnsf railway company bnsf operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors in addition we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers motor carrier competition exists for all three of our commodity groups excluding most coal shipments because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and gulf coast waterways barges can be particularly competitive especially for grain and bulk commodities in certain areas where we operate in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times quality and reliability of service from motor carriers and other railroads motor carriers in particular can have an advantage over railroads with respect to transit times and timeliness of service however railroads are much more fuelefficient than trucks which reduces the impact of transporting goods on the environment and public infrastructure and we have been making efforts to convert truck traffic to rail additionally we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system while trucks barges and maritime operators are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any of the following could also affect the competitiveness of our transportation services for some or all of our commodities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity i improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation such as autonomous or more fuel efficient trucks ii legislation that eliminates or significantly increases the size or weight limitations applied to motor carriers or iii legislation or regulatory changes that impose operating restrictions on railroads or that adversely affect the profitability of some or all railroad traffic many movements face product or geographic competition where our customers can use different products eg natural gas instead of coal sorghum instead of corn or commodities from different locations eg grain from states or countries that we do not serve crude oil from different regions sourcing different commodities or different locations allows shippers to substitute different carriers and such competition may reduce our volume or constrain prices additionally any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect our competitive environment

 

we may be affected by climate change and market or regulatory responses to climate change – climate change including the impact of global warming could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions of ghgs including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating costs restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that a use commodities that we carry to produce energy b use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry or c manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels including chemical producers farmers and food producers and automakers and other manufacturers significant cost increases government regulation or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy emissions reductions and ghg emissions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry and demand for our services which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy also could affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns including for example increasing royalties charged to producers of prb coal by the us department of interior and the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change violent weather caused by climate change including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods extreme temperatures avalanches and significant precipitation could cause line outages and other interruptions to our infrastructure any of these factors individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity while we work to implement our climate action plan our efforts to achieve emission reduction targets could significantly increase our operational costs and capital expenditures

 

 

our business financial condition and results of operations have been adversely affected and in the future could be materially adversely affected by pandemics or other public health crises  – our business financial condition and results of operations have been adversely affected by covid covid has caused and is expected to continue to cause a global slowdown of economic activity including the decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods disruptions in global supply chains and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets resulting further in adverse effects on workforces customers and regional and local economies other future pandemics or public health crises may cause these same or similar consequences because the severity magnitude and duration of the covid pandemic and its economic consequences are rapidly changing and difficult to predict the impact on our business and financial condition remains uncertain the ultimate impact of the covid pandemic on our results of operations and financial condition remains uncertain and depends on numerous evolving factors which we may not be able to effectively respond to and are not entirely within our control these factors also may be of importance for other pandemics or public health crises including but not limited to governmental business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to a global pandemic or other public health crises including restrictions on travel and transport workforce pressures social distancing and shelterinplace orders the effect of a pandemic or other public health crises on economic activity and actions taken in response the effect on our customers and their demand for our services the effect of a pandemic or other public health crises on the creditworthiness of our customers national or global supply chain challenges or disruption facility closures commodity cost volatility general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility global economic conditions and levels of economic growth and the pace of recovery as the pandemic subsides as well as response to a potential reoccurrence further a pandemic or other public health crises and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from such an event could also precipitate and aggravate the other risk factors that we identify which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations including revenues and profitability andor stock price additionally a pandemic or other public health crises also may affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations

 

financial risks 

 

we are affected by fluctuating fuel prices – fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses diesel fuel prices can be subject to dramatic fluctuations and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results although we currently are able to recover a significant amount of our fuel expenses from our customers through revenue from fuel surcharges we cannot be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elevated fuel costs through our fuel surcharges additionally future market conditions or legislative or regulatory activities could adversely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharges or adequately recover increased fuel costs through fuel surcharges as fuel prices fluctuate our fuel surcharge programs trail such fluctuations in fuel price by approximately two months and may be a significant source of quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear volatility particularly in periods of rapidly changing prices international political and economic factors events and conditions affect the volatility of fuel prices and supplies weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity a severe shortage of or disruption to domestic fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity alternatively lower fuel prices could have a positive impact on the economy by increasing consumer discretionary spending that potentially could increase demand for various consumer products we transport however lower fuel prices could have a negative impact on other commodities we transport such as coal and domestic drillingrelated shipments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

 

we rely on capital markets – due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements we utilize longterm debt instruments bank financing and commercial paper and we pledge certain amount of our receivables as collateral for credit significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets including the credit markets or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to and significantly increase the cost of commercial paper and other financing sources including bank credit facilities and the issuance of longterm debt including corporate bonds a significant deterioration of our financial condition could result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade which could restrict or at certain credit levels below investment grade may prohibit us from utilizing our current receivables securitization facility receivables facility this may also limit our access to external sources of capital and significantly increase the costs of short and longterm debt financing

 

general risk factors 

 

we are affected by general economic conditions – prolonged severe adverse domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of financial and credit markets including inflation may affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry and may have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity results of operations and financial condition

 

we may be affected by acts of terrorism war or risk of war – our rail lines facilities and equipment including rail cars carrying hazardous materials could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks terrorist attacks or other similar events any government response thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in addition insurance premiums for some or all of our current coverages could increase dramatically or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future

information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in this report in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting estimates – environmental item 7 and note 17 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8

 

 

other matters 

 

antitrust litigation – as we reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2007 20 rail shippers many of whom were represented by the same law firms filed virtually identical antitrust lawsuits in various federal district courts against us and four other class i railroads in the us currently uprr and three other class i railroads are the named defendants in the lawsuits the original plaintiff filed the first of these claims in the us district court in new jersey on may 14 2007 these suits alleged that the named railroads engaged in pricefixing by establishing common fuel surcharges for certain rail traffic

 

on august 16 2019 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit dc circuit affirmed the decision of us district court for the district of columbia us district court denying class certification the certification denial only five plaintiffs remain in this multidistrict litigation mdl originally filed in 2007 which remains pending they are proceeding on a consolidated basis in the us district court before the honorable paul l friedman mdl i since the certification denial approximately 111 lawsuits have been filed in federal court based on claims identical to those alleged in the class certification case the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation consolidated these suits for pretrial proceedings in the us district court before the honorable beryl a howell mdl ii

 

on february 19 2021 the court denied our motion to exclude plaintiffs alleged evidence of conspiracy under a federal statute designed to incent and protect railroad communications made to further interline service ie where two railroads are in the route in august 2021 the dc circuit agreed to hear defendants appeal oral argument is scheduled for march 7 2022 the appeal will address whether the interline evidence the plaintiffs intend to utilize to prove the alleged conspiracy is admissible either for purposes of summary judgment or at trial

 

we also filed a motion for summary judgment on may 14 2021 in the mdl i proceedings and the briefing was completed in september 2021 on october 20 2021 judge friedman issued an order stating that he will not consider the motions for summary judgment until after the dc circuit appeal mentioned above is decided 

 

as we reported in our current report on form 8k filed on june 10 2011 the railroad received a complaint filed in the us district court for the district of columbia on june 7 2011 by oxbow carbon  minerals llc and related entities oxbow just as it did in the mdl proceedings union pacific filed a motion for summary judgment on may 14 2021 and the briefing was completed in september 2021 as stated above the court issued an order that will not consider the motions for summary judgment until after the dc circuit appeal mentioned above is decided

 

we continue to deny the allegations that our fuel surcharge programs violate the antitrust laws or any other laws we believe that these lawsuits are without merit and we will vigorously defend our actions therefore we currently believe that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on any of our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

executive summary 

 

2021 results 

 

  

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid free cash flow is not considered a financial measure under gaap by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe free cash flow is important to management and investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financing free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for cash provided by operating activities the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities gaap measure to free cash flow nongaap measure

 

  

 

2022 outlook 

 

  

  

  

 

  

  

  

 

results of operations 

 

operating revenues 

 

  

we generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our three commodity groups freight revenues vary with volume carloads and arc changes in price traffic mix and fuel surcharges drive arc customer incentives which are primarily provided for shipping tofrom specific locations or based on cumulative volumes are recorded as a reduction to operating revenues customer incentives that include variable consideration based on cumulative volumes are estimated using the expected value method which is based on available historical current and forecasted volumes and recognized as the related performance obligation is satisfied we recognize freight revenues over time as shipments move from origin to destination the allocation of revenue between reporting periods is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred

 

other subsidiary revenues primarily logistics and commuter rail operations are generally recognized over time as shipments move from origin to destination the allocation of revenue between reporting periods is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred accessorial revenues are recognized at a point in time as performance obligations are satisfied

 

our freight revenues increased 11 yearoveryear to 202 billion driven by a 4 increase in volume higher fuel surcharge revenue core pricing gains and positive mix of traffic for example a relative increase in industrial shipments which have a higher arc volume increased in every key market segment compared to 2020 due to the recovery from the depressed economy brought on by the covid pandemic in 2020 while the markets have rebounded from 2020 our 2021 volume levels are 4 below 2019 prepandemic levels 

 

our fuel surcharge programs generated freight revenues of 17 billion and 10 billion in 2021 and 2020 respectively fuel surcharge revenue in 2021 increased 07 billion as a result of a 49 increase in fuel price and a 4 increase in carloadings partially offset by the lag impact on fuel surcharge it can generally take up to two months for changing fuel prices to affect fuel surcharges recoveries

 

in 2021 other subsidiary revenues were flat with 2020 as the semiconductor shortage negatively impacting 2021 automotive production offset the recovery from other covid related declines in 2020 accessorial revenue increased in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by increased intermodal accessorial charges tied to global supply chain disruptions other revenue was essentially flat yearoveryear

 

 

the following tables summarize the yearoveryear changes in freight revenues revenue carloads and arc by commodity type

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

mexico business – each of our commodity groups includes revenue from shipments to and from mexico revenue from mexico business was 24 billion in 2021 up 13 compared to 2020 driven by a 3 increase in volume and higher fuel surcharge revenue core pricing gains and positive mix of traffic the volume increase was driven by the recovery from the 2020 pandemic and an increase in petroleum and grain shipments partially offset by the impact of the global supply chain disruptions on intermodal shipments and the semiconductor shortage in the automotive industry

 

operating expenses 

 

  

 

 compensation and benefits – compensation and benefits include wages payroll taxes health and welfare costs pension costs and incentive costs in 2021 expenses increased 4 compared to 2020 due to volume related costs inflation 2020 management actions responding to the sharp decline in volume temporary unpaid leave salary reductions and shop closures incentive compensation and higher costs due to weather and wildfirerelated events partially offsetting these increases were productivity initiatives resulting in employee levels that declined 3 compared to 2020 despite a 4 volume increase a 2020 onetime bonus payment for agreement employees who worked during the pandemic and lower severance costs

 

depreciation – the majority of depreciation relates to road property including rail ties ballast and other track material depreciation expense was flat in 2021 compared to 2020

 

fuel – fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and nonhighway vehicles and heavy equipment locomotive diesel fuel prices which averaged 223 per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in 2021 compared to 150 per gallon in 2020 increased expenses 668 million excluding any impact from increased volume yearoveryear gross tonmiles increased 6 driving higher fuel expense partially offsetting this increase was a 1 improvement to a record low fuel consumption rate computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross tonmiles

 

purchased services and materials – expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors and other service providers including equipment maintenance and contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services materials used to maintain the railroad’s lines structures and equipment costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other railroads transportation and lodging for train crew employees trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers leased automobile maintenance expenses and tools and supplies purchased services and materials increased 3 in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by inflation higher professional services expense volumerelated costs associated with our intermodal business higher costs due to weather and wildfirerelated events increased locomotive and freight car maintenance expense as we added resources to the network and higher costs for transportation of train crews

 

equipment and other rents – equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies freight car intermodal and locomotive leases and office and other rent expenses offset by equity income from certain equity method investments equipment and other rents expense decreased 2 compared to 2020 driven by lower rent on equipment in storage and higher equity income from our investment in ttx company partially offset by increased freight car rent expense due to volume increases and slower freight car velocity

 

other – other expenses include state and local taxes freight equipment and property damage utilities insurance personal injury environmental employee travel telephone and cellular computer software bad debt and other general expenses other expenses decreased 13 in 2021 compared to 2020 as a result of a 278 million noncash impairment charge related to our brazos yard investment in 2020 lower writeoffs of cancelled inprogress capital projects 2020 lease impairments and higher equity income partially offsetting these decreases were increased casualty expenses including personal injury damaged freight and environmental and higher state and local taxes both periods in 2021 and 2020 included a reduction of expense for weather and wildfirerelated insurance reimbursements 6 million and 25 million respectively

 

nonoperating items 

 

  

other income net – other income increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to a 36 million gain from the sale of an investment in a technology company partially offset by lower real estate sale gains real estate sales in 2021 included a 50 million gain from a property sale to the colorado department of transportation while 2020 included a 69 million gain from a land and permanent easement sale to the illinois state toll highway authority

 

interest expense – interest expense increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to an increased weightedaverage debt level of 283 billion in 2021 from 279 billion in 2020 the effective interest rate was 41 for both periods 

 

income taxes – income tax expense increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to higher pretax income our effective tax rates for 2021 and 2020 were 231 and 234 respectively

 

 

other operatingperformance and financial statistics 

 

we report a number of key performance measures weekly to the stb we provide this data on our website at wwwupcominvestoraarstbreportsindexhtm

 

operatingperformance statistics 

 

management continuously measures these key operating metrics to evaluate our operational efficiency and asset utilization in striving to provide a consistent reliable service product to our customers

 

railroad performance measures are included in the table below

 

  

  

gross and revenue tonmiles – gross tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled revenue tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles in 2021 gross tonmiles and revenue tonmiles increased 6 and 7 respectively compared to 2020 driven by a 4 increase in carloadings changes in commodity mix drove the variance in yearoveryear increases between gross tonmiles revenue tonmiles and carloads smaller increases in our intermodal and automotive shipments which are generally lighter coupled with higher increases in grain and industrial shipments which are generally heavier

 

freight car velocity – freight car velocity measures the average daily miles per car on our network the two key drivers of this metric are the speed of the train between terminals average train speed and the time a rail car spends at the terminals average terminal dwell time train speed slowed and terminal dwell increased in 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 as the network handled additional volume and was impacted by weather and wildfirerelated challenges bridge outages caused by the california wildfires other incidents causing delays on the network and global supply chain disruptions continued implementation of our operating plan helped to partially offset these impacts

 

locomotive productivity – locomotive productivity is gross tonmiles per average daily locomotive horsepower locomotive productivity decreased 3 in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by the increased active fleet needed to handle the 4 volume increase as well as manage network disruptions partially offset by transportation plan changes

 

train length – train length is the average maximum train length on a route measured in feet our train length increased 6 compared to 2020 as a result of blending service products and transportation plan changes designed to improve overall operational efficiency however in the second half of the year train length declined slightly from the first half of 2021 due to california wildfire bridge outage reroutes in the third quarter and operational challenges in the fourth quarter

 

car trip plan compliance – car trip plan compliance is the percentage of cars delivered on time in accordance with our original trip plan our network trip plan compliance is broken into the intermodal and manifestautomotive products intermodal trip plan compliance deteriorated in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to global supply chain disruptions manifestautomotive trip plan compliance deteriorated in 2021 compared to 2020 as our network slowed because of the outages and incidents described above that required increased resource allocation and rebalancing 

 

workforce productivity – workforce productivity is average daily car miles per employee workforce productivity improved 10 reaching an alltime record as employee counts were down 3 compared to 2020 while average daily car miles increased 6 productivity initiatives and a smaller capital workforce offset higher train and engine employee levels due to weather and wildfirerelated challenges network disruptions and reduced crew utilization keeping total employee levels lower than 2020

 

operating ratio – operating ratio is our operating expenses reflected as a percentage of operating revenue our operating ratio of 572 was an alltime record and improved 27 points compared to 2020 mainly driven by a 2020 onetime impairment core pricing gains productivity initiatives and positive mix of traffic which were partially offset by higher fuel prices inflation and other cost increases

 

 

return on average common shareholders ’ equity 

 

  

return on invested capital as adjusted roic 

 

  

roic is considered a nongaap financial measure by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our longterm capital investments in addition we currently use roic as a performance criterion in determining certain elements of equity compensation for our executives roic should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for other information provided in accordance with gaap the most comparable gaap measure is return on average common shareholders’ equity the tables above provide reconciliations from return on average common shareholders’ equity to roic at december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 the incremental borrowing rate on operating leases was 32 37 and 37 respectively

 

adjusted debt  adjusted ebitda 

 

  

adjusted debt to adjusted ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and adjustments for other income and interest on present value of operating leases is considered a nongaap financial measure by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the company’s ability to sustain given debt levels including leases with the cash generated from operations in addition a comparable measure is used by rating agencies when reviewing the company’s credit rating adjusted debt to adjusted ebitda should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for net income the table above provides reconciliations from net income to adjusted debt to adjusted ebitda at december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 the incremental borrowing rate on operating leases was 32 37 and 37 respectively

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

we are continually evaluating our financial condition and liquidity we analyze a wide range of economic scenarios and the impact on our ability to generate cash these analyses inform our liquidity plans and activities outlined below and indicate we have sufficient borrowing capacity to sustain an extended period of lower volumes

 

at december 31 2021 we had a working capital deficit due to upcoming debt maturities at december 31 2020 we had a surplus due to an increased cash balance held due to the uncertainty related to covid it is not unusual for us to have a working capital deficit and we believe it is not an indication of a lack of liquidity we also maintain adequate resources including our credit facility and when necessary access the capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements

 

during the year we generated 90 billion of cash from operating activities completed a 17 billion debt exchange and issued 35 billion of longterm debt we have been and we expect to continue to be in compliance with our debt covenants we increased the dividend twice during 2021 paying out 28 billion and repurchased shares totaling 73 billion including the completion of our 2 billion accelerated share repurchase programs entered into on may 25 2021

 

our principal sources of liquidity include cash cash equivalents our receivables facility our revolving credit facility as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets on december 31 2021 we had 960 million of cash and cash equivalents 20 billion of committed credit available under our revolving credit facility and up to 500 million undrawn on the receivables facility as of december 31 2021 none of the revolving credit facility was drawn and we did not draw on our revolving credit facility at any time during 2021 at december 31 2021 we had 300 million of the receivables facility drawn 400 million of commercial paper and a 100 million term loan outstanding our access to the receivables facility may be reduced or restricted if our bond ratings fall to certain levels below investment grade if our bond rating were to deteriorate it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financing is dependent on market conditions deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability we expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity through any or all the following sources or activities i increasing the utilization of our receivables facility ii issuing commercial paper iii entering into bank loans outside of our revolving credit facility or iv issuing bonds or other debt securities to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets the company’s 20 billion revolving credit facility is intended to support the issuance of commercial paper by upc and also serves as an additional source of liquidity to fund shortterm needs the company currently does not intend to make any borrowings under this facility

 

as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and as referenced in the table below we have contractual obligations that may affect our financial condition based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets as described in item 1a of part ii of this report there is no known trend demand commitment event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition our commercial obligations financings and commitments are customary transactions that are like those of other comparable corporations particularly within the transportation industry

 

the following table identifies material obligations as of december 31 2021

 

  

  

libor transition – see note 14 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 the use of an alternative rate or benchmark may negatively impact the terms of our facilities including in the form of an adverse effect on interest rates and higher borrowing costs and interest expense

 

 

  

operating activities 

 

cash provided by operating activities increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to an increase in net income partially offset by higher receivables and the partial payment of the deferred 2020 employment tax that was allowed by a provision in the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act

 

cash flow conversion – cash flow conversion is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in capital investments as a ratio of net income

 

cash flow conversion rate is not considered a financial measure under gaap by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe cash flow conversion rate is important to management and investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financing cash flow conversion rate should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for cash provided by operating activities

 

the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities gaap measure to cash flow conversion rate nongaap measure

 

  

investing activities 

 

cash used in investing activities in 2021 increased compared to 2020 primarily driven by increased capital investment in road infrastructure replacements

 

the following tables detail cash capital investments and track statistics for the years ended december 31

 

   

  

 

capital plan – in 2022 we expect our capital plan to be approximately 33 billion up 10 compared to 2021 we will continue to harden our infrastructure replace older assets and improve the safety and resiliency of the network in addition the plan includes targeted freight car acquisitions investments in growthrelated projects to drive more carloads to the network certain ramps to efficiently handle volumes from new and existing intermodal customers continuous modernization of our locomotive fleet and projects intended to improve operational efficiency  the capital plan may be revised if business conditions warrant or if new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments 

 

financing activities 

 

cash used in financing activities increased in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by increased share repurchases

 

see note 14 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 for a description of all our outstanding financing arrangements and significant new borrowings and note 18 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 for a description of our share repurchase programs

 

other matters 

 

inflation – for capitalintensive companies inflation significantly increases asset replacement costs for longlived assets as a result assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels depreciation charges on an inflationadjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts

 

sensitivity analyses – the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest and tax rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results

 

interest rates  – at december 31 2021 we had variablerate debt representing approximately 27 of our total debt if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2022 than our december 31 2021 variable rate which was approximately 07 our interest expense would increase by approximately 80 million this amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balances of our variablerate debt at december 31 2021

 

market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2021 and amounts to an increase of approximately 49 billion to the fair value of our debt at december 31 2021 we estimated the fair values of our fixedrate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates

 

tax rates   – our deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on current tax law future tax legislation such as a change in the corporate tax rate could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity for example a permanent 1 increase in future income tax rates would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately 500 million similarly a permanent 1 decrease in future income tax rates would decrease our deferred tax liability by approximately 500 million

 

accounting pronouncements – see note 3 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8

 

asserted and unasserted claims – see note 17 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8

 

indemnities – see note 17 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8

 

climate change – although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance see risk factors under item 1a of this report we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact in december 2021 we released our initial climate action plan which outlines the steps we are taking to reduce our environmental impact this plan aligns with our corporate strategy serve improve operational efficiency and minimize fuel consumption grow offer sustainable supply chain solutions win decarbonize our footprint and the environment together engage our stakeholders and align interests we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce our operational impact on the environment including increased usage of renewable fuels investments in new technologies using training programs and technology to reduce fuel consumption and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency see sustainable future in the operations section in item 1 of this report

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the following critical accounting estimates are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 2 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 these critical accounting estimates affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material

 

 

personal injury – see note 17 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 and  we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures in the risk factors item 1a

 

our personal injury liability is subject to uncertainty due to unasserted claims timing and outcome of claims and evolving trends in litigation there were no material changes to the assumptions used in the latest actuarial analysis

 

our personal injury liability balance and claims activity was as follows

 

  

environmental costs – see note 17 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8  we are subject to significant environmental laws and regulations in the risk factors item 1a and environmental matters in the legal proceedings item 3

 

our environmental liability is subject to several factors such as type of remediation nature and volume of contaminate and number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties as well as uncertainty due to unknown alleged contamination evolving trends in remediation techniques and final remedies and changes in laws and regulations

 

our environmental liability balance and site activity was as follows

 

  

property and depreciation – see note 11 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8

 

assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property

 

estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to changes in physical use technology asset strategies and other factors that will have an impact on the retirement profiles of our assets we are not aware of any specific factors that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service lives of our assets actual use and retirement of our assets may vary from our current estimates which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future periods

 

changes in estimated useful lives of our assets due to the results of our depreciation studies could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately 69 million if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were decreased by one year annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately 73 million we are projecting an increase in our depreciation expense by approximately 2 in 2022 versus 2021 this is driven by an increase in our projected depreciable asset base  

 

during the last three fiscal years no gains or losses were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad properties

 

pension plans  – see note 5 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 

 

the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rates and expected rate of return on pension assets 

 

we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually and selected assumptions are based on the following factors

 

  

 

the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure net periodic pension costbenefit for 2022 and the estimated impact on 2022 net periodic pension costbenefit relative to a change in those assumptions

 

  

  

the following table presents the net periodic pension cost for the years ended december 31

bulk – the companys bulk shipments consist of grain and grain products fertilizer food and refrigerated and coal and renewables in 2020 this group generated 33 of our freight revenue we access most major grain markets connecting the midwest and western us producing areas to export terminals in the pacific northwest and gulf coast ports as well as mexico we also serve significant domestic markets including grain processors animal feeders and ethanol producers in the midwest and west fertilizer movements originate in the gulf coast region midwest western us and canada through interline access for delivery to major agricultural users in those areas as well as abroad the railroad’s network supports the transportation of coal shipments to independent and regulated power companies and industrial facilities throughout the us through interchange gateways and ports uprr’s reach extends to eastern us utilities as well as to mexico and other international destinations coal traffic originating in the powder river basin prb area of wyoming is the largest segment of the railroad’s coal business renewable shipments for customers committed to sustainability consist primarily of biomass exports and wind turbine components 

industrial – our extensive network facilitates the movement of numerous commodities between thousands of origin and destination points throughout north america the industrial group consists of several categories including construction industrial chemicals plastics forest products specialized products primarily waste salt roofing and government metals and ores petroleum liquid petroleum gases lpg and soda ash transportation of these products accounted for 36 of our freight revenue in 2020 commercial residential and governmental infrastructure investments drive shipments of steel aggregates cement and wood products industrial and light manufacturing plants receive steel nonferrous materials minerals and other raw materials 

the industrial chemicals market consists of a vast number of chemical compounds that support the manufacturing of more complex chemicals plastics shipments support automotive housing and the durable and disposable consumer goods markets  forest product shipments include lumber and paper commodities lumber shipments originate primarily in the pacific northwest or western canada and move 

throughout the us for use in new home construction and repairs and remodeling paper shipments primarily support packaging needs oil and gas drilling generates demand for raw steel finished pipe stone and drilling fluid commodities t he company’s petroleum and lpg shipments are primarily impacted by refinery utilization rates regional crude pricing differentials pipeline capacity and the use of asphalt for road programs soda ash originates in southwestern wyoming and california destined for chemical and glass producing markets in north america and abroad 

premium – in 2020 premium shipments generated 31 of union pacific’s total freight revenue premium includes finished automobiles automotive parts and merchandise in intermodal containers both domestic and international international business consists of import and export traffic moving in 20 or 40foot shipping containers that mainly pass through west coast ports served by up’s extensive terminal network domestic business includes container and trailer traffic picked up and delivered within north america for intermodal marketing companies primarily shipper agents and logistics companies as well as truckload carriers

seasonality – some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons reflecting either or both the nature of the commodity and the demand cycle for the commodity such as certain agricultural and food products that have specific growing and harvesting seasons the peak shipping seasons for these commodities can vary considerably each year depending upon various factors including the strength of domestic and international economies and currencies and the strength of harvests and market prices for agricultural products 

proud  engaged workforce – we recruit and develop talented individuals dedicated to our mission of service and who are passionate about performing to the best of their abilities while working as one team we recognize and value that people come from all backgrounds and walks of life and we value diversity union pacific wants employees from all groups to launch and grow their career within the company 

attracting acquiring and maintaining a diverse workforce provides access to the skills and character we need to foster innovative ideas and drive optimal business growth drawing on different experiences and expertise is critical for strategic decisionmaking problemsolving leadership development and creativity 

union pacific’s commitment – today and for the long run is to further improve and strengthen performance through an inclusive workforce that reflects the diverse markets and communities we serve recognizing we still have work to do we continue to focus on building an inclusive culture and a talented workforce and marketplace with a goal to reach 40 minority and 11 female representation in total for the company by 2030 as of december 31 2020 workforce representation of minorities and females was approximately 30 and 6 respectively 

safety is union pacific’s first priority we continue to improve technology enhance processes and foster a culture focused on operating safely as well as remaining focused on identifying and managing risks and training our employees our success is measured by our personal injury rate the number of reportable injuries for every 200000 employeehours worked and our equipment incident rate the number of reportable equipment incidents per million train miles we provide both measures to the federal railroad administration fra personal injuries are defined as on duty incidents or occupational illnesses that require employees to lose time away from work modify their normal duties or receive certain types of medical treatment equipment incidents are defined as any occurrence that causes damage to assets above the monetary reporting threshold regardless of ownership 10700 for 2020 and 11200 for 2021 

our goal is to have every employee return home safely every day unfortunately our 2020 personal injury rate of 090 and equipment incident rate of 354 illustrates that we have not met our ultimate goal of an incident free environment our 2020 personal injury rate was flat and our equipment incident rate improved 17 versus 2019  see further discussion in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item 7 of this report 

providing employees with fulfilling familysupporting careers is important to us we offer competitive compensation to our employees and leadership our board of directors evaluates our compensation plans

railroad security – our security efforts consist of a wide variety of measures including employee training engagement with our customers training of emergency responders and partnerships with numerous federal state and local government agencies while federal law requires us to protect the confidentiality of our security plans designed to safeguard against terrorism and other security incidents the following provides a general overview of our security initiatives 

uprr security measures – we maintain a comprehensive security plan designed to both deter and respond to any potential or actual threats as they arise the plan includes four levels of alert status each with its own set of countermeasures we employ our own police force consisting of commissioned and highlytrained officers the police are certified state law enforcement officers with investigative and arrest powers the union pacific police department has achieved accreditation under the commission on accreditation for law enforcement agencies inc calea for complying with the highest law enforcement standards our employees also undergo recurrent security and preparedness training as well as federallymandated hazardous materials and security training we regularly review the sufficiency of our employee training programs we maintain the capability to move critical operations to backup facilities in different locations 

we operate an emergency response management center 24 hours a day the center receives reports of emergencies dangerous or potentially dangerous conditions and other safety and security issues from our employees the public law enforcement and other government officials in cooperation with government officials we monitor both threats and public events and as necessary we may alter rail traffic flow at times of concern to minimize risk to communities and our operations we comply with the hazardous materials routing rules and other requirements imposed by federal law we also design our operating plan to expedite the movement of hazardous material shipments to minimize the time rail cars remain idle at yards and terminals located in or near major population centers additionally in compliance with transportation security agency regulations we deployed information systems and instructed employees in tracking and documenting the handoff of rail security sensitive materials with customers and interchange partners 

we also have established a number of our own innovative safety and securityoriented initiatives ranging from various investments in technology to the officer on train program which provides local law enforcement officers with the opportunity to ride with train crews to enhance their understanding of railroad operations and risks our staff of information security professionals continually assesses cyber security risks and implements mitigation programs that evolve with the changing technology threat environment to date we have not experienced any material disruption of our operations due to a cyber threat or attack directed at us we also evaluated details regarding the solarwinds supply chain attack and do not believe our systems were affected 

cooperation with federal state and local government agencies – we work closely on physical and cyber security initiatives with government agencies including the us department of transportation dot the department of homeland security dhs as well as local police departments fire departments and other first responders in conjunction with the association of american railroads aar we sponsor ask rail a mobile application which provides first responders with secure links to electronic information including commodity and emergency response information required by emergency personnel to respond to accidents and other situations we also participate in the national joint terrorism task force a multiagency effort established by the us department of justice and the federal bureau of investigation to combat and prevent terrorism 

we work with the coast guard us customs and border protection cbp and the military transport management command which monitor shipments entering the uprr rail network at us border crossings and ports we were the first railroad in the us to be named a partner in cbp’s customstrade partnership 

against terrorism a partnership designed to develop enhance and maintain effective security processes throughout the global supply chain 

cooperation with customers and trade associations – through transcaer transportation community awareness and emergency response we work with the aar the american chemistry council the american petroleum institute and other chemical trade groups to provide communities with preparedness tools including the training of emergency responders in cooperation with the fra and other interested groups we are also working to develop additional improvements to tank car design that will further limit the risk of releases of hazardous materials

governmental and environmental regulation 

governmental regulation – our operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local regulations generally applicable to all businesses see also the discussion of certain regulatory proceedings in legal proceedings item 3 

the operations of the railroad are also subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board stb the stb has jurisdiction over rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic common carrier service of regulated traffic freight car compensation transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines and acquisition of control of rail common carriers the stb continues its efforts to explore expanding rail regulation and is reviewing proposed rulemaking in various areas including reciprocal switching commodity exemptions and expanding and easing procedures for smaller rate complaints the stb also continues to develop a methodology for determining railroad revenue adequacy and the possible use of a revenue adequacy constraint in regulating railroad rates the stb posts quarterly reports on rate reasonableness cases and maintains a database on service complaints and has the authority to initiate investigations among other things 

the operations of the railroad also are subject to the regulations of the fra and other federal and state agencies in 2010 the fra issued initial rules governing installation of positive train control ptc ptc is a safety technology intended to prevent certain accidents caused by human error such as traintotrain collisions derailments caused by overspeed movement of a train through a misaligned switch and unauthorized movement of trains into work zones the surface transportation extension act of 2015 amended the rail safety improvement act to require implementation of ptc by the end of 2018 which was extended to december 31 2020 on december 10 2018 we received fra approval for an alternative schedule to implement test and refine our ptc system during 20192020 as of december 31 2020 ptc 

has been implemented and installed on 100 percent of our required rail lines including required passenger train routes and interoperability has been established with all other ptc host and tenant railroads through 2020 we have invested approximately 29 billion in the implementation and ongoing development of ptc we are now moving to further leverage the ptc system through development and implementation of new operating technologies such as fuel and intrain forces management systems 

dot the occupational safety and health administration the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration and dhs along with other federal agencies have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety movement of hazardous materials and hazardous waste emissions requirements and equipment standards additionally various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law  

environmental regulation – we are subject to extensive federal and state environmental statutes and regulations pertaining to public health and the environment the statutes and regulations are administered and monitored by the environmental protection agency epa and by various state environmental agencies the primary laws affecting our operations are the resource conservation and recovery act regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act regulating the cleanup of contaminated properties the clean air act regulating air emissions and the clean water act regulating waste water discharges

 i tem 1a risk factors 

the following discussion addresses significant factors events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky and provides important information for the understanding of our “forwardlooking statements” which are discussed immediately preceding item 7a of this form 10k and elsewhere the risk factors set forth in this item 1a should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this report including management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item 7 and financial statements and supplementary data item 8 

we urge you to consider carefully the factors described below and the risks that they present for our operations as well as the risks addressed in other reports and materials that we file with the sec and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k when the factors events and contingencies described below or elsewhere in this form 10k materialize our business reputation financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects can be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations cash flows and prospects 

strategic and operational risks 

we must manage fluctuating demand for our services and network capacity – if there are significant reductions in demand for rail services with respect to one or more commodities or changes in consumer preferences that affect the businesses of our customers we may experience increased costs associated with resizing our operations including higher unit operating costs and costs for the storage of locomotives rail cars and other equipment workforce adjustments and other related activities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity if there is significant demand for our services that exceeds the designed capacity of our network we may experience network difficulties including congestion and reduced velocity that could compromise the level of service we provide to our customers this level of demand may also compound the impact of weather and weatherrelated events on our operations and velocity although we continue to improve our transportation plan add capacity improve operations at our yards and other facilities and improve our ability to address surges in demand for any reason with adequate resources we cannot be sure that these measures will fully or adequately address any service shortcomings resulting from demand exceeding our planned capacity we may experience other operational or service difficulties related to network capacity dramatic and unplanned fluctuations in our customers’ demand for rail service with respect to one or more commodities or operating 

regions or other events that could negatively impact our operational efficiency which could all have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we transport hazardous materials – we transport certain hazardous materials and other materials including crude oil ethanol and toxic inhalation hazard tih materials such as chlorine that pose certain risks in the event of a release or combustion additionally us laws impose common carrier obligations on railroads that require us to transport certain hazardous materials regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss a rail accident or other incident or accident on our network at our facilities or at the facilities of our customers involving the release or combustion of hazardous materials could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury property damage and environmental penalties and remediation in excess of our insurance coverage for these risks which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations – we rely on information technology in all aspects of our business including technology systems operated by us or under control of third parties if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire develop or implement new technology or maintain or upgrade current systems such as ptc or the latest version of our transportation control systems we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to cybersecurity risks – we rely on information technology in all aspects of our business including technology systems operated by us or under control of third parties although we devote significant resources to protect our technology systems and proprietary data we have experienced and will continue to experience varying degrees of cyber incidents in the normal course of business while there can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect such incidents or attacks or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems after such incidents or attacks do occur we are continually evaluating attackers’ techniques and tactics and we are diligent in our monitoring training planning and prevention however due to the rising rates and increasing sophistication of cyberattacks an increasingly complex it supply chain and the nature of zeroday exploits we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate preventative measures to prevent a security breach including by ransomware human error or other cyberattack methods from disrupting our systems or the systems of third parties a successful cyberattack may result in significant service interruption safety failure other operational difficulties unauthorized access to or the loss of access to competitively sensitive confidential or other critical data or systems loss of customers financial losses regulatory fines and misuse or corruption of critical data and proprietary information which could all have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity we also may experience security breaches that could remain undetected for an extended period and therefore have a greater impact on the services we offer 

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures – as a railroad with a vast network we are exposed to severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods mudslides or landslides extreme temperatures avalanches and significant precipitation line outages and other interruptions caused by these conditions can adversely affect our entire rail network potentially negatively affecting revenue costs and liabilities despite efforts we undertake to plan for these events our revenues can also be adversely affected by severe weather that causes damage and disruptions to our customers these impacts caused by severe weather could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

a significant portion of our revenue involves transportation of commodities to and from international markets – although revenues from our operations are attributable to transportation services provided in the us a significant portion of our revenues involves the transportation of commodities to and from international markets including mexico canada and southeast asia by various carriers and at times various modes of transportation significant and sustained interruptions of trade with mexico canada or countries in southeast asia including china could adversely affect customers and other entities that directly or indirectly purchase or rely on rail transportation services in the us as part of their operations and any such interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity any one or more of the following could cause a significant and sustained interruption of trade with mexico canada or countries in southeast asia a a deterioration of security for international trade and businesses b the adverse impact of new laws rules and regulations or the interpretation of laws rules and regulations by government entities courts or regulatory bodies including the united statesmexicocanada agreement usmca and a “phase one” trade agreement with china c actions 

of taxing authorities that affect our customers doing business in foreign countries d any significant adverse economic developments such as extended periods of high inflation material disruptions in the banking sector or in the capital markets of these foreign countries and significant changes in the valuation of the currencies of these foreign countries that could materially affect the cost or value of imports or exports e shifts in patterns of international trade that adversely affect import and export markets f a material reduction in foreign direct investment in these countries and g public health crises including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease such as the novel coronavirus and its variant strains 

we are dependent on certain key suppliers of locomotives and rail – due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment parts and maintenance potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry therefore if one of the domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives discontinues manufacturing locomotives supplying parts or providing maintenance for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience significant cost increases and reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary for our operations additionally for a high percentage of our rail purchases we utilize two steel producers one domestic and one international that meet our specifications rail is critical to our operations for rail replacement programs maintenance and for adding additional network capacity new rail and storage yards and expansions of existing facilities this industry similarly has high barriers to entry and if one of these suppliers discontinues operations for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience both significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail for maintenance and other projects changes to trade agreements or policies that result in increased tariffs on goods imported into the united states could also result in significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail 

human capital risks 

strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations – the us class i railroads are party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions the majority of our employees belong to labor unions and are subject to these agreements disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in among other things strikes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts which could cause a significant disruption of our operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could compromise our service reliability or significantly increase our costs for health care wages and other benefits which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity labor disputes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts at loadingunloading facilities ports or other transport access points could compromise our service reliability and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity labor disputes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts by employees of our customers or our suppliers could compromise our service reliability and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

the availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations – changes in demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel including the effects on availability from pandemic illnesses or restrictions could negatively affect our ability to meet demand for rail service unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to significant governmental regulation – we are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal state and local authorities covering a variety of health safety labor environmental economic as discussed below tax and other matters many laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses permits and other authorizations and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us governments or regulators may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate without providing us any recourse to address any adverse effects on our business including without limitation regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution increasing the amount of our traffic subject to common carrier regulation business relationships with other railroads calculation of our cost of capital or other inputs relevant to computing our revenue adequacy the prices we charge changes in tax rates enactment of new tax laws and revision in tax regulations significant legislative activity in congress or regulatory activity by the stb could expand regulation of 

railroad operations and prices for rail services which could reduce capital spending on our rail network facilities and equipment and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity for example enacted federal legislation mandated the implementation of ptc technology by december 31 2020 which we invested approximately 29 billion to develop additionally one or more consolidations of class i railroads also could lead to increased regulation of the rail industry 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures – as a railroad with operations in densely populated urban areas and a vast rail network we are exposed to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage environmental liability and other matters any material changes to litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving any or all of property damage personal injury and environmental liability that exceed our insurance coverage for such risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to significant environmental laws and regulations – due to the nature of the railroad business our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waters handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and hazardous material or petroleum releases we generate and transport hazardous and nonhazardous waste in our operations environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties leased properties properties owned by third parties as well as properties we currently own environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation we have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated or are strictly liable under these laws or regulations we currently have certain obligations at existing sites for investigation remediation and monitoring and we likely will have obligations at other sites in the future liabilities for these obligations affect our estimate based on our experience and as necessary the advice and assistance of our consultants however actual costs may vary from our estimates due to any or all of several factors including changes to environmental laws or interpretations of such laws technological changes affecting investigations and remediation the participation and financial viability of other parties responsible for any such liability and the corrective action or change to corrective actions required to remediate any existing or future sites we could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

macroeconomic and industry risks 

we face competition from other railroads and other transportation providers – we face competition from other railroads motor carriers ships barges and pipelines our main railroad competitor is burlington northern santa fe llc its primary subsidiary bnsf railway company bnsf operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors in addition we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers motor carrier competition exists for all three of our commodity groups excluding most coal shipments because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and gulf coast waterways barges can be particularly competitive especially for grain and bulk commodities in certain areas where we operate in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times quality and reliability of service from motor carriers and other railroads motor carriers in particular can have an advantage over railroads with respect to transit times and timeliness of service however railroads are much more fuelefficient than trucks which reduces the impact of transporting goods on the environment and public infrastructure and we have been making efforts to convert truck traffic to rail additionally we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system while trucks barges and maritime operators are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any of the following could also affect the competitiveness of our transportation services for some or all of our commodities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity i improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation such as autonomous or more fuel efficient trucks ii legislation that eliminates or significantly increases the size or weight limitations applied to motor carriers or iii legislation or regulatory changes that impose operating restrictions on railroads or that adversely affect the profitability of some or all railroad traffic m any movements face product or geographic competition where our customers can use different products eg natural gas instead of coal sorghum instead of corn or commodities from different locations eg grain from states or countries that we do not serve crude oil from different regions sourcing different commodities or different locations allows shippers to substitute different carriers and such competition may reduce our volume or constrain prices additionally any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect our competitive environment 

we may be affected by climate change and market or regulatory responses to climate change – climate change including the impact of global warming could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gasses including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating costs restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that a use commodities that we carry to produce energy b use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry or c manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels including chemical producers farmers and food producers and automakers and other manufacturers significant cost increases government regulation or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy also could affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns including for example increasing royalties charged to producers of prb coal by the us department of interior and the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change violent weather caused by climate change including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods extreme temperatures avalanches and significant precipitation could cause line outages and other interruptions to our infrastructure any of these factors individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

our business financial condition  and results of operations ha ve been adversely affected and in the future could be materially adversely affected by pandemic s   – our business financial condition  and results of operations have been adversely affected by the coronavirus  covid19  pandemic and may be affected by other pandemics covid19 has caused and is expected to continue to cause a global slowdown of economic activity including the decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods disruptions in global supply chains  and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets and that also has adversely affected workforces customers and regional and local economies other future pandemics may cause these same or similar consequences because the severity magnitude  and duration of the covid19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain rapidly changing  and difficult to predict the impact on our business and financial condition remains uncertain and difficult to predict the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic on our results of operations and financial condition remains uncertain and depends on numerous evolving factors which we may not be able to effectively respond to and are not entirely within our control  these factors also may be of importance for other pandemics  including but not limited to governmental business  and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to a global pandemic including restrictions on travel and transport workforce pressures  and social distancing  and shelterinplace orders the effect of a pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response the effect on our customers and their demand for our services the effect of a pandemic on the creditworthiness of our customers national or global supply chain challenges or disruption facility closures commodity cost volatility general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility global economic conditions and levels of economic growth and the pace of recovery as the pandemic subsides as well as response to a potential reoccurrence further a pandemic and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from a pandemic could also precipitate and aggravate the other risk factors that we identify which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations including revenues and profitability  andor stock price additionally a pandemic also may affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations 

financial risks 

we are affected by fluctuating fuel prices – fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses diesel fuel prices can be subject to dramatic fluctuations and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results although we currently are able to recover a significant amount of our fuel expenses from our customers through revenue from fuel surcharges we cannot be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elevated fuel costs through our fuel surcharges additionally future market conditions or legislative or regulatory activities could adversely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharges or adequately recover increased fuel costs through fuel surcharges as fuel prices fluctuate our fuel surcharge programs trail such fluctuations in fuel price by approximately two months and may be a significant source of quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear 

volatility particularly in periods of rapidly changing prices international political and economic factors events and conditions affect the volatility of fuel prices and supplies weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity a severe shortage of or disruption to domestic fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity alternatively lower fuel prices could have a positive impact on the economy by increasing consumer discretionary spending that potentially could increase demand for various consumer products we transport however lower fuel prices could have a negative impact on other commodities we transport such as coal and domestic drillingrelated shipments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we rely on capital markets – due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements we utilize longterm debt instruments bank financing and commercial paper from timetotime and we pledge certain of our receivables significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets including the credit markets or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to and significantly increase the cost of commercial paper and other financing sources including bank credit facilities and the issuance of longterm debt including corporate bonds a significant deterioration of our financial condition could result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade which could restrict or at certain credit levels below investment grade may prohibit us from utilizing our current receivables securitization facility this may also limit our access to external sources of capital and significantly increase the costs of short and longterm debt financing 

general risk factors 

we are affected by general economic conditions – prolonged severe adverse domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of financial and credit markets may affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry and may have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity results of operations and financial condition 

we may be affected by acts of terrorism war or risk of war – our rail lines facilities and equipment including rail cars carrying hazardous materials could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks terrorist attacks or other similar events any government response thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in addition insurance premiums for some or all of our current coverages could increase dramatically or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future

as previously reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2019 an appellate hearing related to the us district court for the district of columbia’s denial of class certification for the rail shippers was held on september 28 2018 on august 16 2019 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit affirmed the decision of us district court denying class certification the certification denial only five plaintiffs remain in this multidistrict litigation mdl originally filed in 2007 which remains pending they are proceeding on a consolidated basis in the us district of columbia court before the honorable paul l friedman mdl i since the certification denial approximately 96 lawsuits have been filed in federal court based on claims identical to those alleged in the class certification case the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation consolidated these suits for pretrial proceedings in the us district of columbia district court before the honorable beryl a howell mdl ii 

as we reported in our current report on form 8k filed on june 10 2011 the railroad received a complaint filed in the us district court for the district of columbia on june 7 2011 by oxbow carbon  minerals llc and related entities oxbow the fuel surcharge antitrust claim remains and was stayed pending the decision on class certification discussed above as a result of the certification denial the parties continued to discovery and discovery is complete in this matter the parties do not anticipate dates for summary judgment or trial will be set in the oxbow matter until judge friedman rules on certain matters in the mdl i mentioned above 

we continue to deny the allegations that our fuel surcharge programs violate the antitrust laws or any other laws we believe that these lawsuits are without merit and we will vigorously defend our actions therefore we currently believe that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on any of our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

executive summary 

2020 results 

 coronavirus pandemic covid19 – 2020 was a year of great uncertainty as covid19 spread across the globe the pandemic caused a dramatic slowdown of the economy as government intervention forced closures and changed individual behaviors and businesses transformed their operations to protect the health and safety of their employees customers and communities the varying levels of mitigation across different industries had a significant impact on the demand to ship freight in certain market segments the most notable impact on our revenue was the temporary suspension of automotive production and the corollary effect it had on products used for auto manufacturing other reductions in production drove volume declines in a number of other markets as well the pandemic also disrupted supply chains between asia and the united states driving declines in intermodal shipments while second quarter was the hardest hit and volumes have improved sequentially from that quarter some market segments are still lagging as yearoveryear volumes are down 

 safety – the health and wellbeing of our employees was top of mind in 2020 as we navigated the continually changing environment due to covid19 we have and are continuing to adapt to protect the safety of our employees our customers and the communities we serve enhanced safety procedures were implemented across the system including new procedures and policies based on centers for disease control and prevention cdc guidelines 

we continued our focus on safety to reduce risk and eliminate incidents for our employees our customers and the public while we have implemented new practices which drove a 17 improvement in our reportable equipment incident rate per million train miles we have significant opportunity for improvement remaining our reportable personal injury incidents per 200000 employeehours of 090 was flat with last year we continued to use total safety culture courage to care and commit coaching observing mentoring and motivating with integrity and trust throughout our operations we remained focused on identifying and managing risks and training our employees as their work environment changes 

 network operations – while the pandemic resulted in significant swings in volume we were able to adjust our demanddriven resources to reflect these fluctuations with minimal disruptions to our customers both our intermodal and manifestautomotive car trip plan compliance improved 6 points in 2020 showing our dedication to providing the customer with a service product that delivers value although the environment we operated in changed due to covid19 we continued our operational transformation this was evident as o ur key performance indicators have improved substantially yearoveryear transportation plan changes to eliminate switches and improved terminal processes drove an 8 improvement in freight car terminal dwell improved dwell coupled with 3 faster average train speed led to a 6 improvement in freight car velocity we also saw 14 improvement in locomotive productivity and 11 improvement in work force productivity additional detail on these metrics are discussed in other operating  performance and financial statistics of this item 7 

 freight revenues – our freight revenues decreased 10 yearoveryear to 183 billion driven by a volume decline of 7 lower fuel surcharge revenue and negative mix of traffic for example a relative 

increase in intermodal shipments which have a lower average revenue per car arc partially offset by core pricing gains volume declined in almost every market segment due to the deteriorating economic conditions brought on by the covid19 pandemic while some markets rebounded in the last half of the year particularly grain and intermodal others still lagged 2019 levels shipments of coal sand and petroleum products continue to be negatively impacted by the low crude oil and natural gas prices 

 financial results – in 2020 we generated operating income of 78 billion 8 below 2019 driven by the impacts of covid19 and a noncash impairment charge of 278 million related to our brazos yard investment productivity initiatives lower volumes and lower fuel prices drove operating expenses down 11 from 2019 these factors coupled with improved pricing were not enough to offset the impact of the revenue decline net income of 53 billion translated into earnings of 788 per diluted share down 6 from last year despite the adversity from covid19 our operational transformation produced an alltime record 599 operating ratio improving 07 points from 2019 

 fuel prices – our average price of diesel fuel in 2020 was 150 per gallon a decrease of 30 from 2019 the lower price resulted in lower operating expenses of 539 million excluding any impact from yearoveryear volume declines gross tonmiles decreased 9 and our fuel consumption rate computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross tonmiles improved 2 both driving lower fuel expense 

 liquidity – we are continually evaluating the impact of covid19 on our financial condition and liquidity on december 31 2020 we had 18 billion of cash and cash equivalents despite the pandemic we generated 85 billion of cash from operating activities yielding free cash flow of 32 billion after reductions of 27 billion for cash used in investing activities and 26 billion in dividends even though our share repurchase program was temporarily paused for six months starting in march 2020 we repurchased 37 billion of our shares we have been and we expect to continue to be in compliance with our debt covenants we have 20 billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility up to 800 million undrawn on our receivables facility and three bilateral revolving credit lines which mature in may 2021 with up to 600 million of available credit as of december 31 2020 none of the revolving credit facility receivables facility or bilateral revolving credit lines was drawn 

free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid free cash flow is not considered a financial measure under gaap by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe free cash flow is important to management and investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financing free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for cash provided by operating activities the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities gaap measure to free cash flow nongaap measure 



2021 outlook 

 safety – operating a safe railroad benefits all our constituents our employees customers shareholders and the communities we serve we will continue using a multifaceted approach to safety utilizing technology risk assessments training employee engagement quality control and targeted capital investments we will continue using and expanding the deployment of total safety culture courage to care commit and peer to peer throughout our operations which allows us to identify and implement best practices for employee and operational safety we formed an operating practices command center to identify causes of mainline service interruptions and develop solutions in addition to assisting employees with understanding policies procedures and best practices for handling trains we will continue our efforts to utilize data to identify and mitigate risk detect rail defects improve or close crossings and educate the public and law enforcement agencies about crossing safety through 

a combination of our own programs including risk assessment strategies industry programs and local community activities across the network 

 network operations – in 2021 we will continue to transform our railroad to further increase reliability of our service product reduce variability in network operations and improve resource utilization continued implementation of train length initiatives will allow us to add incremental volume growth to our existing train network we will continue to make structural changes to improve operational performance and efficiency a more efficient network requires fewer locomotives freight cars and other resources 

 market conditions – we expect uncertainties with covid19 and the economy to continue in 2021 how governments and consumers react to the resurgence mutation of the virus and distribution of the vaccine could result in or contribute to customer disruptions an elongated recovery period or a downturn from our current business levels disruptions in our customers’ supply chains caused by the pandemic or other factors may have an impact on our shipments in addition other factors such as natural gas prices weather conditions and demand for other energy sources may impact the coal market crude oil price spreads may drive demand for petroleum products and drilling materials available truck capacity could impact our intermodal business and international trade agreements could promote or hinder trade 

 fuel prices – projections for crude oil and natural gas continue to fluctuate in the current environment we again could see volatile fuel prices during the year as they are sensitive to global and us domestic demand refining capacity geopolitical events weather conditions and other factors as prices fluctuate there will be a timing impact on earnings as our fuel surcharge programs trail increases or decreases in fuel price by approximately two months 

significant changes in fuel prices could have an impact on the amount of consumer discretionary spending impacting demand for various consumer products we transport alternatively those changes could have an inverse impact on commodities such as coal petroleum products and domestic drillingrelated shipments 

 capital plan – in 2021 we expect our capital plan to be approximately 29 billion essentially flat with 2020 implementation of our new transportation plan has generated capacity we will continue to harden our infrastructure replace older assets and improve the safety and resilience of the network in addition the plan includes investments intended to support growth and improve productivity and operational efficiency the capital plan may be revised if business conditions warrant or if new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments see further discussion in this item 7 under liquidity and capital resources – capital plan 

 financial expectations – we expect volume to be up four to as high as six percent in 2021 compared to 2020 provided the second half of the year’s industrial production strengthens as predicted by economists in the current environment we expect continued margin improvement driven by pricing opportunities in excess of inflation and ongoing productivity initiatives resulting in approximately 500 million of productivity savings while better leveraging our resources and strengthening our franchise we expect to generate strong cash from operating activities along with maintaining our dividend and share repurchase program as the continued effect of covid19 is still uncertain it could have a material impact on our 2021 financial and operating results but our focus will be on what we can manage such as increasing productivity seeking new business opportunities protecting our employees customers and communities and providing excellent service to our customers ‎ 

results of operations 

operating revenues 



we generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our three commodity groups prior to 2020 we reported on four commodity groups thus prior years’ freight revenue average revenue per car arc and carloadings have been realigned to the new reporting format freight revenues vary with volume carloads and arc changes in price traffic mix and fuel surcharges drive arc customer incentives which are primarily provided for shipping tofrom specific locations or based on cumulative volumes are recorded as a reduction to operating revenues customer incentives that include variable consideration based on cumulative volumes are estimated using the expected value method which is based on available historical current and forecasted volumes and recognized as the related performance obligation is satisfied we recognize freight revenues over time as shipments move from origin to destination the allocation of revenue between reporting periods is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred 

other revenues consist primarily of revenues earned by our other subsidiaries primarily logistics and commuter rail operations and accessorial revenues other subsidiary revenues are generally recognized over time as shipments move from origin to destination the allocation of revenue between reporting periods is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred accessorial revenues are recognized at a point in time as performance obligations are satisfied 

freight revenues decreased 10 yearoveryear to 183 billion driven by a 7 volume decline lower fuel surcharge and negative mix of traffic partially offset by core pricing gains volume declined in almost every market segment due to the deteriorating economic conditions brought on by the covid19 pandemic while some markets rebounded in the fourth quarter particularly grain and intermodal others still lagged 2019 levels shipments of coal sand and petroleum products continue to be negatively impacted by low crude oil and natural gas prices 

our fuel surcharge programs generated freight revenues of almost 10 billion and 16 billion in 2020 and 2019 respectively fuel surcharge revenue in 2020 decreased 586 million as a result of a 30 decrease in fuel price and a 7 reduction in carloadings partially offset by the lag impact on fuel surcharge it can generally take up to two months for changing fuel prices to affect fuel surcharges recoveries 

in 2020 other subsidiary revenues decreased from 2019 driven by the disruption of the automotive supply chain which drove lower intermodal shipments and revenue at our subsidiaries that broker intermodal and transload logistics services accessorial revenue and other revenue declined driven by lower industrial products traffic 

the following tables summarize the yearoveryear changes in freight revenues revenue carloads and arc by commodity type 







a for intermodal shipments each container or trailer equals one carload 



mexico business – each of our commodity groups includes revenue from shipments to and from mexico revenue from mexico business was 21 billion in 2020 down 10 compared to 2019 driven by a 12 decline in volume and lower fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by core pricing gains the volume decline was driven by the covid19 pandemic with declines in automotive and intermodal shipments partially offset by increases in lpg  beer and grain 

operating expenses 





compensation and benefits – compensation and benefits include wages payroll taxes health and welfare costs pension costs other postretirement benefits and incentive costs in 2020 expenses decreased 12 compared to 2019 due to productivity initiatives declines in carload volumes lower weatherrelated costs management’s actions responding to the sharp decline in volume including three months of temporary unpaid leave and salary reductions and almost 6 months of large shop closures a locomotive shop a freight car shop and a maintenanceofway shop partially offset by wage inflation an employment tax refund recognized in 2019 and a onetime bonus payment for agreement employees who worked during the pandemic severance costs were relatively flat yearoveryear 

depreciation – the majority of depreciation relates to road property including rail ties ballast and other track material depreciation expense was essentially flat in 2020 compared to 2019 

purchased services and materials – expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors and other service providers including equipment maintenance and contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services materials used to maintain the railroad’s lines structures and equipment costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other railroads transportation and lodging for train crew employees trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers leased automobile maintenance expenses and tools and supplies purchased services and materials decreased 13 in 2020 compared to 2019 driven by reductions in all of the following locomotive maintenance expenses due to a smaller active fleet volumerelated costs for intermodal and transload services incurred by our subsidiaries costs for transportation for the train crews professional services expense costs associated with derailments and yearoveryear weatherrelated costs 

fuel – fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and nonhighway vehicles and heavy equipment locomotive diesel fuel prices which averaged 150 per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in 2020 compared to 213 per gallon in 2019 decreased expenses 539 million excluding any impact from yearoveryear volume declines gross tonmiles decreased 9 and our fuel consumption rate computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross tonmiles improved 2 which both drove lower fuel expense 

equipment and other rents – equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies freight car intermodal and locomotive leases and office and other rent expenses offset by e quity income from certain equity method investments equipment and other rents expense decreased 11 compared to 2019 driven by improved freight car velocity volume declines and lease returns partially offset by lower equity income 

other – other expenses include state and local taxes freight equipment and property damage utilities insurance personal injury environmental employee travel telephone and cellular computer software bad debt and other general expenses other expenses increased 27 in 2020 compared to 2019 as a result of a 278 million noncash impairment charge related to our brazos yard investment increased bad debt expense state and local taxes lower equity income from our investment in grupo ferroviaro mexicano and write offs of certain inprogress capital projects and lease impairments were almost completely offset by lower costs associated with freight loss and damage employee travel and destroyed equipment 

nonoperating items 



other income – other income increased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to larger gains from real estate sales including a 69 million gain from a land and permanent easement sale to the illinois state toll highway authority partially offset by 31 million in interest income associated with an employment tax refund in 2019 and lower interest income 

interest expense – interest expense increased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to an increased weightedaverage debt level of 279 billion in 2020 from 248 billion in 2019 partially offset by the impact of a lower effective interest rate of 41 in 2020 compared to 43  in 2019 

income taxes – income tax expense decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to lower pretax income our effective tax rates for 2020 and 2019 were 234 and 236 respectively

other operatingperformance and financial statistics 

we report a number of key performance measures weekly to the stb we provide this data on our website at wwwupcominvestoraarstbreportsindexhtm 

operatingperformance statistics 

management continuously measures these key operating metrics to evaluate our productivity asset utilization and network efficiency in striving to provide a consistent reliable service product to our customers 

railroad performance measures are included in the table below 



a prior years have been recast to conform to the current year presentation which reflects minor refinements 

b as reported to the stb 

gross and revenue tonmiles – gross tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled revenue tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles gross tonmiles and revenue tonmiles both decreased 9 in 2020 compared to 2019 driven by a 7 decline in carloadings changes in commodity mix drove the variance in yearoveryear decreases between gross tonmiles revenue tonmiles and carloads 

freight car velocity – freight car velocity measures the average daily miles per car on our network the two key drivers of this metric are the speed of the train between terminals average train speed and the time a rail car spends at the terminals average terminal dwell time continued implementation of our new operating plan was the primary driver of the improvement from 2019 as both average terminal dwell and average train speed improved compared to 2020 average terminal dwell time decreased compared to 2019 largely due to improved terminal processes transportation plan changes to eliminate switches and reduced carload volumes due to covid19 average train speed in 2020 improved as weatherrelated challenges slowed trains in the first half of 2019 train speed remained relatively flat yearoveryear in the second half of the year 

locomotive productivity – locomotive productivity is gross tonmiles per average daily locomotive horsepower locomotive productivity increased 14 in 2020 compared to 2019 driven by a 24 reduction in our average active fleet size due to transportation plan changes and lower locomotive dwell times 

train length – train length is the average maximum train length on a route measured in feet our train length increased 14 compared to 2019 as a result of blending service products transportation plan changes and completing 36 siding extension projects 

car trip plan compliance – car trip plan compliance is the percentage of cars delivered on time in accordance with our original trip plan our network trip plan compliance is broken into the intermodal and manifest products intermodal trip plan compliance improved versus 2019 due to improved train speed and reduced dwell at our origin and destination ramps manifest car trip plan compliance improved compared to 2019 due to improved car dwell in our yards increased train velocity across the network and more 

reliable first and last mile service both metrics were aided by reduced carload volumes due to covid19 and milder weather 

workforce productivity – workforce productivity is average daily car miles per employee workforce productivity improved 11 reaching an alltime record as average daily car miles decreased 9 while employees decreased 17 compared to 2019 lower volumes drove the decline in average daily car miles the 17 decline in employee levels was driven by productivity initiatives a 7 decline in carload volumes and a smaller capital workforce at the end of the year approximately 4100 employees across all crafts were furloughed 

operating ratio – operating ratio is our operating expenses reflected as a percentage of operating revenue our operating ratio of 599 was an alltime record and improved 07 points compared to 2019 mainly driven by productivity initiatives lower fuel prices and core pricing gains which were partially offset by a negative mix of traffic a onetime impairment charge inflation and other cost increases 

return on average common shareholders’ equity 



return on invested capital as adjusted roic 



roic is considered a nongaap financial measure by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our longterm capital investments in addition we currently use roic as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of equity compensation for our executives roic should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for other information provided in accordance with gaap the most comparable gaap measure is return on average common shareholders’ equity the tables above provide reconciliations from return on average common shareholders’ equity to roic at december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 the incremental borrowing rate on operating leases was 37 

adjusted debt  adjusted ebitda 



adjusted debt to adjusted ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and adjustments for other income and interest on present value of operating leases is considered a nongaap financial measure by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the company’s ability to sustain given debt levels including leases with the cash generated from operations in addition a comparable measure is used by rating agencies when reviewing the company’s credit rating adjusted debt to adjusted ebitda should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for net income the table above provides reconciliations from net income to adjusted debt to adjusted ebitda at december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 the incremental borrowing rate on operating leases was 37 

liquidity and capital resources 

we are continually evaluating the impact of covid19 on our financial condition and liquidity although the situation is fluid and highly uncertain we continue to analyze a wide range of economic scenarios and the impact on our ability to generate cash these analyses inform our liquidity plans and activity outlined below and indicate we have sufficient capacity to sustain an extended period of lower volumes 

at december 31 2020 we had a working capital surplus due to an increased cash balance held due to the uncertainty related to covid19 compared to december 31 2019 where we had a working capital deficit due to upcoming debt maturities as past years indicate it is not unusual for us to have a working capital deficit however we believe it is not an indication of a lack of liquidity we also maintain adequate resources including our credit facility and when necessary access the capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements 

we generated 85 billion of cash from operating activities in 2020 based on the strength of our cash position we completed a 10 billion debt exchange redeemed the 500 million principal outstanding of 40 notes due february 1 2021 on november 1 2020 repaid the 300 million outstanding bilateral revolving credit lines that we assumed earlier in the year repaid the 400 million outstanding on the receivables facility and reduced our commercial paper outstanding from 200 million to 75 million we have been and we expect to continue to be in compliance with our debt covenants our bad debt provision was adjusted to reflect deteriorations of customers’ creditworthiness we maintained the dividend during 2020 paying out 26 billion and repurchased shares totaling 37 billion in the third quarter we completed our 2 billion accelerated share repurchase program entered into on february 18 2020 and resumed share repurchases in the fourth quarter after suspending share repurchases in march 2020 

our principal sources of liquidity include cash cash equivalents our receivables securitization facility our revolving credit facility as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing 

through the capital markets on december 31 2020 we had 18 billion of cash and cash equivalents 20 billion of committed credit available under our credit facility up to 800 million undrawn on the receivables facility and three bilateral revolving credit lines which mature in may 2021 with up to 600 million of available credit as of december 31 2020 none of the revolving credit facility receivables facility or bilateral revolving credit lines was drawn we did not draw on our revolving credit facility at any time during 2020 our access to the receivables securitization facility may be reduced or restricted if our bond ratings fall to certain levels below investment grade if our bond rating were to deteriorate it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financing is dependent on market conditions deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability we expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity through any or all of the following sources or activities i increasing the utilization of our receivables securitization ii issuing commercial paper iii entering into bank loans outside of our revolving credit facility or iv issuing bonds or other debt securities to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets the company’s 20 billion revolving credit facility is intended to support the issuance of commercial paper by upc and also serves as an additional source of liquidity to fund short term needs the company currently does not intend to make any borrowings under this facility 

libor transition – each of our 20 billion revolving credit facility three bilateral revolving credit lines two term loans and receivables securitization facility currently use libor as the benchmark for its floating interest rates authorities that regulate libor have announced plans to phase out libor so that it will at some point cease to exist as a benchmark for floating interest rates to address the phase out of libor the agreements for substantially all of these facilities include a mechanism to replace libor with an alternative rate or benchmark under specified circumstances through an amendment to the agreements as part of this process we will need to renegotiate our agreements to reference that alternative rate or benchmark and may need to modify our existing benchmark replacement language or obtain replacement facilities and the use of an alternative rate or benchmark may negatively impact the terms of our facilities including in the form of an adverse effect on interest rates and higher borrowing costs and interest expense 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to lower net income partially offset by a deferral of employment tax payments allowed by a provision in the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act 

cash flow conversion – cash flow conversion is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in capital investments as a ratio of net income 

cash flow conversion rate is not considered a financial measure under gaap by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe cash flow conversion rate is important to management and investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financing cash flow conversion rate should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for cash provided by operating activities 

the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities gaap measure to cash flow conversion rate nongaap measure 



investing activities 

cash used in investing activities in 2020 decreased compared to 2019 primarily driven by reduced capital investment in locomotives and freight cars and increased real estate sales 

the following tables detail cash capital investments and track statistics for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



a other includes bridges and tunnels signals other road assets and road work equipment 

b locomotives and freight cars include early lease buyouts of 38 million in 2020 290 million in 2019 and 290 million in 2018 



capital plan – in 2021 we expect our capital plan to be approximately 29 billion essentially flat with 2020 while implementation of our new transportation plan has generated capacity we will continue to harden our infrastructure replace older assets and improve the safety and resiliency of the network in addition the plan includes investments intended to support growth and improve productivity and operational efficiency the capital plan may be revised if business conditions warrant or if new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments 

  

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 driven by lower share repurchases which were paused in march of 2020 due to the uncertainty of covid19 and resumed in the fourth quarter of 2020 with the exception of the final settlement in july 2020 of our 2 billion accelerated share repurchase program entered into on february 18 2020 this decrease was partially offset by an increase in debt repaid 

see note 14 of the consolidated financial statements for a description of all our outstanding financing arrangements and significant new borrowings 

share repurchase programs 

effective april 1 2019 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 150 million shares of our common stock by march 31 2022 replacing our previous repurchase program these repurchases may be made on the open market or through other transactions our management has sole discretion with respect to determining the timing and amount of these transactions as of december 31 2020 we repurchased a total of 409 billion of our common stock since commencement of our repurchase programs in 2007 the table below represents shares repurchased under repurchase programs during 2020 and 2019 



a in the period of the final settlement the average price paid under the accelerated share repurchase programs is calculated based on the total program value less the value assigned to the initial delivery of shares the average price of the completed 2020 and 2019 accelerated share repurchase programs was 15586 and 16701 respectively 

b includes 8786380 and 11795930 shares repurchased in february 2020 and 2019 respectively under accelerated share repurchase programs 

c includes an incremental 4045575 and 3172900 shares received upon final settlement in july 2020 and august 2019 respectively under accelerated share repurchase programs 

managements assessments of market conditions and other pertinent factors guide the timing and volume of all repurchases we expect to fund any share repurchases under this program through cash generated from operations the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties debt issuances and cash on hand open market repurchases are recorded in treasury stock at cost which includes any applicable commissions and fees 

from january 1 2021 through february 4 2021 we repurchased 21 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately 442 million 

accelerated share repurchase programs – the company has established accelerated share repurchase programs asrs with financial institutions to repurchase shares of our common stock these asrs have been structured so that at the time of commencement we pay a specified amount to the financial institutions and receive an initial delivery of shares additional shares may be received at the time of settlement the final number of shares to be received is based on the volume weighted average price of the company’s common stock during the asr term less a discount and subject to potential adjustments pursuant to the terms of such asr 

on february 19 2020 the company received 8786380 shares of its common stock repurchased under asrs for an aggregate of 20 billion upon settlement of these asrs in the third quarter of 2020 we received 4045575 additional shares 

on february 26 2019 the company received 11795930 shares of its common stock repurchased under asrs for an aggregate of 25 billion upon settlement of these asrs in the third quarter of 2019 we received 3172900 additional shares 

asrs are accounted for as equity transactions and at the time of receipt shares are included in treasury stock at fair market value as of the corresponding initiation or settlement date the company reflects shares received as a repurchase of common stock in the weighted average common shares outstanding calculation for basic and diluted earnings per share 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and as referenced in the tables below we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments including material sources of offbalance sheet and structured finance arrangements other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets as described in item 1a of part ii of this report there is no known trend demand commitment event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition our commercial obligations financings and commitments are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations particularly within the transportation industry 

the following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of december 31 2020 



a excludes finance lease obligations of 449 million as well as unamortized discount and deferred issuance costs of 1538 million includes an interest component of 20707 million 

b purchase obligations include locomotive maintenance contracts purchase commitments for fuel purchases ties ballast and rail and agreements to purchase other goods and services 

c includes leases for locomotives freight cars other equipment and real estate 

d represents total obligations including interest component of 68 million 

e includes estimated other post retirement medical and life insurance payments and payments made under the unfunded pension plan for the next ten years 

f future cash flows for income tax contingencies reflect the recorded liabilities and assets for unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties as of december 31 2020 for amounts where the year of settlement is uncertain they are reflected in the other column 



a none of the credit facility was used as of december 31 2020 

b none of the receivables securitization facility was utilized as of december 31 2020 the full program matures in july 2022 

c none of the bilateral revolving credit lines were utilized as of december 31 2020 the programs mature in may 2021 

d none of the letters of credit were drawn upon as of december 31 2020 

e includes guaranteed obligations related to our affiliated operations 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

guarantees – at december 31 2020 and 2019 we were contingently liable for 10 million and 15 million respectively in guarantees the fair value of these obligations as of both december 31 2020 and 2019 was 0 we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business and they include guaranteed obligations related to our affiliated operations the final guarantee expires in 2022 we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees we do not expect 

that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

other matters 

labor agreements – approximately 83 of our fulltime employees are represented by 13 major rail unions pursuant to the railway labor act rla our collective bargaining agreements are subject to modification every five years existing agreements remain in effect until new agreements are ratified or until the rla procedures are exhausted the rla procedures include mediation potential arbitration coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential emergency boards and congressional intervention the current round of negotiations began on january 1 2020 related to years 20202024 contract negotiations historically continue for an extended period of time and work stoppages during negotiations are rare see “ strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations ” in the risk factors in item 1a of this report 

inflation – long periods of inflation significantly increase asset replacement costs for capitalintensive companies as a result assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels depreciation charges on an inflationadjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 

sensitivity analyses – the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 

at december 31 2020 we had variablerate debt representing approximately 12 of our total debt if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2021 than our december 31 2020 variable rate which was approximately 13 our interest expense would increase by approximately 33 million this amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balances of our variablerate debt at december 31 2020 

market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2020 and amounts to an increase of approximately 47 billion to the fair value of our debt at december 31 2020 we estimated the fair values of our fixedrate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 

accounting pronouncements – see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

asserted and unasserted claims – various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries we cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity to the extent possible we have recorded a liability where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated we do not expect that any known lawsuits claims environmental costs commitments contingent liabilities or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters 

indemnities – our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements including certain tax indemnifications can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions 

climate change – although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item 1a of this report we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact however we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment including investments in new technologies using training programs and technology to reduce fuel consumption and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency 

cr itical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 2 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 these critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 

personal injury – the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability including unasserted claims the federal employers’ liability act fela governs compensation for workrelated accidents under fela damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or outofcourt settlements we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 

our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments approximately 94 of the recorded liability is related to asserted claims and approximately 6 is related to unasserted claims at december 31 2020 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 270 million to 295 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation 

our personal injury liability activity was as follows 



our personal injury claims activity was as follows 



we reassess our estimated insurance recoveries annually and have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2020 and 2019 any changes to recorded insurance recoveries are included in the above table in the changes in estimates for prior years category 

environmental costs – we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations we have identified 373 sites where we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements this includes 29 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government 18 of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 

when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in our business we perform with assistance of our consultants environmental assessments on the property we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated our environmental liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments 

our environmental liability activity was as follows 



our environmental site activity was as follows 



the environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties cost estimates are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and existing technology laws and regulations the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties sitespecific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal state and local laws governing environmental remediation current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

property and depreciation – our railroad operations are highly capital intensive and our large base of homogeneous networktype assets turns over on a continuous basis each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enables us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated service lives which are measured in years except for rail in highdensity traffic corridors ie all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment and yard and switching tracks for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics use and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources not as singular items we currently have more than 60 depreciable asset classes and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology asset strategies or other factors 

we determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property by means of depreciation studies we perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets ie rail and other track material ties and ballast and other road property our depreciation studies take into account the following factors 

 statistical analysis of historical patterns of use and retirements of each of our asset classes 

 evaluation of any expected changes in current operations and the outlook for continued use of the assets 

 evaluation of technological advances and changes to maintenance practices and 

 expected salvage to be received upon retirement 

for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track it has been our experience that the lives of rail in highdensity traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage ie the amount of weight carried over the rail the service lives also vary based on rail weight rail condition eg new or secondhand and rail type eg straight or curve our depreciation studies for rail in highdensity traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross tonmiles carried over the rail ie the weight of loaded and empty freight cars locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile rail in highdensity traffic corridors accounts for approximately 70 percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material based on the number of gross tonmiles carried over our rail in high density traffic corridors during 2020 the estimated service lives of the majority of this rail ranged from approximately 24 years to approximately 48 years for all other depreciable assets we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively 

estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to changes in physical use technology asset strategies and other factors that will have an impact on the retirement profiles of our assets we are not aware of any specific factors that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service lives of our assets actual use and retirement of our assets may vary from our current estimates which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future periods 

changes in estimated useful lives of our assets due to the results of our depreciation studies could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately 68 million if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were decreased by one year annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately 72 million our 2020 depreciation studies have resulted in lower depreciation rates for some asset classes t hese lower rates offset the impact of a projected higher depreciable asset base resulting in a flat yearoveryear total depreciation expense in 2021 versus 2020  

under group depreciation the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated by multiplying the current replacement cost of track assets by a historical index factor derived from i inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ii the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate in addition we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies any deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets 

for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions i it is unusual ii it is material in amount and iii it varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies during the last three fiscal years no gains or losses were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad properties a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations 

we review construction in progress assets that have not yet been placed into service for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset or assets may not be recoverable if impairment indicators are present and the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of construction in progress assets when grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value 

income taxes – we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have 

been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns these expected future tax consequences are measured based on current tax law the effects of future tax legislation are not anticipated future tax legislation such as a change in the corporate tax rate could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity for example a permanent 1 increase in future income tax rates would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately 521 million similarly a permanent 1 decrease in future income tax rates would decrease our deferred tax liability by approximately 521 million 

when appropriate we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reflect that these tax assets may not be realized in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized based on management’s judgments using available evidence for purposes of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize a deferred tax asset in 2020 and 2019 there were no valuation allowances 

we recognize tax benefits that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement a liability for “unrecognized tax benefits” is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards 

pension and other postretirement benefits – we use an actuarial analysis to measure the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and medical and life insurance benefits opeb to eligible employees in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make several assumptions the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rates and expected rate of return on pension assets for opeb the critical assumptions are the discount rates and health care cost trend rate 

we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually and selected assumptions are based on the following factors 

 we measure the service cost and interest cost components of our net periodic benefit cost by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year discount rates are based on a mercer yield curve of high quality corporate bonds rated aa by a recognized rating agency 

 expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return taking into consideration current and expected market conditions 

 health care cost trend rate is based on our historical rates of inflation and expected market conditions 

the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit for 2021 and the estimated impact on 2021 net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit relative to a change in those assumptions 





the following table presents the net periodic pension and opeb cost for the years ended december 31

ash ethanol and rock shipped in unit trains – trains transporting a single commodity from one origin to one destination manifest traffic includes individual carload or less than trainload business involving commodities such as lumber steel paper food and chemicals the transportation of finished vehicles auto parts intermodal containers and truck trailers are included as part of our premium business in 2019 we generated freight revenues totaling 202 billion from the following four commodity groups 

agricultural products – transportation of grains commodities produced from these grains fertilizer and food and beverage products generated 22 of the railroad’s 2019 freight revenue we access most major grain markets linking the midwest and western us producing areas to export terminals in the pacific northwest and gulf coast ports as well as mexico we also serve significant domestic markets including grain processors animal feeders and ethanol producers in the midwest and west fertilizer movements originate in the gulf coast region midwest western us and canada through interline access for delivery to major agricultural users in those areas as well as abroad 

energy – the company’s energy shipments are grouped into the following three categories i coal ii sand and iii petroleum liquid petroleum gases lpg and renewables in 2019 this group generated 18 of our freight revenue the railroad’s network supports the transportation of coal shipments to independent and regulated power companies and industrial facilities throughout the us through interchange gateways and ports uprr’s reach extends to eastern us utilities as well as to mexico and other international destinations coal traffic originating in the powder river basin prb area of wyoming is the largest segment of the railroad’s coal business demand for hydraulic fracturing sand or fracsand is generated by oil and gas drilling whereas the company’s petroleum and lpg shipments are primarily impacted by refinery utilization rates regional crude pricing differentials pipeline capacity and the use of asphalt for road programs renewable shipments consist primarily of biomass exports and wind turbine components 

industrial – our extensive network facilitates the movement of numerous commodities between thousands of origin and destination points throughout north america the industrial group consists of several categories including construction industrial chemicals plastics forest products specialized products primarily waste lime salt and government metals and ores and soda ash transportation of these products accounted for 29 of our freight revenue in 2019 commercial residential and governmental infrastructure investments drive shipments of steel aggregates cement and wood products industrial and light manufacturing plants receive steel nonferrous materials minerals and other raw materials 

the industrial chemicals market consists of a vast number of chemical compounds that support the manufacturing of more complex chemicals plastics shipments support automotive housing and the durable and disposable consumer goods markets  forest product shipments include lumber and paper commodities lumber shipments originate primarily in the pacific northwest or western canada and move throughout the us for use in new home construction and repairs and remodeling paper shipments primarily support packaging needs oil and gas drilling generates demand for raw steel finished pipe stone and drilling fluid commodities soda ash originates in southwestern wyoming and california destined for chemical and glass producing markets in north america and abroad 

premium – in 2019 the premium franchise generated 31 of union pacific’s total freight revenue our premium franchise includes three segments international intermodal domestic intermodal and finished vehicles international business consists of import and export traffic moving in 20 or 40foot shipping containers that mainly passes through west coast ports served by up’s extensive terminal network domestic business includes container and trailer traffic picked up and delivered within north america for intermodal marketing companies primarily shipper agents and logistics companies as well as truckload carriers 

we are the largest automotive carrier west of the mississippi river and operate or access 38 vehicle distribution centers the railroad’s extensive franchise serves five vehicle assembly plants and connects to west coast ports all six major mexico gateways and the port of houston to accommodate both import and export shipments in addition to transporting finished vehicles uprr provides expedited handling of automotive parts in both boxcars and intermodal containers destined for mexico the us and canada 

seasonality – some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons reflecting either or both the nature of the commodity and the demand cycle for the commodity such as certain agricultural and food products that have specific growing and harvesting seasons the peak shipping seasons for these commodities can vary considerably each year depending upon various factors including the strength of domestic and international economies and currencies and the strength of harvests and market prices for agricultural products 

working capital – at both december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 we had a working capital deficit the deficits are primarily due to upcoming debt maturities as past years indicate it is not unusual for us to have a working capital deficit however we believe it is not an indication of a lack of liquidity we also maintain adequate resources including our credit facility and when necessary access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements 

competition – we are subject to competition from other railroads motor carriers ship and barge operators and pipelines our main railroad competitor is burlington northern santa fe llc its primary subsidiary bnsf railway company bnsf operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors in addition we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers motor carrier competition exists for all four of our commodity groups excluding most coal shipments because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and gulf coast waterways barges can be particularly competitive especially for grain and bulk commodities in certain areas where we operate in addition to price competition we also face competition with respect to transit times quality and reliability of service from motor carriers and other railroads motor carriers in particular can have an advantage over railroads with respect to transit times and timeliness of service however railroads are much more fuelefficient than trucks which reduces the impact of transporting goods on the environment and public infrastructure and we have been making efforts to convert certain truck traffic to rail additionally we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any of the following could also affect the competitiveness of our transportation services for some or all of our commodities i improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation ii legislation that eliminates or significantly increases the size or weight limitations applied to motor carriers or iii legislation or regulatory changes that impose operating restrictions on railroads or that adversely affect the profitability of some or all railroad traffic finally many movements face product or geographic competition where our customers can use different products eg natural gas instead of coal sorghum instead of corn or commodities from different locations eg grain from states or countries that we do not serve crude oil from different regions sourcing different commodities or different locations allows shippers to substitute different carriers and such competition may reduce our volume or constrain prices for more information regarding risks we face from competition see the risk factors in item 1a of this report 

key suppliers – we depend on two key domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives due to the capital intensive nature of the locomotive manufacturing business and sophistication of this equipment potential new suppliers face high barriers of entry into this industry therefore if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives supplying parts or providing maintenance for any reason including insolvency or bankruptcy we could experience a significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations additionally for a high percentage of our rail purchases we utilize two steel producers one domestic and one international that meet our specifications rail is critical for maintenance replacement improvement and expansion of our network and facilities rail manufacturing also has high barriers of entry and if one of those suppliers 

discontinues operations for any reason including insolvency or bankruptcy we could experience cost increases and difficulty obtaining rail 

employees – approximately 85 of our fulltime employees are represented by 14 major rail unions pursuant to the railway labor act rla our collective bargaining agreements are subject to modification every five years the rla procedures include mediation potential arbitration coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential emergency boards and congressional intervention the current round of negotiations began on january 1 2020 related to years 20202024 contract negotiations historically continue for an extended period of time and work stoppages during negotiations are rare 

railroad security – our security efforts consist of a wide variety of measures including employee training engagement with our customers training of emergency responders and partnerships with numerous federal state and local government agencies while federal law requires us to protect the confidentiality of our security plans designed to safeguard against terrorism and other security incidents the following provides a general overview of our security initiatives 

uprr security measures – we maintain a comprehensive security plan designed to both deter and respond to any potential or actual threats as they arise the plan includes four levels of alert status each with its own set of countermeasures we employ our own police force consisting of commissioned and highlytrained officers our employees also undergo recurrent security and preparedness training as well as federallymandated hazardous materials and security training we regularly review the sufficiency of our employee training programs we maintain the capability to move critical operations to backup facilities in different locations 

we operate an emergency response management center 24 hours a day the center receives reports of emergencies dangerous or potentially dangerous conditions and other safety and security issues from our employees the public law enforcement and other government officials in cooperation with government officials we monitor both threats and public events and as necessary we may alter rail traffic flow at times of concern to minimize risk to communities and our operations we comply with the hazardous materials routing rules and other requirements imposed by federal law we also design our operating plan to expedite the movement of hazardous material shipments to minimize the time rail cars remain idle at yards and terminals located in or near major population centers additionally in compliance with transportation security agency regulations we deployed information systems and instructed employees in tracking and documenting the handoff of rail security sensitive materials with customers and interchange partners 

we also have established a number of our own innovative safety and securityoriented initiatives ranging from various investments in technology to the officer on train program which provides local law enforcement officers with the opportunity to ride with train crews to enhance their understanding of railroad operations and risks our staff of information security professionals continually assesses cyber security risks and implements mitigation programs that evolve with the changing technology threat environment to date we have not experienced any material disruption of our operations due to a cyber threat or attack directed at us 

cooperation with federal state and local government agencies – we work closely on physical and cyber security initiatives with government agencies including the us department of transportation dot and the department of homeland security dhs as well as local police departments fire departments and other first responders in conjunction with the association of american railroads aar we sponsor ask rail a mobile application which provides first responders with secure links to electronic information including commodity and emergency response information required by emergency personnel to respond to accidents and other situations we also participate in the national joint terrorism task force a multiagency effort established by the us department of justice and the federal bureau of investigation to combat and prevent terrorism 

we work with the coast guard us customs and border protection cbp and the military transport management command which monitor shipments entering the uprr rail network at us border crossings and ports we were the first railroad in the us to be named a partner in cbp’s customstrade partnership against terrorism a partnership designed to develop enhance and maintain effective security processes throughout the global supply chain 

‎ 

cooperation with customers and trade associations – through transcaer transportation community awareness and emergency response we work with the aar the american chemistry council the american petroleum institute and other chemical trade groups to provide communities with preparedness tools including the training of emergency responders in cooperation with the federal railroad administration fra and other interested groups we are also working to develop additional improvements to tank car design that will further limit the risk of releases of hazardous materials 

governmental and environmental regulation 

governmental regulation – our operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local regulations generally applicable to all businesses see also the discussion of certain regulatory proceedings in legal proceedings item 3 

the operations of the railroad are also subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board stb the stb has jurisdiction over rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic common carrier service of regulated traffic freight car compensation transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines and acquisition of control of rail common carriers the stb continues its efforts to explore expanding rail regulation and is reviewing proposed rulemaking in various areas including reciprocal switching commodity exemptions and expanding and easing procedures for smaller rate complaints the stb also continues to develop a methodology for determining railroad revenue adequacy and the possible use of a revenue adequacy constraint in regulating railroad rates the stb posts quarterly reports on rate reasonableness cases and maintains a database on service complaints and has the authority to initiate investigations among other things 

the operations of the railroad also are subject to the regulations of the fra and other federal and state agencies in 2010 the fra issued initial rules governing installation of positive train control ptc ptc is a collision avoidance technology intended to override engineer controlled locomotives and stop traintotrain and overspeed accidents misaligned switch derailments and unauthorized entry to work zones the surface transportation extension act of 2015 amended the rail safety improvement act to require implementation of ptc by the end of 2018 which deadline may be extended to december 31 2020 provided certain other criteria are satisfied on december 10 2018 we received fra approval for an alternative schedule to implement test and refine our ptc during 20192020 as of december 31 2019 ptc has been implemented and installed on 100 percent of our required rail lines including required passenger train routes and interoperability efforts with other railroads will continue through 2020 through 2019 we have invested approximately 29 billion in the ongoing development of ptc final implementation of ptc will require us to adapt and integrate our system with other railroads whose implementation plan may be different than ours 

dot the occupational safety and health administration the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration and dhs along with other federal agencies have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety movement of hazardous materials and hazardous waste emissions requirements and equipment standards additionally various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law  

environmental regulation – we are subject to extensive federal and state environmental statutes and regulations pertaining to public health and the environment the statutes and regulations are administered and monitored by the environmental protection agency epa and by various state environmental agencies the primary laws affecting our operations are the resource conservation and recovery act regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act regulating the cleanup of contaminated properties the clean air act regulating air emissions and the clean water act regulating waste water discharges

 i tem 1a risk factors 

the following discussion addresses significant factors events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky and provides important information for the understanding of our “forwardlooking statements” which are discussed immediately preceding item 7a of this form 10k and elsewhere the risk factors set forth in this item 1a should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this report including management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item 7 and financial statements and supplementary data item 8 

we urge you to consider carefully the factors described below and the risks that they present for our operations as well as the risks addressed in other reports and materials that we file with the sec and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k when the factors events and contingencies described below or elsewhere in this form 10k materialize our business reputation financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects can be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of you investment additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations cash flows and prospects 

we must manage fluctuating demand for our services and network capacity – if there are significant reductions in demand for rail services with respect to one or more commodities or changes in consumer preferences that affect the businesses of our customers we may experience increased costs associated with resizing our operations including higher unit operating costs and costs for the storage of locomotives rail cars and other equipment workforce adjustments and other related activities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity if there is significant demand for our services that exceeds the designed capacity of our network we may experience network difficulties including congestion and reduced velocity that could compromise the level of service we provide to our customers this level of demand may also compound the impact of weather and weatherrelated events on our operations and velocity although we continue to improve our transportation plan add capacity improve operations at our yards and other facilities and improve our ability to address surges in demand for any reason with adequate resources we cannot be sure that these measures will fully or adequately address any service shortcomings resulting from demand exceeding our planned capacity we may experience other operational or service difficulties related to network capacity dramatic and unplanned fluctuations in our customers’ demand for rail service with respect to one or more commodities or operating regions or other events that could negatively impact our operational efficiency any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we transport hazardous materials – we transport certain hazardous materials and other materials including crude oil ethanol and toxic inhalation hazard tih materials such as chlorine that pose certain risks in the event of a release or combustion additionally us laws impose common carrier obligations on railroads that require us to transport certain hazardous materials regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss a rail accident or other incident or accident on our network at our facilities or at the facilities of our customers involving the release or combustion of hazardous materials could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury property damage and environmental penalties and remediation in excess of our insurance coverage for these risks which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to significant governmental regulation – we are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal state and local authorities covering a variety of health safety labor environmental economic as discussed below and other matters many laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses permits and other authorizations and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us governments or regulators may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate without providing us any recourse to address any adverse effects on our business including without limitation regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution increasing the amount of our traffic subject to common carrier regulation business relationships with other railroads calculation of our cost of capital or other inputs relevant to computing our revenue adequacy the prices we charge and costs and expenses significant legislative activity in congress or regulatory activity by the stb could expand regulation of railroad operations and prices for rail services which could reduce capital spending on our rail network facilities and equipment and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity for example enacted federal legislation mandated the implementation of ptc by december 31 2020 although we have completed implementation on all 

required rail lines final implementation of ptc will require us to adapt and integrate our system with other railroads whose implementation plan may be different than ours this implementation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition additionally one or more consolidations of class i railroads could also lead to increased regulation of the rail industry 

we are affected by general economic conditions – prolonged severe adverse domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of financial and credit markets may affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry and may have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity and our results of operations and financial condition 

we face competition from other railroads and other transportation providers – we face competition from other railroads motor carriers ships barges and pipelines in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system while trucks barges and maritime operators are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation or legislation that eliminates or significantly increases the size or weight limitations currently applicable to motor carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect the competitive environment in which we operate 

we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations – we rely on information technology in all aspects of our business including technology systems operated by us or under control of third parties if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if we are unable to develop or implement new technology such as ptc or the latest version of our transportation control systems we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to cybersecurity risks – we rely on information technology in all aspects of our business including technology systems operated by us or under control of third parties although we devote significant resources to protect our technology systems and proprietary data we have experienced and will continue to experience varying degrees of cyber incidents in the normal course of business while there can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect such incidents or attacks or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems after such incidents or attacks do occur we are continually evaluating attackers’ techniques and tactics and we are diligent in our monitoring training planning and prevention however breach or circumvention of our systems or the systems of third parties including by ransomware other cyber attacks or human error may result in significant service interruption safety failure other operational difficulties unauthorized access to or the loss of access to competitively sensitive confidential or other critical data or systems loss of customers financial losses regulatory fines and misuse or corruption of critical data and proprietary information any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures – as a railroad with operations in densely populated urban areas and other cities and a vast rail network we are exposed to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage environmental liability and other matters any material changes to litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving any or all of property damage personal injury and environmental liability that exceed our insurance coverage for such risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to significant environmental laws and regulations – due to the nature of the railroad business our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waters handling storage transportation disposal of waste and other materials and hazardous material or petroleum releases we generate and transport hazardous and nonhazardous waste in our operations and we did so in our former operations environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties leased properties and properties owned by third parties as well as to properties we currently own environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation we have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated or are strictly liable under these laws or regulations we currently have certain obligations at existing sites for investigation remediation and monitoring and we likely will have obligations at other sites in the future 

liabilities for these obligations affect our estimate based on our experience and as necessary the advice and assistance of our consultants however actual costs may vary from our estimates due to any or all of several factors including changes to environmental laws or interpretations of such laws technological changes affecting investigations and remediation the participation and financial viability of other parties responsible for any such liability and the corrective action or change to corrective actions required to remediate any existing or future sites we could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we may be affected by climate change and market or regulatory responses to climate change – climate change including the impact of global warming could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gasses including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating costs restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that a use commodities that we carry to produce energy b use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry or c manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels including chemical producers farmers and food producers and automakers and other manufacturers significant cost increases government regulation or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns including for example increasing royalties charged to producers of prb coal by the us department of interior and the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers finally we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change any of these factors individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures – as a railroad with a vast network we are exposed to severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods mudslides or landslides extreme temperatures and significant precipitation line outages and other interruptions caused by these conditions can adversely affect our entire rail network and can adversely affect revenue costs and liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity despite efforts we undertake to plan for these events 

strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations – the us class i railroads are party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions the majority of our employees belong to labor unions and are subject to these agreements disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in among other things strikes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts which could cause a significant disruption of our operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could compromise our service reliability or significantly increase our costs for health care wages and other benefits which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity labor disputes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts at loadingunloading facilities ports or other transport access points could compromise our service reliability and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity labor disputes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts by employees of our customers or our suppliers could compromise our service reliability and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

the availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations – changes in demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to meet demand for rail service unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

‎ 

we are affected by fluctuating fuel prices – fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses diesel fuel prices can be subject to dramatic fluctuations and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results although we currently are able to recover a significant amount of our fuel expenses from our customers through revenue from fuel surcharges we cannot be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elevated fuel costs through our fuel surcharges additionally future market conditions or legislative or regulatory activities could adversely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharges or adequately recover increased fuel costs through fuel surcharges as fuel prices fluctuate our fuel surcharge programs trail such fluctuations in fuel price by approximately two months and may be a significant source of quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear volatility particularly in periods of rapidly changing prices international political and economic factors events and conditions affect the volatility of fuel prices and supplies weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity a severe shortage of or disruption to domestic fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity alternatively lower fuel prices could have a positive impact on the economy by increasing consumer discretionary spending that potentially could increase demand for various consumer products we transport however lower fuel prices could have a negative impact on other commodities we transport such as coal and domestic drillingrelated shipments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we rely on capital markets – due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements we utilize longterm debt instruments bank financing and commercial paper from timetotime and we pledge certain of our receivables significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets including the credit markets or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to and significantly increase the cost of commercial paper and other financing sources including bank credit facilities and the issuance of longterm debt including corporate bonds a significant deterioration of our financial condition could result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade which could restrict or at certain credit levels below investment grade may prohibit us from utilizing our current receivables securitization facility this may also limit our access to external sources of capital and significantly increase the costs of short and longterm debt financing 

a significant portion of our revenue involves transportation of commodities to and from international markets – although revenues from our operations are attributable to transportation services provided in the us a significant portion of our revenues involves the transportation of commodities to and from international markets including mexico and southeast asia by various carriers and at times various modes of transportation significant and sustained interruptions of trade with mexico or countries in southeast asia including china could adversely affect customers and other entities that directly or indirectly purchase or rely on rail transportation services in the us as part of their operations and any such interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity any one or more of the following could cause a significant and sustained interruption of trade with mexico or countries in southeast asia a a deterioration of security for international trade and businesses b the adverse impact of new laws rules and regulations or the interpretation of laws rules and regulations by government entities courts or regulatory bodies including replacing the north american free trade agreement nafta with the ratification of the united statesmexicocanada agreement usmca and a “phase one” trade agreement with china c actions of taxing authorities that affect our customers doing business in foreign countries d any significant adverse economic developments such as extended periods of high inflation material disruptions in the banking sector or in the capital markets of these foreign countries and significant changes in the valuation of the currencies of these foreign countries that could materially affect the cost or value of imports or exports e shifts in patterns of international trade that adversely affect import and export markets f a material reduction in foreign direct investment in these countries and g public health crises including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease such as the novel coronavirus 

we are subject to legislative regulatory and legal developments involving taxes – taxes are a significant part of our expenses we are subject to us federal state and foreign income payroll property sales and use fuel and other types of taxes changes in tax rates such as those included in the tax cuts and jobs act enactment of new tax laws revisions of tax regulations and claims or litigation with taxing authorities could result in a material effect to our results of operations financial condition and liquidity higher tax rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

we are dependent on certain key suppliers of locomotives and rail – due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment parts and maintenance potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry therefore if one of the domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives discontinues manufacturing locomotives supplying parts or providing maintenance for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience significant cost increases and reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary for our operations additionally for a high percentage of our rail purchases we utilize two steel producers one domestic and one international that meet our specifications rail is critical to our operations for rail replacement programs maintenance and for adding additional network capacity new rail and storage yards and expansions of existing facilities this industry similarly has high barriers to entry and if one of these suppliers discontinues operations for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience both significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail for maintenance and other projects changes to trade agreements or policies that result in increased tariffs on goods imported into the united states could also result in significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail 

we may be affected by acts of terrorism war or risk of war – our rail lines facilities and equipment including rail cars carrying hazardous materials could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks terrorist attacks or other similar events any government response thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in addition insurance premiums for some or all of our current coverages could increase dramatically or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future

property and depreciation – our railroad operations are highly capital intensive and our large base of homogeneous networktype assets turns over on a continuous basis each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated service lives which are measured in years except for rail in highdensity traffic corridors ie all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment and yard and switching tracks for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics use and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources not as singular items we currently have more than 60 depreciable asset classes and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology asset strategies or other factors 

we determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad assets by means of depreciation studies we perform depreciation studies at least every 3 years for equipment and every 6 years for track assets ie rail and other track material ties and ballast and other road property our depreciation studies take into account the following factors 

 statistical analysis of historical patterns of use and retirements of each of our asset classes 

 evaluation of any expected changes in current operations and the outlook for continued use of the assets 

 evaluation of technological advances and changes to maintenance practices and 

 expected salvage to be received upon retirement 

for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track it has been our experience that the lives of rail in highdensity traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage ie the amount of weight carried over the rail the service lives also vary based on rail weight rail condition eg new or secondhand and rail type eg straight or curve our depreciation studies for rail in highdensity traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross tonmiles carried over the rail ie the weight of loaded and empty freight cars locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile for all other depreciable assets we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively 

under group depreciation the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated by multiplying the current replacement cost of track assets by a historical index factor derived from i inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ii the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate in addition we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies any deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets 

for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions i is unusual ii is material in amount and iii varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations 

when we purchase an asset we capitalize all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use however many of our assets are selfconstructed a large portion of our capital expenditures is for 

replacement of existing track assets and other road properties which is typically performed by our employees and for track line expansion and other capacity projects costs that are directly attributable to capital projects including overhead costs are capitalized direct costs that are capitalized as part of selfconstructed assets include material labor and work equipment indirect costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset 

costs incurred that extend the useful life of an asset improve the safety of our operations or improve operating efficiency are capitalized while normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred these costs are allocated using appropriate statistical bases total expense for repairs and maintenance incurred was  23 billion for 2019  25 billion for 2018 and  25 billion for 2017 

assets held under finance leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease amortization expense is computed using the straightline method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease

14 financial instruments 

shortterm investments – all of the company’s shortterm investments consist of time deposits and government agency securities these investments are considered level 2 investments and are valued at amortized cost which approximates fair value as of december 31 2019 the company had  75 million of shortterm investments of which  15 million are in a trust for the purpose of providing collateral for payment of certain other longterm liabilities and as such are reclassified as other assets all shortterm investments have a maturity of less than one year and are classified as heldtomaturity there were no transfers out of level 2 during the year ended december 31 2019 

fair value of financial instruments – the fair value of our short and longterm debt was estimated using a market value price model which utilizes applicable us treasury rates along with current market quotes on comparable debt securities all of the inputs used to determine the fair market value of the corporation’s longterm debt are level 2 inputs and obtained from an independent source at december 31 2019 the fair value of total debt was  272 billion approximately  20 billion more than the carrying value at december 31 2018 the fair value of total debt was  219 billion approximately  05 billion less than the carrying value the fair value of the corporation’s debt is a measure of its current value under present market conditions it does not impact the financial statements under current accounting rules the fair value of our cash equivalents approximates their carrying value due to the shortterm maturities of these instruments 

  

15 debt 

total debt as of december 31 2019 and 2018 is summarized below 



debt maturities – the following table presents aggregate debt maturities as of december 31 2019 excluding market value adjustments 



equipment encumbrances – equipment with a carrying value of approximately  16 billion and  18 billion at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively served as collateral for finance leases and other types of equipment obligations in accordance with the secured financing arrangements utilized to acquire or refinance such railroad equipment

cash consideration was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of debt and the balance of the unamortized discount and issue costs from the existing notes is being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the terms of the new notes no gain or loss was recognized as a result of the exchange costs related to the debt exchange that were payable to parties other than the debt holders totaled approximately  15 million and were included in interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2019 

credit facilities – at december 31 2019 we had  20 billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility which is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper credit facility withdrawals totaled  0 during 2019 commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investmentgrade borrowers the facility allows for borrowings at floating rates based on london interbank offered rates plus a spread depending upon credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt the 5 year facility requires upc to maintain a debttoebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization coverage ratio 

the definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the debttoebitda coverage ratio includes among other things certain credit arrangements finance leases guarantees unfunded and vested pension benefits under title iv of erisa and unamortized debt discount and deferred debt issuance costs at december 31 2019 the company was in compliance with the debttoebitda coverage ratio which allows us to carry up to  385 billion of debt as defined in the facility and we had  264 billion of debt as defined in the facility outstanding at that date the facility does not include any other financial restrictions credit rating triggers other than ratingdependent pricing or any other provision that could require us to post collateral the facility also includes a  150 million crossdefault provision and a changeofcontrol provision

16 variable interest entities 

we have entered into various lease transactions in which the structure of the leases contain variable interest entities vies these vies were created solely for the purpose of doing lease transactions principally involving railroad equipment and facilities and have no other activities assets or liabilities outside of the lease transactions within these lease arrangements we have the right to purchase some or all of the assets at fixed prices depending on market conditions fixedprice purchase options available in the leases could potentially provide benefits to us however these benefits are not expected to be significant 

we maintain and operate the assets based on contractual obligations within the lease arrangements which set specific guidelines consistent within the railroad industry as such we have no control over activities that could materially impact the fair value of the leased assets we do not hold the power to direct the activities of the vies and therefore do not control the ongoing activities that have a significant impact on the economic performance of the vies additionally we do not have the obligation to absorb losses of the vies or the right to receive benefits of the vies that could potentially be significant to the vies 

we are not considered to be the primary beneficiary and do not consolidate these vies because our actions and decisions do not have the most significant effect on the vie’s performance and our fixedprice purchase options are not considered to be potentially significant to the vies the future minimum lease payments associated with the vie leases totaled  15 billion as of december 31 2019 and are recorded as operating lease liabilities at present value in our consolidated statements of financial position 

  

17 leases 

we lease certain locomotives freight cars and other property for use in our rail operations we determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception we have lease agreements with lease and nonlease components and we have elected to not separate lease and nonlease components for all classes of underlying assets l eases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on our consolidated statements of financial position we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straightline basis over the lease term leases with initial terms in excess of 12 months are recorded as operating or financing leases in our consolidated statement of financial position operating leases are included in operating lease assets accounts payable and other current liabilities and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position finance leases are included in net properties debt due within one year and debt due after one year on our consolidated statements of financial position 

operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date as most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate we use a collateralized incremental borrowing rate for all operating leases based on the information available at commencement date including lease term in determining the present value of future payments the operating lease asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised operating lease expense is recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term and reported in equipment and other rents and financing lease expense is recorded as depreciation and interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 

the following are additional details related to our lease portfolio

18 commitments and contingencies 

asserted and unasserted claims – various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries we cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity to the extent possible we have recorded a liability where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated we do not expect that any known lawsuits claims environmental costs commitments contingent liabilities or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters 

personal injury – the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability including unasserted claims the federal employers’ liability act fela governs compensation for workrelated accidents under fela damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or outofcourt settlements we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 

our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments approximately 94  of the recorded liability is related to asserted claims and approximately 6  is related to unasserted claims at december 31 2019 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately  265 million to  289 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation 

our personal injury liability activity was as follows 



we reassess our estimated insurance recoveries annually and have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2019 and 2018 any changes to recorded insurance recoveries are included in the above table in the changes in estimates for prior years category 

environmental costs – we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations we have identified 360 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements this includes 31 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government 20 of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 

when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in our business we perform with assistance of our consultants environmental assessments on the property we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated our environmental liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments 

our environmental liability activity was as follows 



the environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties cost estimates are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and existing technology laws and regulations the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties sitespecific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal state and local laws governing environmental remediation current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

insurance – the company has a consolidated whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary the captive that provides insurance coverage for certain risks including fela claims and property coverage which are subject to reinsurance the captive entered into annual reinsurance treaty agreements that insure workers compensation general liability auto liability and fela risk the captive cedes a portion of its fela exposure through the treaty and assumes a proportionate share of the entire risk the captive receives direct premiums which are netted against the company’s premium costs in other expenses in the consolidated statements of income the treaty agreements provide for certain protections against the risk of treaty participants’ nonperformance and we do not believe our exposure to treaty participants’ nonperformance is material at this time we record both liabilities and reinsurance receivables using an actuarial analysis based on historical experience in our consolidated statements of financial position effective january 2019 the captive insurance subsidiary no longer participates in the reinsurance treaty agreement the company established a trust in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the purpose of providing collateral as required under the reinsurance treaty agreement for prior years’ participation 

guarantees – at december 31 2019 and 2018 we were contingently liable for  15 million and  22 million respectively in guarantees the fair value of these obligations as of both december 31 2019 and 2018 was  0  we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business and they include guaranteed obligations related to our affiliated operations the final guarantee expires in 2022 we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

indemnities – we are contingently obligated under a variety of indemnification arrangements although in some cases the extent of our potential liability is limited depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions

d includes 4457356 shares repurchased in october 2018 under accelerated share repurchase programs 

managements assessments of market conditions and other pertinent factors guide the timing and volume of all repurchases we expect to fund any share repurchases under this program through cash generated from operations the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties debt issuances and cash on hand open market repurchases are recorded in treasury stock at cost which includes any applicable commissions and fees 

from january 1 2020 through february 6 2020 we repurchased 27 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately  493 million 

accelerated share repurchase programs – the company has established accelerated share repurchase programs asrs with financial institutions to repurchase shares of our common stock these asrs have been structured so that at the time of commencement we pay a specified amount to the financial institutions and receive an initial delivery of shares additional shares may be received at the time of settlement the final number of shares to be received is based on the volume weighted average price of the company’s common stock during the asr term less a discount and subject to potential adjustments pursuant to the terms of such asr 

on february 26 2019 the company received 11795930 shares of its common stock repurchased under asrs for an aggregate of  25 billion upon settlement of these asrs in the third quarter of 2019 we received 3172900 additional shares 

on june 15 2018 the company received 19870292 shares of its common stock repurchased under asrs for an aggregate of  36 billion upon settlement of these asrs in the fourth quarter of 2018 we received 4457356 additional shares 

asrs are accounted for as equity transactions and at the time of receipt shares are included in treasury stock at fair market value as of the corresponding initiation or settlement date the company reflects shares received as a repurchase of common stock in the weighted average common shares outstanding calculation for basic and diluted earnings per share

 it em 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation that occur in connection with our business we routinely assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest available information and when necessary we seek input from our thirdparty advisors when making these assessments consistent with sec rules and requirements we describe below material pending legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities other proceedings arising under federal state or local environmental laws and regulations including governmental proceedings involving potential fines penalties or other monetary sanctions in excess of 100000 and such other pending matters that we may determine to be appropriate 

environmental matters 

in october 2016 the colorado department of public health  environment the agency expressed concerns over construction activities performed by uprr inside the moffat tunnel those activities which were deemed safety critical had caused contaminants from inside the tunnel to be discharged into the adjacent frasier river in violation of the tunnels national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit following extensive discussions with the agency and uprrs commitment to install and operate best management practices bmps the agency agreed to allow uprr to resume safetyrelated construction activities in february 2018 the agency issued a notice of violation nov which alleged violations of state water laws and the npdes permit the nov mandated a number of corrective actions to be implemented immediately and reserved for a later date the issue of penalties in june 2019 the agency contacted uprr to engage in discussions regarding an appropriate monetary penalty in september 2019 the parties reached a preliminary agreement on the amount of the penalty of 140000 the agreement was finalized and the penalty payment was made on january 21 2020 in the amount of 140000 

we receive notices from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are or may be liable under federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the us including sites on the superfund national priorities list or state superfund lists we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings and suits because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs 

information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies – environmental item 7 see also note 18 of the consolidated financial statements 

other matters 

antitrust litigation – as we reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2007 20 rail shippers many of whom are represented by the same law firms filed virtually identical antitrust lawsuits in various federal district courts against us and four other class i railroads in the us currently uprr and three other class i railroads are the named defendants in the lawsuit the original plaintiff filed the first of these claims in the us district court in new jersey on may 14 2007 these suits alleged that the named railroads engaged in pricefixing by establishing common fuel surcharges for certain rail traffic 

  

as previously reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2019 an appellate hearing related to the us district court for the district of columbia’s denial of class certification for the rail shippers was held on september 28 2018 on august 16 2019 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit affirmed the decision of us district court denying class certification the certification denial since the certification denial approximately 50 lawsuits have been filed in federal court based on claims identical to those alleged in the class certification case the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation is currently evaluating the appropriate forum and process for the administration of these cases union pacific believes these claims are without merit 

as we reported in our current report on form 8k filed on june 10 2011 the railroad received a complaint filed in the us district court for the district of columbia on june 7 2011 by oxbow carbon  minerals llc and related entities  oxbow  the fuel surcharge antitrust claim remains and was stayed pending the decision on class certification discussed above as a result of the certification denial and the individual cases a status conference with the court is expected to determine how the case will proceed 

we continue to deny the allegations that our fuel surcharge programs violate the antitrust laws or any other laws we believe that these lawsuits are without merit and we will vigorously defend our actions therefore we currently believe that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on any of our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

in 2016 a lawsuit was filed in us district court for the western district of washington alleging violations of the americans with disabilities act ada and genetic information nondiscrimination act relating to fitness for duty requirements for safety sensitive positions 

on august 8 2016 the us district court for the western district of washington granted plaintiffs motion to transfer their claim to the us district court of nebraska on february 5 2019 the us district court of nebraska granted plaintiffs’ motion to certify the ada allegations as a class action we were granted the right to appeal this class certification to the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit on march 13 2019 the matter was argued before the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit in november 2019 the district court proceedings have been stayed pending the decision by the eighth circuit we continue to deny these allegations believe this lawsuit is without merit and will defend our actions we believe this lawsuit will not have a material adverse effect on any of our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and applicable notes to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 and other information in this report including risk factors set forth in item 1a and critical accounting policies and cautionary information at the end of this item 7 the following section generally discusses 2019 and 2018 items and yeartoyear comparisons between 2019 and 2018 discussions of 2017 items and yeartoyear comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this form 10k can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of the company’s annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018 

the railroad along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates is our one reportable business segment although revenue is analyzed by commodity we analyze the net financial results of the railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of the rail network 

executive summary 

2019 results 

 safety – while 2019 was a year of significant operational change at the company we remained committed to the safety of our employees our customers and the public as we implemented unified plan 2020 we remained focused on identifying and managing risk and training our employees as their work environment changed despite these efforts our safety results were not good enough our personal injury incidents per 200000 employeehours increased 11 from 2018 and our reportable derailment incident rate per million train miles increased 30 although there was a significant increase in reportable derailments for the year we did see sequential improvement in the fourth quarter we want every employee to return home safely every day and to eliminate all derailments so we must do better in 2020 by identifying and implementing best practices in this ever changing environment 

 network operations unified plan 2020 – the year began with a series of significant weather events heavy snowfall and harsh winter conditions in the midwest and pacific northwest were followed by widespread flooding across the central and southern portions of our network despite the disruptions we remained focused on the implementation of unified plan 2020 the company’s plan for operating a safe reliable and efficient railroad by increasing reliability of our service product reducing variability in network operations and improving resource utilization costs 

although our operational changes were impacted by weather in the early part of 2019 our key performance indicators have improved substantially yearoveryear improvement in asset utilization and fewer car classifications led to 17 improvement in freight car terminal dwell and 6 improvement in freight car velocity we also saw 13 improvement in locomotive productivity and 2 improvement in work force productivity additional detail on these metrics are discussed in other operating  performance and financial statistics of item 7 

a component of unified plan 2020 is to look for ways to reduce “car touches” on our network which ultimately results in opportunities to reduce the number of terminals where we perform switching activities our terminal rationalization efforts in 2019 include no longer humping cars at our yards in pine bluff ar proviso chicago il hinkle or and neff yard in kansas city mo in addition we have curtailed switching and equipment maintenance operations at various locations throughout the network 

 freight revenues – our freight revenues decreased 5 yearoveryear to 202 billion driven by a volume decline of 6 and negative mix of traffic partially offset by core pricing gains we saw weak demand in several markets particularly intermodal coal frac sand grain finished vehicles and lumber these declines were partially offset by growth in petroleum products construction materials plastics wheat and hazardous waste markets 

 financial results – in 2019 we generated operating income of 86 billion flat with 2018 despite the 6 carload decline lower volumes productivity initiatives and lower fuel prices drove operating expenses down 8 from 2018 these factors coupled with improved pricing offset the impact of the revenue decline and drove an alltime record 606 operating ratio improving 21 points from 2018 

net income of nearly 6 0 billion translated into earnings of 838 per diluted share up 6 from last year 

 fuel prices – our average price of diesel fuel in 2019 was 213 per gallon a decrease of 7 from 2018 the lower price resulted in lower operating expenses of 144 million excluding any impact from yearoveryear volume declines grosston miles decreased 9 and our fuel consumption rate computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross tonmiles improved 2 both of which drove lower fuel expense 

 cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow – cash generated by operating activities totaled nearly 86 billion yielding free cash flow of 26 billion after reductions of 34 billion for cash used in investing activities and 26 billion in dividends which included two 10 increases in our quarterly dividend per share from 080 in the fourth quarter of 2018 to 088 in the first quarter of 2019 and 097 in the third quarter of 2019 free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid 

free cash flow is not considered a financial measure under gaap by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe free cash flow is important to management and investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financings free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for cash provided by operating activities the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities gaap measure to free cash flow nongaap measure 



2020 outlook 

 safety – operating a safe railroad benefits all our constituents our employees customers shareholders and the communities we serve we will continue using a multifaceted approach to safety utilizing technology risk assessment training and employee engagement quality control and targeted capital investments we will continue using and expanding the deployment of total safety culture courage to care and commit coaching observing mentoring and motivating with integrity and trust throughout our operations which allows us to identify and implement best practices for employee and operational safety we have formed an operating practices command center to identify causes of mainline service interruptions and develop solutions in addition they assist employees with understanding policies procedures and best practices for handling trains we will continue our efforts to utilize data to identify and mitigate risk detect rail defects improve or close crossings and educate the public and law enforcement agencies about crossing safety through a combination of our own programs including risk assessment strategies industry programs and local community activities across the network 

 network operations – in 2020 we will continue to implement unified plan 2020 and g550 initiatives to further increase reliability of our service product reduce variability in network operations and improve resource utilization continued implementation of these initiatives will include utilizing our existing network capacity longer train length and fewer car touches resulting in additional terminal consolidation opportunities improved asset utilization and fewer car classifications these additional changes combined with other g550 initiatives are designed to better align our management structure and decision making processes to be more agile and responsive to our customers’ needs 

 market conditions – we expect uncertainties in various markets to continue in 2020 similar to 2019 natural gas prices and weather conditions may impact demand for coal crude oil price spreads may drive demand for petroleum products and drilling materials available truck capacity could impact our intermodal business and international trade agreements such as united statesmexicocanada agreement and “phase one” with china should promote trade 

  

  

 fuel prices – projections for crude oil and natural gas continue to fluctuate in the current environment we again could see volatile fuel prices during the year as they are sensitive to global and us domestic demand refining capacity geopolitical events weather conditions and other factors as prices fluctuate there will be a timing impact on earnings as our fuel surcharge programs trail increases or decreases in fuel price by approximately two months 

significant changes in fuel prices could have an impact on the amount of consumer discretionary spending impacting demand for various consumer products we transport alternatively those changes could have an inverse impact on commodities such as coal and domestic drillingrelated shipments 

 capital plan – in 2020 we expect our capital plan to be approximately 31 billion down slightly compared to 2019 it is anticipated that capital spending in most asset categories will be flat or down compared to 2019 spending in addition this plan includes an increase in capacity and facility investments intended to improve productivity and operational efficiency the capital plan may be revised if business conditions warrant or if new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments see further discussion in this item 7 under liquidity and capital resources – capital plan 

 financial expectations – we expect volume to be slightly positive in 2020 compared to 2019 in the current environment we expect continued margin improvement driven by pricing opportunities in excess of inflation ongoing g550 productivity initiatives including unified plan 2020 resulting in at least 500 million of productivity savings while better leveraging our resources and strengthening our franchise 

results of operations 

operating revenues 



we generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our four commodity groups freight revenues vary with volume carloads and average revenue per car arc changes in price traffic mix and fuel surcharges drive arc customer incentives which are primarily provided for shipping tofrom specific locations or based on cumulative volumes are recorded as a reduction to operating revenues customer incentives that include variable consideration based on cumulative volumes are estimated using the expected value method which is based on available historical current and forecasted volumes and recognized as the related performance obligation is satisfied we recognize freight revenues over time as shipments move from origin to destination the allocation of revenue between reporting periods is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred 

other revenues consist primarily of revenues earned by our other subsidiaries primarily logistics and commuter rail operations and accessorial revenues other subsidiary revenues are generally recognized over time as shipments move from origin to destination the allocation of revenue between reporting periods is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred accessorial revenues are recognized at a point in time as performance obligations are satisfied 

freight revenues decreased 5 yearoveryear to 202 billion driven by a 6 volume decline and negative mix of traffic partially offset by core pricing gains we saw weak demand in several markets particularly intermodal coal frac sand grain finished vehicles and lumber these declines were partially offset by growth in petroleum products construction materials plastics wheat and hazardous waste markets 

our fuel surcharge programs generated freight revenues of 16 billion and 17 billion in 2019 and 2018 respectively fuel surcharge revenue in 2019 decreased 183 million as a result of a 6 decline in carloadings and a 7 decrease in fuel price 

in 2019 other revenues increased from 2018 driven by higher accessorial charges focused on incentivizing customers’ efficient use of company assets partially offset by volume declines 

the following tables summarize the yearoveryear changes in freight revenues revenue carloads and arc by commodity type 







a for intermodal shipments each container or trailer equals one carload 





‎ 



2018 driven by a 7 decline in volume partially offset by core pricing gains the decrease in volume was driven by fewer shipments of automotive parts grain coal intermodal and finished vehicles partially offset by growth in petroleum products metallic minerals beverages and industrial chemicals shipments 

‎ 

operating expenses 





compensation and benefits – compensation and benefits include wages payroll taxes health and welfare costs pension costs other postretirement benefits and incentive costs in 2019 expenses decreased 10 compared to 2018 due to volumerelated costs reduced workforce levels and the employment tax refund wage inflation weatherrelated challenges and workforce reduction expenses partially offset the yearoveryear improvement 

fuel – fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and nonhighway vehicles and heavy equipment locomotive diesel fuel prices which averaged 213 per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in 2019 compared to 229 per gallon in 2018 decreased expenses 144 million grosston miles decreased 9 and our fuel consumption rate computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross tonmiles improved 2 which both drove lower fuel expense 

purchased services and materials – expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors and other service providers including equipment maintenance and contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services materials used to maintain the railroad’s lines structures and equipment costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other railroads transportation and lodging for train crew employees trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers leased automobile maintenance expenses and tools and supplies purchased services and materials decreased 8 in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to volumerelated costs for intermodal and transload services lower locomotive expense due to a smaller active fleet and lower costs for services purchased from outside contractors higher costs associated with derailments and weatherrelated challenges partially offset these reductions 

depreciation – the majority of depreciation relates to road property including rail ties ballast and other track material a higher depreciable asset base increased depreciation expense in 2019 compared to 2018 

equipment and other rents – equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies freight car intermodal and locomotive leases and office and other rent expenses equity income from certain equity method investments is also included equipment and other rents expense decreased 8 compared to 2018 largely driven by volume declines improved freight car cycle times and lower locomotive freight car and container lease expenses 

other – other expenses include state and local taxes freight equipment and property damage utilities insurance personal injury environmental employee travel telephone and cellular computer software bad debt and other general expenses other expenses increased 4 in 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of higher casualty costs and state and local taxes lower costs associated with employee travel and an insurance reimbursement for weatherrelated expenses incurred earlier in the year partially offset these increases 

nonoperating items 



other income – other income increased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to 85 million of expense associated with earlyextinguishment of outstanding debentures and mortgage bonds in 2018 31 million in interest income associated with the employment tax refund in 2019 and lower costs associated with our benefit plans 

interest expense – interest expense increased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to an increased weightedaverage debt level of 248 billion in 2019 from 201 billion in 2018 partially offset by the impact of a lower effective interest rate of 43 in 2019 compared to 44  in 2018 

income taxes – income tax expense increased 3 in 2019 compared to 2018 our effective tax rate for 2019 increased 07 points to 236 compared to 229 in 2018 the increase was driven by higher state and foreign taxes as compared to the prior year 

other operatingperformance and financial statistics 

we report a number of key performance measures weekly to the stb we provide this data on our website at wwwupcominvestoraarstbreportsindexhtm 

operatingperformance statistics 

railroad performance measures are included in the table below 



a prior years have been recast to conform to the current year presentation which reflects minor refinements 

b as reported to the stb 

gross and revenue tonmiles – gross tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled revenue tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles gross tonmiles and revenue tonmiles decreased 9 and 11 respectively in 2019 compared to 2018 driven by a 6 decline in carloadings changes in commodity mix drove the variance in yearoveryear decreases between gross tonmiles revenue tonmiles and carloads 

freight car velocity – freight car velocity measures the average daily miles per car on our network the two key drivers of this metric are the speed of the train between terminals average train speed and the time a rail car spends at the terminals average terminal dwell time implementation of unified plan 2020 drove the 6 improvement from 2018 average terminal dwell time in 2019 decreased 17 compared to 2018 largely due to improved terminal processes transportation plan changes to eliminate switches and a decrease in freight car inventory levels partially offsetting the improvements in terminal dwell average train speed in 2019 declined 4 compared to 2018 largely due to an increase in work events and weatherrelated challenges in the first half of the year however the overall movement of freight cars is faster 

locomotive productivity – locomotive productivity is gross tonmiles per average daily locomotive horsepower locomotive productivity increased 13 in 2019 compared to 2018 driven by a 20 reduction in our average active fleet size 

workforce productivity – workforce productivity is average daily car miles per employee workforce productivity improved 2 as average daily car miles decreased 9 while employees decreased 11 compared to 2018 lower carload volumes drove the decline in average daily car miles the 11 decline in employee levels was driven by a 6 decline in carload volumes initiatives to further rightsize the workforce and a smaller capital workforce at the end of 2019 approximately 5000 employees across all crafts were either furloughed or in alternate work status 

operating ratio – operating ratio is our operating expenses reflected as a percentage of operating revenue our operating ratio of 606 was an alltime record and improved 21 points compared to 2018 mainly driven by productivity initiatives core pricing gains and lower fuel prices which were partially offset by inflation increased casualty costs and other cost hurdles 

return on average common shareholders’ equity 



return on invested capital as adjusted roic 



roic is considered a nongaap financial measure by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our longterm capital investments in addition we currently use roic as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of equity compensation for our executives roic should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for other information provided in accordance with gaap the most comparable gaap measure is return on average common shareholders’ equity the tables above provide reconciliations from return on average common shareholders’ equity to roic at both december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 the incremental borrowing rate on operating leases was 37 at december 31 2017 our operating leases were discounted using our effective interest rate on debt of 46 

net return on invested capital as adjusted net roic 

the table below reconciles roic as previously calculated to net roic for items affecting comparability 



a adjustments remove the impact of 59 billion and 139 million from both 123117 net income and 123117 shareholders’ equity 

net roic is considered a nongaap financial measure by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our longterm capital investments we use net roic to demonstrate year over year comparability for significant items net roic should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for other information provided in accordance with gaap the most comparable gaap measure is return on average common shareholders’ equity 

adjusted debt  adjusted ebitda 



adjusted debt to adjusted ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and adjustments for other income and interest on present value of operating leases is considered a nongaap financial measure by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the company’s ability to sustain given debt levels including leases with the cash generated from operations in addition a comparable measure is used by rating agencies when reviewing the company’s credit rating adjusted debt to adjusted ebitda should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for net income the table above provides reconciliations from net income to adjusted debt to adjusted ebitda at both december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 the incremental borrowing rate on operating leases was 37 at december 31 2017 operating leases were discounted using our effective interest rate on debt of 46 

‎ 

liquidity and capital resources 

at both december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 we had a working capital deficit the deficits are primarily due to upcoming debt maturities as past years indicate it is not unusual for us to have a working capital deficit however we believe it is not an indication of a lack of liquidity we also maintain adequate resources including our credit facility and when necessary access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements 

as of december 31 2019 our principal sources of liquidity included cash cash equivalents our receivables securitization facility and our revolving credit facility as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets we had 20 billion of committed credit available under our credit facility with no borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2019 we did not draw on our current facility or previous facility at any time during 2019 the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the 800 million capacity receivables securitization facility was 400 million as of december 31 2019 our access to this receivables securitization facility may be reduced or restricted if our bond ratings fall to certain levels below investment grade if our bond rating were to deteriorate it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financings is dependent on market conditions deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability we expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity through any or all of the following sources or activities i increasing the size or utilization of our receivables securitization ii issuing commercial paper iii entering into bank loans outside of our revolving credit facility or iv issuing bonds or other debt securities to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets the company’s 20 billion revolving credit facility is intended to support the issuance of commercial paper by upc and also serves as an additional source of liquidity to fund short term needs the company currently does not intend to make any borrowings under this facility 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to lower net income 

‎ 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities in 2019 increased compared to 2018 

the following tables detail cash capital investments and track statistics for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 



a other includes bridges and tunnels signals other road assets and road work equipment 

b locomotives and freight cars include early lease buyouts of 290 million in 2019 290 million in 2018 and 173 million in 2017 



capital plan – in 2020 we expect our capital plan to be approximately 31 billion which may be revised if business conditions or the regulatory environment affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments while asset replacements will fluctuate as part of our renewal strategy we expect to use 75 to 80 of our capital investments to renew and improve existing capital assets we will continue to balance investment in our network infrastructure and terminal capacity as appropriate including new capacity investments designed to improve productivity and operational efficiency significant investments will be made for locomotive modernization and freight car replacements 

we expect to fund our 2020 cash capital plan by using some or all of the following cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and cash on hand our annual capital plan is a critical component of our longterm strategic plan we expect our plan will enhance the longterm value of the company for our shareholders by providing sufficient resources to i replace and improve our existing track infrastructure to provide safe and fluid operations ii increase network efficiency and productivity by adding or improving facilities and track and iii make investments that meet customer demand and take advantage of opportunities for longterm growth 

  

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities increased in 2019 compared to 2018 driven by higher dividend payments in 2019 of 2598 million compared to 2299 million in 2018 reflecting higher dividends per share decreases in net debt issued of 2574 were mostly offset by a decrease in share repurchase programs of 2421 million 

see note 15 of the consolidated financial statements for a description of all our outstanding financing arrangements and significant new borrowings 

share repurchase programs 

effective april 1 2019 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 150 million shares of our common stock by march 31 2022 replacing our previous repurchase program these repurchases may be made on the open market or through other transactions our management has sole discretion with respect to determining the timing and amount of these transactions as of december 31 2019 we repurchased a total of 372 billion of our common stock since commencement of our repurchase programs in 2007 the table below represents shares repurchased under repurchase programs during 2018 and 2019 



a includes 11795930 shares repurchased in february 2019 under accelerated share repurchase programs 

b includes 19870292 shares repurchased in june 2018 under accelerated share repurchase programs 

c includes 3172900 shares repurchased in august 2019 under accelerated share repurchase programs 

d includes 4457356 shares repurchased in october 2018 under accelerated share repurchase programs 

managements assessments of market conditions and other pertinent factors guide the timing and volume of all repurchases we expect to fund any share repurchases under this program through cash generated from operations the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties debt issuances and cash on hand open market repurchases are recorded in treasury stock at cost which includes any applicable commissions and fees 

from january 1 2020 through february 6 2020 we repurchased 27 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately 493 million 

accelerated share repurchase programs – the company has established accelerated share repurchase programs asrs with financial institutions to repurchase shares of our common stock these asrs have been structured so that at the time of commencement we pay a specified amount to the financial institutions and receive an initial delivery of shares additional shares may be received at the time of settlement the final number of shares to be received is based on the volume weighted average price of the company’s common stock during the asr term less a discount and subject to potential adjustments pursuant to the terms of such asr 

on february 26 2019 the company received 11795930 shares of its common stock repurchased under asrs for an aggregate of 25 billion upon settlement of these asrs in the third quarter of 2019 we received 3172900 additional shares 

on june 15 2018 the company received 19870292 shares of its common stock repurchased under asrs for an aggregate of 36 billion upon settlement of these asrs in the fourth quarter of 2018 we received 4457356 additional shares 

asrs are accounted for as equity transactions and at the time of receipt shares are included in treasury stock at fair market value as of the corresponding initiation or settlement date the company reflects shares received as a repurchase of common stock in the weighted average common shares outstanding calculation for basic and diluted earnings per share 

‎ 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and as referenced in the tables below we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments including material sources of offbalance sheet and structured finance arrangements other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets as described in item 1a of part ii of this report there is no known trend demand commitment event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition our commercial obligations financings and commitments are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations particularly within the transportation industry 

the following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of december 31 2019 



a excludes finance lease obligations of 605 million as well as unamortized discount and deferred issuance costs of 1194 million includes an interest component of 18078 million 

b includes leases for locomotives freight cars other equipment and real estate 

c represents total obligations including interest component of 102 million 

d purchase obligations include locomotive maintenance contracts purchase commitments for fuel purchases ties ballast and rail and agreements to purchase other goods and services for amounts where we cannot reasonably estimate the year of settlement they are reflected in the other column 

e includes estimated other post retirement medical and life insurance payments payments made under the unfunded pension plan for the next ten years 

f future cash flows for income tax contingencies reflect the recorded liabilities and assets for unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties as of december 31 2019 for amounts where the year of settlement is uncertain they are reflected in the other column 



a none of the credit facility was used as of december 31 2019 

b 400 million of the receivables securitization facility was utilized as of december 31 2019 which is accounted for as debt the full program matures in july 2022 

c includes guaranteed obligations related to our affiliated operations 

d none of the letters of credit were drawn upon as of december 31 2019 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

guarantees – at december 31 2019 and 2018 we were contingently liable for 15 million and 22 million in guarantees the fair value of these obligations as of both december 31 2019 and 2018 was 0 we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business and they include guaranteed obligations related to our affiliated operations the final guarantee expires in 2022 we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees we do not expect that these 

guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

other matters 

labor agreements – approximately 85 of our fulltime employees are represented by 14 major rail unions pursuant to the railway labor act rla our collective bargaining agreements are subject to modification every five years existing agreements remain in effect until new agreements are ratified or until the rla procedures are exhausted the rla procedures include mediation potential arbitration coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential emergency boards and congressional intervention the current round of negotiations began on january 1 2020 related to years 20202024 contract negotiations historically continue for an extended period of time and work stoppages during negotiations are rare 

inflation – long periods of inflation significantly increase asset replacement costs for capitalintensive companies as a result assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels depreciation charges on an inflationadjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 

sensitivity analyses – the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 

at december 31 2019 we had variablerate debt representing approximately 34 of our total debt if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2020 than our december 31 2019 variable rate which was approximately 25 our interest expense would increase by approximately 85 million this amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balances of our variablerate debt at december 31 2019 

market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2019 and amounts to an increase of approximately 34 billion to the fair value of our debt at december 31 2019 we estimated the fair values of our fixedrate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 

accounting pronouncements – see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

asserted and unasserted claims – various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries we cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity to the extent possible we have recorded a liability where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated we do not expect that any known lawsuits claims environmental costs commitments contingent liabilities or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters 

indemnities – our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements including certain tax indemnifications can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions 

climate change – although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item 1a of this report we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact however we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment including investments in new technologies using training programs and technology to reduce fuel consumption and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency 

  

cr itical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 2 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 these critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 

personal injury – the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability including unasserted claims the federal employers’ liability act fela governs compensation for workrelated accidents under fela damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or outofcourt settlements we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 

our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments approximately 94 of the recorded liability is related to asserted claims and approximately 6 is related to unasserted claims at december 31 2019 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 265 million to 289 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation 

our personal injury liability activity was as follows 



our personal injury claims activity was as follows 



we reassess our estimated insurance recoveries annually and have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2019 and 2018 any changes to recorded insurance recoveries are included in the above table in the changes in estimates for prior years category 

environmental costs – we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations we have identified 360 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements this includes 31 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government 20 of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 

when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in our business we perform with assistance of our consultants environmental assessments on the property we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated our environmental liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments 

our environmental liability activity was as follows 



our environmental site activity was as follows 



the environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties cost estimates are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and existing technology laws and regulations the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties sitespecific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal state and local laws governing environmental remediation current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

property and depreciation – our railroad operations are highly capital intensive and our large base of homogeneous networktype assets turns over on a continuous basis each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enables us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated service lives which are measured in years except for rail in highdensity traffic corridors ie all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment and yard and switching tracks for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics use and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources not as singular items we currently have more than 60 depreciable asset classes and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology asset strategies or other factors 

we determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property by means of depreciation studies we perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets ie rail and other track material ties and ballast and other road property our depreciation studies take into account the following factors 

 statistical analysis of historical patterns of use and retirements of each of our asset classes 

 evaluation of any expected changes in current operations and the outlook for continued use of the assets 

 evaluation of technological advances and changes to maintenance practices and 

 expected salvage to be received upon retirement 

for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track it has been our experience that the lives of rail in highdensity traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage ie the amount of weight carried over the rail the service lives also vary based on rail weight rail condition eg new or secondhand and rail type eg straight or curve our depreciation studies for rail in highdensity traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross tonmiles carried over the rail ie the weight of loaded and empty freight cars locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile rail in highdensity traffic corridors accounts for approximately 70 percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material based on the number of gross tonmiles carried over our rail in high density traffic corridors during 2019 the estimated service lives of the majority of this rail ranged from approximately 21 years to approximately 45 years for all other depreciable assets we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively 

estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to changes in physical use technology asset strategies and other factors that will have an impact on the retirement profiles of our assets we are not aware of any specific factors that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service lives of our assets actual use and retirement of our assets may vary from our current estimates which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future periods 

changes in estimated useful lives of our assets due to the results of our depreciation studies could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately 68 million if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were decreased by one year annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately 73 million our 2019 depreciation studies have resulted in lower depreciation rates for some asset classes these lower rates will partially offset the impact of a projected higher depreciable asset base resulting in an increase in total depreciation expense by approximately 2 in 2020 versus 2019 

under group depreciation the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated by multiplying the current replacement cost of track assets by a historical index factor derived from i inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ii the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate in addition we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies any deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets 

for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions i it is unusual ii it is material in amount and iii it varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies during the last three fiscal years no gains or losses were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad properties a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations 

income taxes – we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns these expected future tax consequences are measured based on current tax law the effects of future tax legislation are not anticipated future tax legislation such as a change in the corporate tax rate could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity for example a permanent 1 increase in future income tax rates would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately 507 million similarly a permanent 1 decrease in future income tax rates would decrease our deferred tax liability by approximately 507 million 

when appropriate we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reflect that these tax assets may not be realized in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized based on management’s judgments using available evidence for purposes of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize a deferred tax asset in 2019 and 2018 there were no valuation allowances 

we recognize tax benefits that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement a liability for “unrecognized tax benefits” is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards 

pension and other postretirement benefits – we use an actuarial analysis to measure the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and medical and life insurance benefits opeb to eligible employees in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make several assumptions the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rates and expected rate of return on pension assets for opeb the critical assumptions are the discount rates and health care cost trend rate 

we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually and selected assumptions are based on the following factors 

 we measure the service cost and interest cost components of our net periodic benefit cost by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year discount rates are based on a mercer yield curve of high quality corporate bonds rated aa by a recognized rating agency 

 expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return taking into consideration current and expected market conditions 

 health care cost trend rate is based on our historical rates of inflation and expected market conditions 

the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit for 2020 and the estimated impact on 2020 net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit relative to a change in those assumptions 





the following table presents the net periodic pension and opeb cost for the years ended december 31

manifest and premium business bulk traffic primarily consists of coal grain soda ash ethanol rock and crude oil shipped in unit trains – trains transporting a single commodity from one origin to one destination manifest traffic includes individual carload or less than trainload business involving commodities such as lumber steel paper food and chemicals the transportation of finished vehicles auto parts intermodal containers and truck trailers are included as part of our premium business in 2018 we generated freight revenues totali ng 214 billion from the following four commodity groups 

﻿ 

agricultural products – transportation of grains commodities produced from these grains fertilizer and food and beverage products generated 21 of the railroad’s 2018 freight revenue we access most major grain markets linking the midwest and western us producing areas to export terminals in the pacific northwest and gulf coast ports as well as mexico we also serve significant domestic markets including grain processors animal feeders and ethanol producers in the midwest west south and rocky mountain states fertilizer movements originate in the gulf coast region the western us and canada through interline access for delivery to major agricultural users in the midwest western us as well as abroad 

﻿ 

energy – the company’ s e nergy shipments are grouped into th e following three categories i coal ii  sand and iii  petroleum liquid petroleum gases lpg and renewables in 2018 this group generated 21 of our freight revenue the railroad’s network supports the transportation of coal shipments to independent and regulated power companies and industrial facilities throughout the us through interchange gateways and ports uprr’s reach extends to eastern us utilities as well as to mexico and other international destinations coal traffic originating in the powder river basin prb area of wyoming is the largest segment of the railroad’s coal business demand for hydraulic fracturing sand or fracsand is generated by oil and gas drilling whereas the company’s petroleum and lpg shipments are primarily impacted by refinery utilization rates  regional crude pricing differentials pipeline capacity and the use of asphalt for road programs renewable shipments consist primarily of biomass exports and wind turbine components 

﻿ 

industrial – our extensive network facilitates the movement of numerous commodities between thousands of origin and destination points throughout north america the industrial group consists of several categories including construction industrial chemicals plastics forest products specialized products primarily waste lime salt and government metals and ores and soda ash transportation of these products accounted for 27 of our freight revenue in 2018 commercial residential and governmental infrastructure investments drive shipments of steel aggregates cement components cement and wood products industrial and light manufacturing plants receive steel nonferrous materials minerals and other raw materials 

﻿ 

the industrial chemicals market consists of a vast number of chemical compounds that support the manufacturing of more complex chemicals plastics shipments support automotive housing and the durable   and disposable consumer goods markets   paper and packaging commodities as well as appliances move to major metropolitan areas for consumers forest product shipments originate primarily in the pacific northwest or western canada and move throughout the us for use in new home construction and repair and remodeling oil and gas drilling generates demand for raw steel finished pipe stone and drilling fluid commodities soda ash originates in southwestern wyoming and california destined for chemical and glass producing markets in north america and abroad 

  

premium – in 2018 the premium franchise generated 31 of union pacific’s total freight revenue our premium franchise includes three segments international intermodal domestic intermodal and finished vehicles international business consists of import and export traffic moving   in 20 or 40foot shipping 

 

containers that mainly passes through west coast ports served by up’s extensive terminal network   domestic business includes container and trailer traffic picked   up and delivered within north america for intermodal marketing   companies primarily shipper agents and logistics companies as well as truckload carriers

working capital – at december 31 2018 we had a working capital deficit at december 31 2017 we had a working capital surplus the deficit at 2018 yearend was primarily due to an increase in upcoming debt maturities as past years indicate it is not unusual for us to have a working capital deficit however we believe it is not an indication of a lack of liquidity we also maintain adequate resources including our credit facility and when necessary access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements 

﻿ 

competition – we are subject to competition from other railroads motor carriers ship and barge operators and pipelines our main railroad competitor is burlington northern santa fe llc its primary subsidiary bnsf railway company bnsf operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors in addition we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers motor carrier competition exists for all four of our commodity groups excluding most coal shipments because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and gulf coast waterways barges can be particularly competitive especially for grain and bulk commodities in certain areas where we operate in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times quality and reliability of service from motor carriers and other railroads motor carriers in particular can have an advantage over railroads with respect to transit times and timeliness of service however railroads are much more fuelefficient than trucks which reduces the impact of transporting goods on the environment and public infrastructure and we have been making efforts to convert certain truck traffic to rail additionally we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any of the following could also affect the competitiveness of our transportation services for some or all of our commodities i improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation ii legislation that eliminates or significantly increases the size or weight limitations applied to motor carriers or iii legislation or regulatory changes that impose operating restrictions on railroads or that adversely affect the profitability of some or all railroad traffic finally many movements face product or geographic competition where our customers can use different products eg natural gas instead of coal sorghum instead of corn or commodities from different locations eg grain from states or countries that we do not serve crude oil from different regions sourcing different commodities or different locations allows shippers to substitute different carriers and such competition may reduce our volume or constrain prices for more information regarding risks we face from competition see the risk factors in item 1a of this report 

﻿ 

key suppliers – we depend on two key domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives due to the capital intensive nature of the locomotive manufacturing business and sophistication of this equipment potential new suppliers face high barriers of entry into this industry therefore if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives supplying parts or providing maintenance for any reason including insolvency or bankruptcy we could experience a significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations additionally for a high percentage of our rail purchases we utilize two steel producers one domestic and one international that meet our specifications rail is critical for maintenance replacement improvement and expansion of our network and facilities rail manufacturing also has high barriers of entry and if one of those suppliers discontinues operations for any reason including insolvency or bankruptcy we could experience cost increases and difficulty obtaining rail 

 

employees – approximately 85 of our fulltime employees are represented by 14 major rail unions pursuant to the railway labor act rla our collective bargaining agreements are subject to modification every five years the most recent round of negotiations started on january 1 2015 and throughout 2017 and 2018 we concluded new agreements with all 14 major rail unions existing agreements remain in effect until new agreements are ratified or until the rla procedures are exhausted the rla procedures include mediation potential arbitration coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential emergency boards and congressional intervention the next round of negotiations begins with the service of rla section 6 notices on or about november 1 2019 related to years 20192023 contract negotiations historically continue for an extended period of time and work stoppages during negotiations are rare 

﻿ 

railroad security – our security efforts consist of a wide variety of measures including employee training engagement with our customers training of emergency responders and partnerships with numerous federal state and local government agencies while federal law requires us to protect the confidentiality of our security plans designed to safeguard against terrorism and other security incidents the following provides a general overview of our security initiatives 

﻿ 

uprr security measures – we maintain a comprehensive security plan designed to both deter and respond to any potential or actual threats as they arise the plan includes four levels of alert status each with its own set of countermeasures we employ our own police force consisting of commissioned and highlytrained officers our employees also undergo recurrent security and preparedness training as well as federallymandated hazardous materials and security training we regularly review the sufficiency of our employee training programs we maintain the capability to move critical operations to backup facilities in different locations 

﻿ 

we operate an emergency response management center 24 hours a day the center receives reports of emergencies dangerous or potentially dangerous conditions and other safety and security issues from our employees the public law enforcement and other government officials in cooperation with government officials we monitor both threats and public events and as necessary we may alter rail traffic flow at times of concern to minimize risk to communities and our operations we comply with the hazardous materials routing rules and other requirements imposed by federal law we also design our operating plan to expedite the movement of hazardous material shipments to minimize the time rail cars remain idle at yards and terminals located in or near major population centers additionally in compliance with transportation security agency regulations we deployed information systems and instructed employees in tracking and documenting the handoff of rail security sensitive materials with customers and interchange partners 

﻿ 

we also have established a number of our own innovative safety and securityoriented initiatives ranging from various investments in technology to the officer on train program which provides local law enforcement officers with the opportunity to ride with train crews to enhance their understanding of railroad operations and risks our staff of information security professionals continually assesses cyber security risks and implements mitigation programs that evolve with the changing technology threat environment to date we have not experienced any material disruption of our operations due to a cyber threat or attack directed at us 

﻿ 

cooperation with federal state and local government agencies – we work closely on physical and cyber security initiatives with government agencies including the us department of transportation dot and the department of homeland security dhs as well as local police departments fire departments and other first responders in conjunction with the association of american railroads aar we sponsor ask rail a mobile application which provides first responders with secure links to electronic information including commodity and emergency response information required by emergency personnel to respond to accidents and other situations we also participate in the national joint terrorism task force a multiagency effort established by the us department of justice and the federal bureau of investigation to combat and prevent terrorism 

﻿ 

we work with the coast guard us customs and border protection cbp and the military transport management command which monitor shipments entering the uprr rail network at us border crossings and ports we were the first railroad in the us to be named a partner in cbp’s customstrade partnership against terrorism a partnership designed to develop enhance and maintain effective security processes throughout the global supply chain 

﻿ 

cooperation with customers and trade associations – through transcaer transportation community awareness and emergency response we work with the aar the american chemistry council the american petroleum institute and other chemical trade groups to provide communities with preparedness 

 

tools including the training of emergency responders in cooperation with the federal railroad administration fra and other interested groups we are also working to develop additional improvements to tank car design that will further limit the risk of releases of hazardous materials

﻿ 

we must manage fluctuating demand for our services and network capacity – if there are significant reductions in demand for rail services with respect to one or more commodities or changes in consumer preferences that affect the businesses of our customers we may experience increased costs associated 

 

with resizing our operations including higher unit operating costs and costs for the storage of locomotives rail cars and other equipment workforce adjustments and other related activities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity if there is significant demand for our services that exceeds the designed capacity of our network we may experience network difficulties including congestion and reduced velocity that could compromise the level of service we provide to our customers this level of demand may also compound the impact of weather and weatherrelated events on our operations and velocity although we continue to improve our transportation plan add capacity improve operations at our yards and other facilities and improve our ability to address surges in demand for any reason with adequate resources we cannot be sure that these measures will fully or adequately address any service shortcomings resulting from demand exceeding our planned capacity we may experience other operational or service difficulties related to network capacity dramatic and unplanned fluctuations in our customers’ demand for rail service with respect to one or more commodities or operating regions or other events that could negatively impact our operational efficiency any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

we transport hazardous materials – we transport certain hazardous materials and other materials including crude oil ethanol and toxic inhalation hazard tih materials such as chlorine that pose certain risks in the event of a release or combustion additionally us laws impose common carrier obligations on railroads that require us to transport certain hazardous materials regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss a rail accident or other incident or accident on our network at our facilities or at the facilities of our customers involving the release or combustion of hazardous materials could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury property damage and environmental penalties and remediation in excess of our insurance coverage for these risks which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

we are subject to significant governmental regulation – we are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal state and local authorities covering a variety of health safety labor environmental economic as discussed below and other matters many laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses permits and other authorizations and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us governments or regulators may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate without providing us any recourse to address any adverse effects on our business including without limitation regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution increasing the amount of our traffic subject to common carrier regulation business relationships with other railroads calculation of our cost of capital or other inputs relevant to computing our revenue adequacy the prices we charge and costs and expenses significant legislative activity in congress or regulatory activity by the stb could expand regulation of railroad operations and prices for rail services which could reduce capital spending on our rail network facilities and equipment and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity as part of the rail safety improvement act of 2008 rail carriers were to implement ptc by the end of 2015 the rail safety improvement act the surface transportation extension act of 2015 amended the rail safety improvement act to require implementation of ptc by the end of 2018 which deadline may be extended to december 31 2020 provided certain other criteria are satisfied on december 10 2018 we received approval from the fra for an alternative schedule to implement test and refine our ptc during 20192020 final implementation of ptc will require us to adapt and integrate our system with other railroads whose implementation plan may be different than ours this implementation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition additionally one or more consolidations of class i railroads could also lead to increased regulation of the rail industry 

﻿ 

we may be affected by general economic conditions – prolonged severe adverse domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of financial and credit markets may affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry and may have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity and our results of operations and financial condition 

﻿ 

we face competition from other railroads and other transportation providers – we face competition from other railroads motor carriers ships barges and pipelines in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system while trucks barges and maritime operators are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation or legislation that eliminates or significantly increases the size or weight limitations currently applicable to motor carriers could have a material adverse 

 

effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect the competitive environment in which we operate 

﻿ 

we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations – we rely on information technology in all aspects of our business if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if we are unable to develop or implement new technology such as ptc or the latest version of our transportation control systems we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally if a cyber attack or other event causes significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment we could suffer a significant service interruption safety failure security breach or other operational difficulties which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures – as a railroad with operations in densely populated urban areas and other cities and a vast rail network we are exposed to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage environmental liability and other matters any material changes to litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving any or all of property damage personal injury and environmental liability that exceed our insurance coverage for such risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

we are subject to significant environmental laws and regulations – due to the nature of the railroad business our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waters handling storage transportation disposal of waste and other materials and hazardous material or petroleum releases we generate and transport hazardous and nonhazardous waste in our operations and we did so in our former operations environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties leased properties and properties owned by third parties as well as to properties we currently own environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation we have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated or are strictly liable under these laws or regulations we currently have certain obligations at existing sites for investigation remediation and monitoring and we likely will have obligations at other sites in the future liabilities for these obligations affect our estimate based on our experience and as necessary the advice and assistance of our consultants however actual costs may vary from our estimates due to any or all of several factors including changes to environmental laws or interpretations of such laws technological changes affecting investigations and remediation the participation and financial viability of other parties responsible for any such liability and the corrective action or change to corrective actions required to remediate any existing or future sites we could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

we may be affected by climate change and market or regulatory responses to climate change – climate change including the impact of global warming could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gasses including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating costs restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that a use commodities that we carry to produce energy b use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry or c manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels including chemical producers farmers and food producers and automakers and other manufacturers significant cost increases government regulation or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns including for example increasing royalties charged to producers of prb coal by the us department of interior and the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers finally we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change any of these factors individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors or 

 

other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures – as a railroad with a vast network we are exposed to severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods mudslides or landslides extreme temperatures and significant precipitation line outages and other interruptions caused by these conditions can adversely affect our entire rail network and can adversely affect revenue costs and liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations – the us class i railroads are party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions the majority of our employees belong to labor unions and are subject to these agreements disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in among other things strikes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts which could cause a significant disruption of our operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could compromise our service reliability or significantly increase our costs for health care wages and other benefits which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity labor disputes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts at loadingunloading facilities ports or other transport access points could compromise our service reliability and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity labor disputes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts by employees of our customers or our suppliers could compromise our service reliability and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

the availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations – changes in demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to meet demand for rail service unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

we may be affected by fluctuating fuel prices – fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses diesel fuel prices can be subject to dramatic fluctuations and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results although we currently are able to recover a significant amount of our fuel expenses from our customers through revenue from fuel surcharges we cannot be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elevated fuel costs through our fuel surcharges additionally future market conditions or legislative or regulatory activities could adversely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharges or adequately recover increased fuel costs through fuel surcharges as fuel prices fluctuate our fuel surcharge programs trail such fluctuations in fuel price by approximately two months and may be a significant source of quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear volatility particularly in periods of rapidly changing prices international political and economic factors events and conditions affect the volatility of fuel prices and supplies weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity a severe shortage of or disruption to domestic fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity alternatively lower fuel prices could have a positive impact on the economy by increasing consumer discretionary spending that potentially could increase demand for various consumer products we transport however lower fuel prices could have a negative impact on other commodities we transport such as coal and domestic drillingrelated shipments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

we utilize capital markets – due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements we utilize longterm debt instruments bank financing and commercial paper from timetotime and we pledge certain of our receivables significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets including the credit markets or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to and significantly increase the cost of commercial paper and other financing sources including bank credit facilities and the issuance of longterm debt including corporate bonds a significant deterioration of our financial condition could result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade which could restrict or at certain credit levels below investment grade may prohibit us from utilizing our current receivables securitization facility this may also limit our access to external sources of capital and significantly increase the costs of short and longterm debt financing 

 

a significant portion of our revenue involves transportation of commodities to and from international markets – although revenues from our operations are attributable to transportation services provided in the us a significant portion of our revenues involves the transportation of commodities to and from international markets including mexico and southeast asia by various carriers and at times various modes of transportation significant and sustained interruptions of trade with mexico or countries in southeast asia including china could adversely affect customers and other entities that directly or indirectly purchase or rely on rail transportation services in the us as part of their operations and any such interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity any one or more of the following could cause a significant and sustained interruption of trade with mexico or countries in southeast asia a a deterioration of security for international trade and businesses b the adverse impact of new laws rules and regulations or the interpretation of laws rules and regulations by government entities courts or regulatory bodies including modifications to the north american free trade agreement nafta or its proposed successor called the usmexicocanada agreement usmca and actions of taxing authorities that affect our customers doing business in foreign countries c any significant adverse economic developments such as extended periods of high inflation material disruptions in the banking sector or in the capital markets of these foreign countries and significant changes in the valuation of the currencies of these foreign countries that could materially affect the cost or value of imports or exports d shifts in patterns of international trade that adversely affect import and export markets and e a material reduction in foreign direct investment in these countries 

﻿ 

we are subject to legislative regulatory and legal developments involving taxes – taxes are a significant part of our expenses we are subject to us federal state and foreign income payroll property sales and use fuel and other types of taxes changes in tax rates such as those included in the us tax cuts and jobs act enactment of new tax laws revisions of tax regulations and claims or litigation with taxing authorities could result in a material effect to our results of operations financial condition and liquidity higher tax rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

we are dependent on certain key suppliers of locomotives and rail – due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment parts and maintenance potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry therefore if one of the domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives discontinues manufacturing locomotives supplying parts or providing maintenance for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience significant cost increases and reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary for our operations additionally for a high percentage of our rail purchases we utilize two steel producers one domestic and one international that meet our specifications rail is critical to our operations for rail replacement programs maintenance and for adding additional network capacity new rail and storage yards and expansions of existing facilities this industry similarly has high barriers to entry and if one of these suppliers discontinues operations for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience both significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail for maintenance and other projects 

﻿ 

we may be affected by acts of terrorism war or risk of war – our rail lines facilities and equipment including rail cars carrying hazardous materials could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks terrorist attacks or other similar events any government response thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in addition insurance premiums for some or all of our current coverages could increase dramatically or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future

property and depreciation – our railroad operations are highly capital intensive and our large base of homogeneous networktype assets turns over on a continuous basis each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated service lives which are measured in years except for rail in highdensity traffic corridors ie all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment and yard and switching tracks for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics use and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources not as singular items we currently have more than 60 depreciable asset classes and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology asset strategies or other factors 

﻿ 

we determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad assets by means of depreciation studies we perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets ie rail and other track material ties and ballast and other road property our depreciation studies take into account the following factors 

﻿ 









﻿ 

for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track it has been our experience that the lives of rail in highdensity traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage ie the amount of weight carried over the rail the service lives also vary based on rail weight rail condition eg new or secondhand and rail type eg straight or curve our depreciation studies for rail in highdensity traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross tonmiles carried over the rail ie the weight of loaded and empty freight cars locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile for all other depreciable assets we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively 

 

under group depreciation the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated by multiplying the current replacement cost of track assets by a historical index factor derived from i inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ii the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate in addition we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies any deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets 

﻿ 

for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions i is unusual ii is material in amount and iii varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations 

﻿ 

when we purchase an asset we capitalize all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use however many of our assets are selfconstructed a large portion of our capital expenditures is for replacement of existing track assets and other road properties which is typically performed by our employees and for track line expansion and other capacity projects costs that are directly attributable to capital projects including overhead costs are capitalized direct costs that are capitalized as part of selfconstructed assets include material labor and work equipment indirect costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset 

﻿ 

normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred while costs incurred that extend the useful life of an asset improve the safety of our operations or improve operating efficiency are capitalized these costs are allocated using appropriate statistical bases total expense for repairs and maintenance incurred was 25 billion for 2018 25 billion for 2017 and 23 billion for 2016 

﻿ 

assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease amortization expense is computed using the straightline method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease

14 financial instruments 

﻿ 

shortterm investments – all of the company’s shortterm investments consist of time deposits and government agency securities these investments are considered level 2 investments and are valued at amortized cost which approximates fair value on november 1 2018 30 million of the company’s 90 million in shortterm investments were placed into a trust for the purpose of providing collateral for payment of certain other longterm liabilities and as such were reclassified as other assets all shortterm investments have a maturity of less than one year and are classified as heldtomaturity there were no transfers out of level 2 during the year ended december 31 2018 

 

fair value of financial instruments – the fair value of our short and longterm debt was estimated using a market value price model which utilizes applicable us treasury rates along with current market quotes on comparable debt securities all of the inputs used to determine the fair market value of the corporation’s longterm debt are level 2 inputs and obtained from an independent source at december 31 2018 the fair value of total debt was 219 billion approximately 05 billion less than the carrying value at december 31 2017 the fair value of total debt was 182 billion approximately 13 billion more than the carrying value the fair value of the corporation’s debt is a measure of its current value under present market conditions it does not impact the financial statements under current accounting rules at december 31 2018 and 2017 approximately 0 and 155 million respectively of debt securities contained call provisions that allow us to retire the debt instruments prior to final maturity at par without the payment of fixed call premiums the fair value of our cash equivalents approximates their carrying value due to the shortterm maturities of these instruments

﻿ 

equipment encumbrances – equipment with a carrying value of approximately 18 billion and 20 billion at december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively served as collateral for capital leases and other types of equipment obligations in accordance with the secured financing arrangements utilized to acquire or refinance such railroad equipment 

﻿ 

debt redemption – effective as of march 15 2018 we redeemed in entirety the missouri pacific 5 income debentures due 2045 the chicago and eastern illinois 5 income debentures due 2054 and the missouri pacific 475 general mortgage income bonds series a due 2020 and series b due 2030 the debentures had principal outstanding of 96 million and 2 million respectively and the bonds had principal outstanding of 30 million and 27 million respectively the bonds and debentures were assumed by the railroad in the 1982 acquisition of the missouri pacific railroad company with a weighted average interest rate of 49 the carrying value of all four bonds and debentures at the time of redemption was 70 million 

 

due to fair value purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition the redemption resulted in an early extinguishment charge of 85 million in the first quarter of 2018 

﻿ 

credit facilities – during the second quarter of 2018 we replaced our 17 billion revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in may 2019 with a new 20 billion facility that expires in june 2023 the facility the facility is based on substantially similar terms as those in the previous credit facility at december 31 2018  we had 20 billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility which is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper we did not draw on either facility at any time during 2018 commitment fees and in terest rates payable under the f ac ility are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investmentgrade borrowers the facility allows for borrowings at floating rates based on london interbank offered rates plus a spread depending upon credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt the prior facility required upc to maintain a debttonetworth coverage ratio the new fiveyear facility requires upc to maintain a debttoebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization coverage ratio

the definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the debttoebitda coverage ratio includes among other things certain credit arrangements capital leases guarantees unfunded and vested pension benefits under title iv of erisa and unamortized debt discount and deferred debt issuance costs at december 31 2018  the company was in compliance with the debttoebitda coverage ratio which allows us to carry up to 379 billion of debt a s defined in the f acility and we had 232 billion of debt as defined in the facility outstanding at that date the facility does not include any other financial restrictions credit rating triggers other than ratingdependent pricing or any other provision that could require us to post collateral the facility also includes a 150 million cross default provision and a changeofcontrol provision 

﻿ 

during 2018 we issued 85 billion and repaid 83 billion of commercial paper with maturities ranging from 1 to 34 days and at december 31 2018 and 2 017 we had 200 million and 0 commercial paper outstanding respectively our revolving credit facility supports our outstanding commercial paper balances and unless we change the terms of our commercial paper program our aggregate issuance of commercial paper will not exceed the amount of borrowings available under the facility 

﻿ 

in may 2018 we entered into a shortterm bilateral line of credit agreement with 10 billion of credit available during the three months ended june 30 2018 we drew and repaid 750 million the line of credit matured in august 2018 we used the proceeds for general corporate purposes including the repurchase of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase programs 

﻿ 

shelf registration statement and significant new borrowings – we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec that became effective on february 12 2018 the shelf the board of directors authorized the issuance of up to 6 billion of debt securities replacing the prior board authorization in july 2016 which had 155 billion of authority remaining under our shelf registration we may issue from time to time any combination of debt securities preferred stock common stock or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings 

﻿ 

during 2018 we issued the following unsecured fixedrate debt securities under our current shelf registration 

﻿ 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

we used the net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes including the repurchase of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase programs these debt securities include changeofcontrol provisions    

﻿ 

on july 26 2018 the board of directors renewed its authorization for the company to issue up to 60 billion of debt securities under the shelf this authorization replaces the original board authorization in

16 variable interest entities 

﻿ 

we have entered into various lease transactions in which the structure of the leases contain variable interest entities vies these vies were created solely for the purpose of doing lease transactions principally involving railroad equipment and facilities and have no other activities assets or liabilities outside of the lease transactions within these lease arrangements we have the right to purchase some or all of the assets at fixed prices depending on market conditions fixedprice purchase options available in the leases could potentially provide benefits to us however these benefits are not expected to be significant 

﻿ 

we maintain and operate the assets based on contractual obligations within the lease arrangements which set specific guidelines consistent within the railroad industry as such we have no control over activities that could materially impact the fair value of the leased assets we do not hold the power to direct the activities of the vies and therefore do not control the ongoing activities that have a significant impact on the economic performance of the vies additionally we do not have the obligation to absorb losses of the vies or the right to receive benefits of the vies that could potentially be significant to the vies 

﻿ 

we are not considered to be the primary beneficiary and do not consolidate these vies because our actions and decisions do not have the most significant effect on the vie’s performance and our fixedprice purchase options are not considered to be potentially significant to the vies the future minimum lease payments associated with the vie leases totaled 17 billion as of december 31 2018  

  

17 leases 

﻿ 

we lease certain locomotives freight cars and other property the consolidated statements of financial position as of december 31 2018 and 2017 included   1454 million net of 912   million of accumulated depreciation and 1635 million net of 953 million of accumulated depreciation respectively for properties held under capital leases a charge to income resulting from the depreciation for assets held under capital leases is included within depreciation expense in our consolidated statements of income future minimum lease payments for operating and capital leases with initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of december 31 2018  were as follows 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

approximately 97 of capital lease payments relate to locomotives rent expense for operating leases with terms exceeding one month was 397 million in 2018 480 million in 2017 and 535 million in 2016 when cash rental payments are not made on a straightline basis we recognize variable rental expense on a straightline basis over the lease term contingent rentals and subrentals are not significant 

  

18 commitments and contingencies 

﻿ 

asserted and unasserted claims – various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries we cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity to the extent possible we have recorded 

 

a liability where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated we do not expect that any known lawsuits claims environmental costs commitments contingent liabilities or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters 

﻿ 

personal injury – the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability including unasserted claims the federal employers’ liability act fela governs compensation for workrelated accidents under fela damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or outofcourt settlements we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 

﻿ 

our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments approximately 94 of the recorded liability is related to asserted claims and approximately 6 is related to unasserted claims at december 31 2018  because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 271 million to 297 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation 

﻿ 

our personal injury liability activity was as follows 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

we reassess our estimated insurance recoveries annually and have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2018 and 2017  any changes to recorded insurance recoveries are included in the above table in the changes in estimates for prior years category 

﻿ 

environmental costs – we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations we ha ve identified 334 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements this includes 33 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government 21 of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 

﻿ 

when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in our business we perform with assistance of our consultants environmental assessments on the property we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated our environmental liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments 

﻿ 

our environmental liability activity was as follows 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

 

the environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties cost estimates are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and existing technology laws and regulations the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties sitespecific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal state and local laws governing environmental remediation current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

﻿ 

insurance – the company has a consolidated whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary the captive that provides insurance coverage for certain risks including fela claims and property coverage which are subject to reinsurance the captive entered into annual reinsurance treaty agreements that insure workers compensation general liability auto liability and fela risk the captive cedes a portion of its fela exposure through the treaty and assumes a proportionate share of the entire risk the captive receives direct premiums which are netted against the company’s premium costs in other expenses in the consolidated statements of income the treaty agreements provide for certain protections against the risk of treaty participants’ nonperformance and we do not believe our exposure to treaty participants’ nonperformance is material at this time we record both liabilities and reinsurance receivables using an actuarial analysis based on historical experience in our consolidated statements of financial position effective january 2019 the captive insurance subsidiary will no longer participate in the reinsurance treaty agreement the company established a trust in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the purpose of providing collateral as required under the reinsurance treaty agreement for prior years’ participation 

﻿ 

guarantees – at december 31 2018 and 2017  we were contingently liable for 22 million and 33 million respectively in guarantees the fair value of these obligations as of both december 31 2018 and 2017   was 0  we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business and they include guaranteed obligations related to our affiliated operations the final guarantee expires in 2022 we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

﻿ 

indemnities – we are contingently obligated under a variety of indemnification arrangements although in some cases the extent of our potential liability is limited depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions 

﻿ 

gain contingency – uprr filed multiple claims with the irs for refunds of railroad retirement taxes railroad retirement taxes paid on i certain stock awards to its employees and ii certain bonus payments it made to labor agreement employees during the years 1991 – 2017 in 2016 the us district court for the district of nebraska the district court denied uprr recovery of these railroad retirement taxes uprr appealed this denial to the us court of appeals for the 8th circuit 8th circuit and the 8th circuit ruled in favor of uprr and remanded the case to the district court the irs appealed the 8th circuit ruling to the us supreme court in june 2018 a similar case for another railroad was decided by the us supreme court against the irs and in favor of that railroad  wisconsin central ltd et al v us  as a result the us supreme court denied the irs request to appeal the 8th circuit ruling on november 28 2018 the district court issued an order granting summary judgment to uprr pursuant to the mandate of the 8th circuit uprr the department of justice doj and the irs have since agreed upon the tax refund amounts owed uprr and its employees uprr’s employer refund of 78 million will be recognized as a reduction of compensation and benefit expenses and approximately 30 million of interest will be recognized in other income uprr expects to receive the refunds in 2019 but the refunds may be received in multiple portions at different times uprr is in the process of seeking consent from approximately 75000 current and former employees to obtain their employee share of the refunds uprr anticipates having this consent process completed in the first half of 2019 but further actions by the irs and railroad retirement board may delay completion until later in 2019 

﻿ 

these refund claims are considered gain contingencies and no refund amounts have been recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2018 the claims will be recorded when a final 

 

judgment from the district court has been issued and all irs requirements for uprr’s refunds have been fulfilled

lower fuel prices could have a positive impact on the economy by increasing consumer discretionary spending that potentially could increase demand for various consumer products that we transport alternatively lower fuel prices could likely have a negative impact on other commodities such as coal and domestic drillingrelated shipments

operating revenues 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

we generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our four commodity groups freight revenues vary with volume carloads and average revenue per car arc changes in price traffic mix and fuel surcharges drive arc we provide some of our customers with contractual incentives for meeting or exceeding specified cumulative volumes or shipping to and from specific locations which we record as reductions to freight revenues based on the actual or projected future shipments we recognize freight revenues as shipments move from origin to destination we allocate freight revenues between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them 

﻿ 

other revenues include revenues earned by our subsidiaries revenues from commuter rail operations that we manage accessorial revenues which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us or when we perform additional services such as switching or storage and miscellaneous contract revenue we recognize other revenues as we perform services or meet contractual obligations 

﻿ 

freight revenues increased 8 yearoveryear to 214 billion driven by 4 volume growth higher fuel surcharge revenue and core pricing gains partially offset by negative mix of traffic growth in international 

 

and domestic intermodal petroleum products metals rock plastics and industrial chemical shipments more than offset declines in coal grain and frac sand shipments 

﻿ 

freight revenues increased 7 in 2017 to 198 billion driven by volume growth of 2 higher fuel surcharge revenue and core pricing gains growth in frac sand coal and intermodal shipments more than offset declines in grain crude oil finished vehicles and rock shipments 

﻿ 

our fuel surcharge programs generated freight revenues of 17 billion 966 million and 560 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively fuel surcharge revenue in 2018 increased 769 million as a result of a 27 increase in fuel price and 4 growth in carloadings fuel surcharge revenue in 2017 increased 406 million as a result of a 22 increase in fuel price a 2 growth in carloadings and the lag impact on fuel surcharge it can generally take up to two months for changing fuel prices to affect fuel surcharge recoveries 

﻿ 

in 2018 other revenues increased from 2017 driven by higher accessorial revenues associated with carload and container volume growth 

﻿ 

in 2017 other revenues increased from 2016 due to higher revenues at our subsidiaries primarily those that broker intermodal transload and refrigerated warehousing logistics services 

﻿ 

the following tables summarize the yearoveryear changes in freight revenues revenue carloads and arc by commodity type 

﻿

﻿ 

 



freight revenue fr om agricultural products   increased in 2017 compared to 2016 driven by core pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by a 1 decrease in volume grain and grain product shipments decreased 3 in 2017 compared to 2016 strong export demand for wheat drove volume growth in the first half of the year which was more than offset by declines of grain shipments in the second half of the year due to an abundance of global supply reducing us grain competitiveness conversely fertilizer shipments increased 7 as a result of continued strength in potash exports 

﻿ 



volume growth of 11 and higher fuel surcharge revenue drove an increase in freight revenue from energy shipments in 2017 compared to 2016 shipments out of the powder river basin prb grew 5 driven by strong growth in the first half of the year due to higher yearoveryear natural gas prices and lower inventory levels at utilities shipments out of colorado and utah increased 7 compared to 2016 due to the same drivers combined with stronger export demand in addition increased shale drilling activity and proppant intensity per drilling well drove substantial volume growth in frac sand shipments versus 2016 

﻿ 



 

volumes were flat as growth in shipments of metals waste and government shipments were offset by declines in construction materials due to inclement weather in the west in the first half of the year combined with decreased construction activity in texas and lower industrial chemical shipments

higher fuel surcharge revenue and core pricing gains drove an increase in freight revenue from premium shipments in 2017 compared to 2016 volumes were flat as a 1 growth in international shipments was muted by flat domestic shipments including containerized automotive parts due to available truck capacity during most of 2017 which offset a strong holiday shipping season in the fourth quarter in addition shipments of finished vehicles fell 7 in 2017 resulting from lower domestic sales and reduced production for certain manufactures 

  

mexico business – each of our commodity groups includes revenue from shipments to and from mexico freight revenue from mexico business was 25 billion in 2018 up 10 compared to 2017 driven by 1 volume growth fuel surcharge revenue and core pricing gains the increase in volume was driven by higher shipments of corn and feed grains coal and finished vehicles partially offset by declines in automotive parts and intermodal shipments 

﻿ 

freight revenue from mexico business was 23 billion in 2017 up 2 compared to 2016 core pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue more than offset the 1 volume decline the decrease in volume was driven by lower shipments of automotive parts partially offset by growth in coal and refined petroleum products shipments

﻿ 

equipment and other rents – equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies freight car intermodal and locomotive leases and office and other rent expenses equity income from certain equity method investments is also included equipment and other rents expense increased 184 million compared to 2017 largely driven by a 212 million reduction to 2017 rent expense related to income tax adjustments at certain equitymethod affiliates   as a result of the lower federal tax rate implemented january 1 2018  i ncreased car rent expense due to volume growth and slower network velocity also contributed to the increase lower locomotive and freight car lease expense s in 2018 partially offset these increases   

﻿ 

equipment and other rents expense decreased 249 million compared to 2016 212 million of the reduction was due to income tax adjustments at certain equitymethod affiliates lower locomotive and freight car lease expense also contributed to the yearoveryear decrease conversely increased car rent expense due to volume growth in certain markets partially offset these decreases 

﻿ 

other – other expenses include state and local taxes freight equipment and property damage utilities insurance personal injury environmental employee travel telephone and cellular computer software bad debt and other general expenses other expenses increased 8 in 2018 compared to 2017 as a result of higher state and local taxes and environmental expenses related to our operating properties lower personal injury expense an insurance reimbursement for lost revenue and expenses incurred during hurricane harvey in 2017 and reduced costs for destroyed equipment owned by third parties and lower freight damage expense p artially offset these inc reases

average train speed – average train speed is calculated by dividing train miles by hours operated on our main lines between terminals average train speed as reported to the aar declined   4  in 2018 compared to 2017 largely driven by network congestion on key routes and terminals combined with high freight car inventory levels during the first half o f the year  somewhat offset by implementation of the first phase of our unified plan 2020 in late third quarter 2018 continued implementation and t esting of ptc across a larger portion of our network also negatively impacted overall average train speed throughout the year  

﻿ 

average train speed declined 5 in 2017 compared to 2016 as disruptions across our network including the impact of hurricane harvey negatively impacted network fluidity continued implementation and testing of positive train control across a growing number of routes in our network combined with operational challenges also negatively impacted overall average train speed

liquidity and capital resources 

﻿ 

at december 31 2018 we had a working capital deficit at december 31 2017 we had a working capital surplus the deficit at 2018 yearend was primarily due to an increase in upcoming debt maturities as past years indicate it is not unusual for us to have a working capital deficit however we believe it is not an indication of a lack of liquidity we also maintain adequate resources including our credit facility and when necessary access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements 

﻿ 

as of december 31 2018  our principal sources of liquidity included cash cash equivalents our receivables securitization facility and our revolving credit facility as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets we had 20 billion of committed credit available under our credit facility with no borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2018 we did not draw on our   current facility or previous facility at any time during 2018 the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the 650 million capacity receivables securitization facility was 400 million as of   december 31 2018  our access to this receivables securitization facility may be reduced or restricted if our bond ratings fall to certain levels below investment grade if our bond rating were to deteriorate it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financings is dependent on market conditions deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability we expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity through any or all of the following sources or activities i increasing the size or utilization of our receivables securitization ii issuing commercial paper iii entering into bank loans outside of our revolving credit facility or iv issuing bonds or other debt securities to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets the company’s 20 billion revolving credit facility is intended to support the issuance of commercial paper by upc and also serves as an additional source of liquidity to fund short term needs  the company currently does not intend to make any borrowings under this facility 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

operating activities 

﻿ 

cash provided by operating activities increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due primarily to lower federal income tax payments 

  

cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the timing of tax payments in 2016 related to bonus depreciation on capital spending the decrease was mostly offset by higher income in 2017 compared to 2016 

﻿ 

the tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 the tax act extended 100 bonus depreciation effective september 27 2017 through 2022 and phases out bonus deprecation by 2027

﻿ 

capital plan – in 2019 we expect our capital plan to be approximately 32 billion  which may be revised if business conditions or the regulatory environment affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments while asset replacements will fluctuate as part of our renewal strategy we expect to use 75 to 80 of our capital investments to renew and improve existing capital assets we will continue to balance investment in our network infrastructure and terminal capacity as appropriate including new capacity investment s designed to support future business growth and operational efficiency significant investments will be made for locomotive modernization and freight cars 

﻿ 

we expect to fund our 2019 cash capital plan by using some or all of the following cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and cash on hand our annual capital plan is a critical component of our longterm strategic plan we expect our plan will enhance the longterm value of the company for our shareholders by providing sufficient resources to i replace and improve our existing track infrastructure to provide safe and fluid operations ii increase network efficiency by adding or improving facilities and track and iii make investments that meet customer demand and take advantage of opportunities for longterm growth 

  

financing activities 

﻿ 

cash used in financing activities increased in 2018 compared to 2017 increases of 4212 million in share repurchase programs 317 million in dividends paid and 896 million in debt repaid more than offset increases of 415 7 million in debt issued and 194 million in net issuance s of commercial paper 

﻿ 

cash used in financing activities decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 an increase of 908 million in common shares purchased and an increase of 103 million in dividends paid was more than offset by an increase of 752 million in debt issued a decrease of 173 million in debt repaid and a decrease of 191 million in debt exchange costs 

﻿ 

see note 15 of the consolidated financial statements for a description of all our outstanding financing arrangements and significant new borrowings 

 

share repurchase programs 

﻿ 

effective january 1 2017 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 120 million shares of our common stock by december 31 2020 replacing our previous repurchase program as of december 31 2018 we repurchased a total of 31 4 billion of our common stock since the commencement of our repurchase programs in 2007 the table below represents shares repurchased in 2018 under this repurchase program 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 





﻿ 

managements assessments of market conditions and other pertinent facts guide the timing and volume of all repurchases we expect to fund any share repurchases under this program through cash generated from operations the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties debt issuances and cash on hand open market repurchases are recorded in treasury stock at cost which includes any applicable commissions and fees 

﻿ 

from january 1 2019 through february 7 2019 we repurchased 34 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately 521 million 

﻿ 

on february 7 2019 the board of directors approved a new share repurchase authorization enabling the company to buy up to 150 million of its common shares by march 31 2022 the new authorization is effective april 1 2019 and replaces the current authorization which will now expire on march 31 2019 

﻿ 

accelerated share repurchase programs – on june 14 2018 the company established accelerated share repurchase programs asrs with two financial institutions to repurchase shares of our common stock under these asrs we paid a prespecified amount of 36 billion and received an initial delivery of 19870292 shares on june 15 2018 upon settlement of the asrs we received 4457356 additional shares in the fourth quarter of 2018 the final number of shares repurchased under the asrs was based on the volume weighted average stock price of the company’s common stock during the asr term  less a negotiated discount   

﻿ 

asrs are accounted for as equity transactions and at the time of receipt shares are included in treasury stock at fair market value as of the corresponding initiation or settlement date the company reflects shares received as a repurchase of common stock in the weighted average common shares outstanding calculation for basic and diluted earnings per share 

﻿ 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

﻿ 

as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and as referenced in the tables below we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments including material sources of offbalance sheet and structured finance arrangements other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets as described in item 1a of part ii of this report there is no known trend demand commitment event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition our commercial obligations financings and commitments are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations particularly within the transportation industry 

﻿ 

 

the following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of december 31 2018

offbalance sheet arrangements 

﻿ 

guarantees – at december 31 2018 and 2017  we were contingent ly liable for  22 million and 3 3 million in guarantees the fair value of these obligations as of both december 31 2018 and 2017  was 0 we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business and they include guaranteed obligations related to our affiliated operations the final guarantee expires in 2022 we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

other matters 

﻿ 

labor agreements – approximately 85 of our fulltime employees are represented by 14 major rail unions  pursuant to the railway labor act rla our collective bargaining agreements are subject to modification every five years the most recent round of negotiations started on january 1 2015 and throughout 2017 and 2018 we concluded new agreements with all 14 major rail unions existing agreements remain in effect until new agreements are ratified or until the rla procedures are exhausted the rla procedures include mediation potential arbitration coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential emergency boards and congressional intervention the next round of negotiations begins with the service of rla section 6 notice s on or about november 1 2019 related to years 20192023 contract 

 

negotiations historically continue for an extended period of time and work stoppages during negotiations are rare 

﻿ 

inflation – long periods of inflation significantly increase asset replacement costs for capitalintensive companies as a result assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels depreciation charges on an inflationadjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 

﻿ 

sensitivity analyses – the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 

﻿ 

at december 31 2018  we had variablerate debt representing approximately 38 of our total debt if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2019 than our december 31 2018 variable rate which was approximately 33 our interest expense would increase by approximately 85 million  this amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balances of our variablerate debt at december 31 2018  

﻿ 

market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2018 and amounts to an increase of approximately 24 billion to the fair value of our debt at december 31 2018  we estimated the fair values of our fixedrate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 

﻿ 

accounting pronouncements – see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

﻿ 

asserted and unasserted claims – various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries we cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity to the extent possible we have recorded a liability where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated we do not expect that any known lawsuits claims environmental costs commitments contingent liabilities or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters 

﻿ 

gain contingency – uprr filed multiple claims with the irs for refunds of railroad retirement taxes railroad retirement taxes paid on i certain stock awards to its employees and ii certain bonus payments it made to labor agreement employees during the years 1991 – 2017 in 2016 the us district court for the district of nebraska the district court denied uprr recovery of these railroad retirement taxes uprr appealed this denial to the us court of appeals for the 8th circuit 8th circuit and the 8th circuit ruled in favor of uprr and remanded the case to the district court the irs appealed the 8th circuit ruling to the us supreme court in june 2018 a similar case for another railroad was decided by the us supreme court against the irs and in favor of that railroad  wisconsin central ltd et al v us  as a result the us supreme court denied the irs request to appeal the 8th circuit ruling on november 28 2018 the district court issued an order granting summary judgment to uprr pursuant to the mandate of the 8th circuit uprr the department of justice doj and the irs have since agreed upon the tax refund amounts owed uprr and its employees uprr’s employer refund of 78 million will be recognized as a reduction of compensation and benefit expenses and approximately 30 million of interest will be recognized in other income uprr expects to receive the refunds in 2019 but the refunds may be received in multiple portions at different times uprr is in the process of seeking consent from approximately 75000 current and former employees to obtain their employee share of the refunds uprr anticipates having this consent process completed in the first half of 2019 but further actions by the irs and railroad retirement board may delay completion until later in 2019 

﻿ 

these refund claims are considered gain contingencies and no refund amounts have been recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2018 the claims will be recorded when a final judgment from the district court has been issued and all irs requirements for uprr’s refunds have been fulfilled 

﻿ 

indemnities – our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements including certain tax indemnifications can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate 

 

any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions 

﻿ 

climate change – although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item 1a of this report we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact however we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment including investments in new technologies using training programs to reduce fuel consumption and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency 

  

cr itical accounting policies 

﻿ 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 2 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 these critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 

﻿ 

personal injury – the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability including unasserted claims the federal employers’ liability act fela governs compensation for workrelated accidents under fela damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or outofcourt settlements we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 

﻿ 

our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments approximately 94 of the recorded liability is related to asserted claims and approximately 6 is related to unasserted claims at december 31 2018 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 271 million to 297 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation 

﻿ 

our personal injury liability activity was as follows

we reassess our estimated insurance recoveries annually and have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2018 and 2017  any changes to recorded insurance recoveries are included in the above table in the changes in estimates for prior years category 

﻿ 

environmental costs – we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations we have identified 334 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements this includes 33 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government 21 of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 

﻿ 

when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in our business we perform with assistance of our consultants environmental assessments on the property we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated our environmental liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments

the environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties cost estimates are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and existing technology laws and regulations the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties sitespecific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal state and local laws governing environmental remediation current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity

property and depreciation – our railroad operations are highly capital intensive and our large base of homogeneous networktype assets turns over on a continuous basis each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated service lives which are measured in years except for rail in highdensity traffic corridors ie all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment and yard and switching tracks for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics use and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources not as singular items we currently have more than 60 depreciable asset classes and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology asset strategies or other factors 

 

we determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property by means of depreciation studies we perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets ie rail and other track material ties and ballast and other road property our depreciation studies take into account the following factors 

﻿ 









﻿ 

for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track it has been our experience that the lives of rail in highdensity traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage ie the amount of weight carried over the rail the service lives also vary based on rail weight rail condition eg new or secondhand and rail type eg straight or curve our depreciation studies for rail in highdensity traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross tonmiles carried over the rail ie the weight of loaded and empty freight cars locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile rail in highdensity traffic corridors accounts for approximately 70 percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material based on the number of gross tonmiles carried over our rail in high density traffic corridors during 2018 the estimated service lives of the majority of this rail ranged from approximately 19 years to approximately 41 years  for all other depreciable assets we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively 

﻿ 

estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to changes in physical use technology asset strategies and other factors that will have an impact on the retirement profiles of our assets we are not aware of any specific factors that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service lives of our assets actual use and retirement of our assets may vary from our current estimates which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future periods 

﻿ 

changes in estimated useful lives of our assets due to the results of our depreciation studies could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately 70 million if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable asset s were decreased by one year annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately 75 million our 2018 depreciation studies have resulted in lower depreciation rates for some asset classes these lower rates will partially offset the impact of a projected higher depreciable asset base resulting in an increase in total depreciation expense by approximately 3 in 2019 versus 2018 

﻿ 

under group depreciation the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated by multiplying the current replacement cost of track assets by a historical index factor derived from i inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ii the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate in addition we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies any deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets 

﻿ 

for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions i it is unusual ii it is material in amount and iii it varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies during the last three fiscal years no gains or losses were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad properties a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations 

 

income taxes – we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns these expected future tax consequences are measured based on current tax law the effects of future tax legislation are not anticipated future tax legislation such as a change in the corporate tax rate could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity for example a permanent 1 increase in future income tax rates would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately 450 million similarly a permanent 1 decrease in future income tax rates would decrease our deferred tax liability by approximately 450 million 

﻿ 

when appropriate we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reflect that these tax assets may not be realized in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized based on management’s judgments using available evidence for purposes of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize a deferred tax asset in 2018 and 2017 there were no valuation allowances 

﻿ 

we recognize tax benefits that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement a liability for “unrecognized tax benefits” is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards 

﻿ 

pension and other postretirement benefits – we use an actuarial analysis to measure the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and medical and life insurance benefits opeb to eligible employees in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make several assumptions the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rates and expected rate of return on pension assets for opeb the critical assumptions are the discount rates and health care cost trend rate 

﻿ 

we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually and selected assumptions are based on the following factors 

﻿ 







﻿ 

the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit for 2019 and the estimated impact on 2019 net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit relative to a change in those assumptions

manifest and premium business bulk traffic primarily consists of coal grain soda ash ethanol rock and crude oil shipped in unit trains – trains transporting a single commodity from one origin to one destination manifest traffic includes individual carload or less than trainload business involving commodities such as lumber steel paper food and chemicals the transportation of finished vehicles auto parts intermodal containers and truck trailers are included as part of our premium business in 2017 we generated freight revenues totaling 198 billion from the following six commodity groups 

﻿ 

agricultural products – transportation of grains commodities produced from these grains and food and beverage products generated 19 of the railroad’s 2017 freight revenue we access most major grain markets linking the midwest and western us producing areas to export terminals in the pacific northwest and gulf coast ports as well as mexico we also serve significant domestic markets including grain processors animal feeders and ethanol producers in the midwest west south and rocky mountain states unit trains which transport a single commodity between producers and export terminals or domestic markets represent approximately 41 of our agricultural shipments 

﻿ 

automotive – we are the largest automotive carrier west of the mississippi river and operate or access 38 vehicle distribution centers the railroad’s extensive franchise serves five vehicle assembly plants and connects to west coast ports all six major mexico gateways and the port of houston to accommodate both import and export shipments in addition to transporting finished vehicles uprr provides expedited handling of automotive parts in both boxcars and intermodal containers destined for mexico the us and canada the automotive group generated 10 of union pacific’s freight revenue in 2017 

﻿ 

chemicals – transporting chemicals generated 18 of our freight revenue in 2017 the railroad’s unique franchise serves the chemical producing areas along the gulf coast where roughly 5 5  of the company’s chemical business originates travels through or terminates our chemical franchise also accesses chemical producers in the rocky mountains and on the west coast the company’s chemical shipments include six categories industrial chemicals plastics fertilizer petroleum and liquid petroleum gases crude oil and soda ash currently these products move primarily to and from the gulf coast region fertilizer movements originate in the gulf coast region the western us and canada through interline access for delivery to major agricultural users in the midwest western us as well as abroad soda ash originates in southwestern wyoming and california destined for chemical and glass producing markets in north america and abroad 

﻿ 

coal – shipments of coal petroleum coke and biomass accounted for 13 of our freight revenue in 2017 the railroad’s network supports the transportation of coal petroleum coke and biomass to independent and regulated power companies and industrial facilities throughout the us through interchange gateways and ports uprr’s reach extends to eastern us utilities as well as to mexico and other international destinations coal traffic originating in the powder river basin prb area of wyoming is the largest segment of the railroad’s coal business 

﻿ 

industrial products – our extensive network facilitates the movement of numerous commodities between thousands of origin and destination points throughout north america the industrial products group consists of several categories including construction products minerals consumer goods metals lumber paper and other miscellaneous products in 2017 this group generated 21 of our total freight revenue commercial residential and governmental infrastructure investments drive shipments of steel aggregates cement components cement and wood products oil and gas drilling generates demand for raw steel finished pipe frac sand stone and drilling fluid commodities industrial and light manufacturing plants 

 

receive steel nonferrous materials minerals and other raw materials paper and packaging commodities as well as appliances move to major metropolitan areas for consumers lumber shipments originate primarily in the pacific northwest and western canada and move throughout the us for use in new home construction and repair and remodeling

﻿ 

seasonality – some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons reflecting either or both the nature of the commodity and the demand cycle for the commodity such as certain agricultural and food products that have specific growing and harvesting seasons the peak shipping seasons for these commodities can vary considerably each year depending upon various factors including the strength of domestic and international economies and currencies and the strength of harvests and market prices for agricultural products 

﻿ 

working capital – at december 31 2017 we had a working capital surplus we maintain adequate resources and when necessary have adequate access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements in addition to sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities at december 31 2016 we had a working capital deficit due primarily to a decrease in other current assets related to a tax receivable for the late extension of bonus depreciation at december 31 2015 along with an increase at december 31 2016 in accounts payable and upcoming debt maturities 

﻿ 

competition – we are subject to competition from other railroads motor carriers ship and barge operators and pipelines our main railroad competitor is burlington northern santa fe llc its primary subsidiary bnsf railway company bnsf operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors in addition we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers motor carrier competition exists for five of our six commodity groups excluding most coal shipments because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and gulf coast waterways barges can be particularly competitive especially for grain and bulk commodities in certain areas where we operate in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times quality and reliability of service from motor carriers and other railroads motor carriers in particular can have an advantage over railroads with respect to transit times and timeliness of service however railroads are much more fuelefficient than trucks which reduces the impact of transporting goods on the environment and public infrastructure and we have been making efforts to convert certain truck traffic to rail additionally we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any of the following could also affect the competitiveness of our transportation services for some or all of our commodities i improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation ii legislation that eliminates or significantly increases the size or weight limitations applied to motor carriers or iii legislation or regulatory changes that impose operating restrictions on railroads or that adversely affect the profitability of some or all railroad traffic finally many movements face product or geographic competition where our customers can use different products eg natural gas instead of coal sorghum instead of corn or commodities from different locations eg grain from states or countries that we do not serve  crude oil from different regions sourcing different commodities or different locations allows shippers to substitute different carriers and such competition may reduce our volume or constrain prices   for more information regarding risks we face from competition see the risk factors in item 1a of this report 

﻿ 

key suppliers – we depend on two key domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives both suppliers provide parts for locomotives and one also provides maintenance under a service agreement due to the capital intensive nature of the locomotive manufacturing business and sophistication of this equipment potential new suppliers face high barriers of entry into this industry therefore if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives supplying parts or providing maintenance for any reason including insolvency or bankruptcy we could experience a significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations additionally for a high percentage of our rail purchases we utilize two steel producers one domestic and one international that meet our specifications rail is critical for maintenance replacement improvement and expansion of our network and facilities rail manufacturing also has high barriers of entry and if one of those suppliers 

 

discontinues operations for any reason including insolvency or bankruptcy we could experience cost increases and difficulty obtaining rail 

﻿ 

employees   –   approximately 85 of our 41992 fulltimeequivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions on january 1 2015 current labor agreements became subject to modification and we began the current round of negotiations with the unions existing agreements remain in effect until new agreements are ratified or the railway labor act’s rla procedures which include mediation potential arbitration coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential emergency boards and congressiona l intervention are exhausted through industry and local negotiations uprr reached tentative new agreements with 12 of our 14 major rail unions nine unions representing nearly 70 of our agreement work force have ratified those agre ements by significant margins the tentative agreement failed ratification with two unions in early february 2018 representing about 10 of our agreement work force returning any further discussions with them to the jurisdiction o f the national mediation board another small union less than 1 is still out for ratification uprr and the industry currently continue in active mediation with the remaining coalition of two unions representing about 20 of our agreement work force under the railway labor act the national mediation board controls timing and location of mediation conferences and when to terminate mediation moving the parties to the next stages of the rla process contract negotiations historically continue for an extended period of time and we rarely experience work stoppages while negotiations are pending 

﻿ 

railroad security – our security efforts consist of a wide variety of measures including employee training engagement with our customers training of emergency responders and partnerships with numerous federal state and local government agencies while federal law requires us to protect the confidentiality of our security plans designed to safeguard against terrorism and other security incidents the following provides a general overview of our security initiatives 

﻿ 

uprr security measures – we maintain a comprehensive security plan designed to both deter and respond to any potential or actual threats as they arise the plan includes four levels of alert status each with its own set of countermeasures we employ our own police force consisting of more than 250 commissioned and highlytrained officers our employees also undergo recurrent security and preparedness training as well as federallymandated hazardous materials and security training we regularly review the sufficiency of our employee training programs we maintain the capability to move critical operations to backup facilities in different locations

we operate an emergency response management center 24 hours a day the center receives reports of emergencies dangerous or potentially dangerous conditions and other safety and security issues from our employees the public law enforcement and other government officials in cooperation with government officials we monitor both threats and public events and as necessary we may alter rail traffic flow at times of concern to minimize risk to communities and our operations we comply with the hazardous materials routing rules and other requirements imposed by federal law we also design our operating plan to expedite the movement of hazardous material shipments to minimize the time rail cars remain idle at yards and terminals located in or near major population centers additionally in compliance with transportation security agency regulations we deployed information systems and instructed employees in tracking and documenting the handoff of rail security sensitive materials with customers and interchange partners 

﻿ 

we also have established a number of our own innovative safety and securityoriented initiatives ranging from various investments in technology to the officer on train program which provides local law enforcement officers with the opportunity to ride with train crews to enhance their understanding of railroad operations and risks our staff of information security professionals continually assesses cyber security risks and implements mitigation programs that evolve with the changing technology threat environment to date we have not experienced any material disruption of our operations due to a cyber threat or attack directed at us 

﻿ 

cooperation with federal state and local government agencies – we work closely on physical and cyber security initiatives with government agencies including the us department of transportation dot and the department of homeland security dhs as well as local police departments fire departments and other first responders in conjunction with the association of american railroads aar we sponsor ask rail a mobile application which provides first responders with secure links to electronic information including commodity and emergency response information required by emergency personnel to respond to accidents and other situations we also participate in the national joint terrorism task force a multiagency effort established by the us department of justice and the federal bureau of investigation to combat and prevent terrorism 

 

﻿ 

we work with the coast guard us customs and border protection cbp and the military transport management command which monitor shipments entering the uprr rail network at us border crossings and ports we were the first railroad in the us to be named a partner in cbp’s customstrade partnership against terrorism a partnership designed to develop enhance and maintain effective security processes throughout the global supply chain 

﻿ 

cooperation with customers and trade associations – through transcaer transportation community awareness and emergency response we work with the aar the american chemistry council the american petroleum institute and other chemical trade groups to provide communities with preparedness tools including the training of emergency responders in cooperation with the federal railroad administration fra and other interested groups we are also working to develop additional improvements to tank car design that will further limit the risk of releases of hazardous materials

governmental and environmental regulation 

﻿ 

governmental regulation – our operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local regulations generally applicable to all businesses see also the discussion of certain regulatory proceedings in legal proceedings item 3 

﻿ 

the operations of the railroad are also subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board stb the stb has jurisdiction over rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic common carrier service of regulated traffic freight car compensation transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines and acquisition of control of rail common carriers the stb continues its efforts to explore expanding rail regulation and is reviewing proposed rulemaking in various areas including reciprocal switching commodity exemptions and expanding and easing procedures for smaller rate complaints the stb also continues to develop a methodology for determining railroad revenue adequacy and the possible use of a revenue adequacy constraint in regulating railroad rates the stb post s quarterly reports on rate reasonableness cases and maintain s a database on service complaints and has the authority to initiate investigations among other things 

﻿ 

the operations of the railroad also are subject to the regulations of the fra and other federal and state agencies in 2010 the fra issued initial rules governing installation of positive train control ptc that now has a deadline of december 31 2018 the ptc implementation deadline may be extended to december 31 2020 provided certain other criteria are satisfied ptc is a collision avoidance technology intended to override engineer controlled locomotives and stop traintotrain and overspeed accidents misaligned switch derailments and unauthorized entry to work zones final implementation of ptc will require us to adapt and integrate our system with other railroads whose implementation plan may be different than ours through 2017 we have invested approximately 26 billion in the ongoing development of ptc 

﻿ 

dot the occupational safety and health administration the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration and dhs along with other federal agencies have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety movement of hazardous materials and hazardous waste emissions requirements and equipment standards additionally various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law  

﻿ 

environmental regulation – we are subject to extensive federal and state environmental statutes and regulations pertaining to public health and the environment the statutes and regulations are administered and monitored by the environmental protection agency epa and by various state environmental agencies the primary laws affecting our operations are the resource conservation and recovery act regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act regulating the cleanup of contaminated properties the clean air act regulating air emissions and the clean water act regulating waste water discharges

the information set forth in this item 1a should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this report including management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item 7 and financial statements and supplementary data item 8 

﻿ 

we must manage fluctuating demand for our services and network capacity – if there are significant reductions in demand for rail services with respect to one or more commodities or changes in consumer preferences that affect the businesses of our customers we may experience increased costs associated with resizing our operations including higher unit operating costs and costs for the storage of locomotives rail cars and other equipment workforce adjustments and other related activities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity if there is significant demand for our services that exceeds the designed capacity of our network we may experience network difficulties including congestion and reduced velocity that could compromise the level of service we provide to our customers this level of demand may also compound the impact of weather and weatherrelated events on our operations and velocity although we continue to improve our transportation plan add capacity improve operations at our yards and other facilities and improve our ability to address surges in demand for any reason with adequate resources we cannot be sure that these measures will fully or adequately address any service shortcomings resulting from demand exceeding our planned capacity we may experience other operational or service difficulties related to network capacity dramatic and unplanned fluctuations in our customers’ demand for rail service with respect to one or more commodities or operating regions or other events that could negatively impact our operational efficiency any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

we transport hazardous materials – we transport certain hazardous materials and other materials including crude oil ethanol and toxic inhalation hazard tih materials such as chlorine that pose certain risks in the event of a release or combustion additionally us laws impose common carrier obligations on railroads that require us to transport certain hazardous materials regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss a rail accident or other incident or accident on our network at our facilities or at the facilities of our customers involving the release or combustion of hazardous materials could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury property damage and environmental penalties and remediation in excess of our insurance coverage for these risks which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

we are subject to significant governmental regulation – we are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal state and local authorities covering a variety of health safety labor environmental economic as discussed below and other matters many laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses permits and other authorizations and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us governments or regulators may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate without providing us any recourse to address any adverse effects on our business including without limitation regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution increasing the amount of our traffic subject to common carrier regulation business relationships with other railroads calculation of our cost of capital or other inputs relevant to computing our revenue adequacy the prices we charge and costs and expenses significant legislative activity in congress or regulatory activity by the stb could expand regulation of railroad operations and prices for rail services which could reduce capital spending on our rail network facilities and equipment and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity as part of the rail safety improvement act of 2008 rail carriers were to implement ptc by the end of 2015 the rail safety improvement act the surface transportation extension act of 2015 amended the rail safety improvement act to require implementation of ptc by the end of 2018 which deadline may be extended to december 31 2020 provided certain other criteria are satisfied final implementation of ptc will require us to adapt and integrate our system with other railroads whose implementation plan may be different than ours this implementation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  additionally one or more consolidations of class i railroads could also lead to increased regulation of the rail industry 

﻿ 

we may be affected by general economic conditions – prolonged severe adverse domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of financial and credit markets may affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry and may have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity and our results of operations and financial condition 

﻿ 

 

we face competition from other railroads and other transportation providers – we face competition from other railroads motor carriers ships barges and pipelines in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system while trucks barges and maritime operators are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation or legislation that eliminates or significantly increases the size or weight limitations currently applicable to motor carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect the competitive environment in which we operate 

﻿ 

we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations – we rely on information technology in all aspects of our business if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if we are unable to develop or implement new technology such as ptc or the latest version of our transportation control systems we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally if a cyber attack or other event causes significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment we could suffer a significant service interruption safety failure security breach or other operational difficulties which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures – as a railroad with operations in densely populated urban areas and other cities and a vast rail network we are exposed to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage environmental liability and other matters any material changes to litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving any or all of property damage personal injury and environmental liability that exceed our insurance coverage for such risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

we are subject to significant environmental laws and regulations – due to the nature of the railroad business our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waters handling storage transportation disposal of waste and other materials and hazardous material or petroleum releases we generate and transport hazardous and nonhazardous waste in our operations and we did so in our former operations environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties leased properties and properties owned by third parties as well as to properties we currently own environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation we have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated or are strictly liable under these laws or regulations we currently have certain obligations at existing sites for investigation remediation and monitoring and we likely will have obligations at other sites in the future liabilities for these obligations affect our estimate based on our experience and as necessary the advice and assistance of our consultants however actual costs may vary from our estimates due to any or all of several factors including changes to environmental laws or interpretations of such laws technological changes affecting investigations and remediation the participation and financial viability of other parties responsible for any such liability and the corrective action or change to corrective actions required to remediate any existing or future sites we could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

we may be affected by climate change and market or regulatory responses to climate change – climate change including the impact of global warming could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gasses including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating costs restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that a use commodities that we carry to produce energy b use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry or c manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels including chemical producers farmers and food producers and automakers and other manufacturers significant cost increases government regulation or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of 

 

energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns including for example increasing royalties charged to producers of prb coal by the us department of interior and the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers finally we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change any of these factors individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures – as a railroad with a vast network we are exposed to severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods mudslides or landslides extreme temperatures and significant precipitation line outages and other interruptions caused by these conditions can adversely affect our entire rail network and can adversely affect revenue costs and liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations – the us class i railroads are party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions the majority of our employees belong to labor unions and are subject to these agreements disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in among other things strikes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts which could cause a significant disruption of our operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could compromise our service reliability or significantly increase our costs for health care wages and other benefits which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity labor disputes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts at loadingunloading facilities ports or other transport access points could compromise our service reliability and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity labor disputes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts by employees of our customers or our suppliers could compromise our service reliability and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

the availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations – changes in demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to meet demand for rail service unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

we may be affected by fluctuating fuel prices – fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses diesel fuel prices can be subject to dramatic fluctuations and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results although we currently are able to recover a significant amount of our fuel expenses from our customers through revenue from fuel surcharges we cannot be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elevated fuel costs through our fuel surcharges additionally future market conditions or legislative or regulatory activities could adversely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharges or adequately recover increased fuel costs through fuel surcharges as fuel prices fluctuate our fuel surcharge programs trail such fluctuations in fuel price by approximately two months and may be a significant source of quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear volatility particularly in periods of rapidly changing prices international political and economic factors events and conditions affect the volatility of fuel prices and supplies weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity a severe shortage of or disruption to domestic fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity alternatively lower fuel prices could have a positive impact on the economy by increasing consumer discretionary spending that potentially could increase demand for various consumer products we transport however lower fuel prices could have a negative impact on other commodities we transport such as coal and domestic drillingrelated shipments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

we utilize capital markets – due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements we utilize longterm debt instruments bank financing and commercial paper from timetotime and we pledge certain of our receivables significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets including the credit markets or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit 

 

our access to and significantly increase the cost of commercial paper and other financing sources including bank credit facilities and the issuance of longterm debt including corporate bonds a significant deterioration of our financial condition could result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade which could restrict or at certain credit levels below investment grade may prohibit us from utilizing our current receivables securitization facility this may also limit our access to external sources of capital and significantly increase the costs of short and longterm debt financing 

﻿ 

a significant portion of our revenue involves transportation of commodities to and from international markets – although revenues from our operations are attributable to transportation services provided in the us a significant portion of our revenues involves the transportation of commodities to and from international markets including mexico and southeast asia by various carriers and at times various modes of transportation significant and sustained interruptions of trade with mexico or countries in southeast asia including china could adversely affect customers and other entities that directly or indirectly purchase or rely on rail transportation services in the us as part of their operations and any such interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity any one or more of the following could cause a significant and sustained interruption of trade with mexico or countries in southeast asia a a deterioration of security for international trade and businesses b the adverse impact of new laws rules and regulations or the interpretation of laws rules and regulations by government entities courts or regulatory bodies including modifications to the north american free trade agreement nafta and actions of taxing authorities that affect our customers doing business in foreign countries c any significant adverse economic developments such as extended periods of high inflation material disruptions in the banking sector or in the capital markets of these foreign countries and significant changes in the valuation of the currencies of these foreign countries that could materially affect the cost or value of imports or exports d shifts in patterns of international trade that adversely affect import and export markets and e a material reduction in foreign direct investment in these countries 

﻿ 

we are subject to legislative regulatory and legal developments involving taxes – taxes are a significant part of our expenses we are subject to us federal state and foreign income payroll property sales and use fuel and other types of taxes changes in tax rates   such as those included in the recently enacted us tax cuts and jobs act enactment of new tax laws revisions of tax regulations and claims or litigation with taxing authorities could result in a material effect to our results of operations financial condition and liquidity higher tax rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

we are dependent on certain key suppliers of locomotives and rail – due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment parts and maintenance potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry therefore if one of the domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives discontinues manufacturing locomotives supplying parts or providing maintenance for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience significant cost increases and reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary for our operations additionally for a high percentage of our rail purchases we utilize two steel producers one domestic and one international that meet our specifications rail is critical to our operations for rail replacement programs maintenance and for adding additional network capacity new rail and storage yards and expansions of existing facilities this industry similarly has high barriers to entry and if one of these suppliers discontinues operations for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience both significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail for maintenance and other projects 

﻿ 

we may be affected by acts of terrorism war or risk of war – our rail lines facilities and equipment including rail cars carrying hazardous materials could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks terrorist attacks or other similar events any government response thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in addition insurance premiums for some or all of our current coverages could increase dramatically or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future

property and depreciation – our railroad operations are highly capital intensive and our large base of homogeneous networktype assets turns over on a continuous basis each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated service lives which are measured in years except for rail in highdensity traffic corridors ie all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment yard and switching tracks and electronic yards for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in which all 

 

items with similar characteristics use and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources not as singular items we currently have more than 60 depreciable asset classes and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology asset strategies or other factors 

﻿ 

we determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad assets by means of depreciation studies we perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets ie rail and other track material ties and ballast and other road property our depreciation studies take into account the following factors 

﻿ 









﻿ 

for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track it has been our experience that the lives of rail in highdensity traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage ie the amount of weight carried over the rail the service lives also vary based on rail weight rail condition eg new or secondhand and rail type eg straight or curve our depreciation studies for rail in highdensity traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross tonmiles carried over the rail ie the weight of loaded and empty freight cars locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile for all other depreciable assets we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively 

﻿ 

under group depreciation the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated by multiplying the current replacement cost of track assets by a historical index factor derived from i inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ii the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate in addition we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies any deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets 

﻿ 

for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions i is unusual ii is material in amount and iii varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations 

﻿ 

when we purchase an asset we capitalize all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use however many of our assets are selfconstructed a large portion of our capital expenditures is for replacement of existing track assets and other road properties which is typically performed by our employees and for track line expansion and other capacity projects costs that are directly attributable to capital projects including overhead costs are capitalized direct costs that are capitalized as part of selfconstructed assets include material labor and work equipment indirect costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset 

﻿ 

normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred while costs incurred that extend the useful life of an asset improve the safety of our operations or improve operating efficiency are capitalized these 

 

costs are allocated using appropriate statistical bases total expense for repairs and maintenance incurred was 25 billion for 2017 23 billion for 2016 and 25 billion for 2015 

﻿ 

assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease amortization expense is computed using the straightline method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease

14 financial instruments 

﻿ 

shortterm investments – the company’s shortterm investments consist of time deposits and government agency securities these investments are considered level 2 investments and are valued at amortized cost which approximates fair value  90 million of time deposits as of december 31 2017 all shortterm investments have a maturity of less than one year and are classified as heldtomaturity there were no transfers out of level 2 during the year ended december 31 201 7  

﻿ 

fair value of financial instruments – the fair value of our short and longterm debt was estimated using a market value price model which utilizes applicable us treasury rates along with current market quotes on comparable debt securities all of the inputs used to determine the fair market value of the corporation’s longterm debt are level 2 inputs and obtained from an independent source at december 31 2017 the fair value of total debt was 182 billion approximately 13 billion more than the carrying value at december 31 2016 the fair value of total debt was 159 billion approximately 09 billion more than the carrying value the fair value of the corporation’s debt is a measure of its current value under present market conditions it does not impact the financial statements under current accounting rules at both december 31 2017 and 2016 approximately 155 million of debt securities contained call provisions that allow us to retire the debt instruments prior to final maturity at par  with out the payment of fixed call premi ums  the fair value of our cash equivalents approximates their carrying value due to the shortterm maturities of these instruments

debt maturities – the following table presents aggregate debt maturities as of december 31 2017 excluding market value adjustments 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

equipment encumbrances – equipment with a carrying value of approximately 20 billion and 23 billion at december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively served as collateral for capital leases and other types of equipment obligations in accordance with the secured financing arrangements utilized to acquire or refinance such railroad equipment 

﻿ 

as a result of the merger of missouri pacific railroad company mprr with and into uprr on january 1 1997 and pursuant to the underlying indentures for the mprr mortgage bonds uprr must maintain the same value of assets after the merger in order to comply with the security requirements of the mortgage bonds as of the merger date the value of the mprr assets that secured the mortgage bonds was approximately 60 billion in accordance with the terms of the indentures this collateral value must be maintained during the entire term of the mortgage bonds irrespective of the outstanding balance of such bonds 

﻿ 

credit facilities – at december 31 2017 we   had 17 billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility which is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper we did not draw on the facility during 2017 commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investmentgrade borrowers the facility allows for borrowings at floating rates based on london interbank offered rates plus a spread depending upon credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt the facility matures in may 2019 under a five year term and requires upc to maintain a debttonetworth coverage ratio   

﻿ 

the definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the debttonetworth coverage ratio includes among other things certain credit arrangements capital leases guarantees and unfunded and vested pension benefits under title iv of erisa at december 31 2017 the debttonetworth coverage ratio allowed us to carry up to 497 billion of debt as defined in the facility and we had 170 billion of debt as defined in the facility outstanding at that date under our current financial plans we expect to continue to satisfy the 

 

debttonetworth coverage ratio however many factors beyond our reasonable control could affect our ability to comply with this provision in the future the facility does not include any other financial restrictions credit rating triggers other than ratingdependent pricing or any other provision that could require us to post collateral the facility also includes a 125 million crossdefault provision and a changeofcontrol provision 

﻿ 

during 2017 we did not issue or repay any commercial paper and at december 31 2017 and 2016 we had no commercial paper outstanding  our revolving credit facility supports our outstanding commercial paper balances and unless we change the terms of our commercial paper program our aggregate issuance of commercial paper will not exceed the amount of borrowings available under the facility 

﻿ 

dividend restrictions – our revolving credit facility includes a debttonet worth covenant discussed in the credit facilities section above that under certain circumstances restricts the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders the amount of retained earnings available for dividends was 164 billion and 124   billion at december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively  

﻿ 

shelf registration statement and significant new borrowings – in 2016 the board of directors reauthorized the issuance of up to 40 billion of debt securities under our shelf registration we may issue from time to time any combination of debt securities preferred stock common stock or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings 

﻿ 

during 2017  we issued the following unsecured fixedrate debt securities under our current shelf registration 

﻿ 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

we used the net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes including the repurchase of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program these debt securities include changeofcontrol provisions    at december 31 2017  we had remaining authority to issue up to 155 billion of debt securities under our shelf registration 

﻿ 

receivables securitization facility – as of   december 31 2017 and 2016 we recorded 500 million and   0  respect ively of borrowings under our r e ceivables f acility as secured debt see further discussion of our receivables securitization facility in note 11 

  

16 variable interest entities 

﻿ 

we have entered into various lease transactions in which the structure of the leases contain variable interest entities vies these vies were created solely for the purpose of doing lease transactions principally involving railroad equipment and facilities and have no other activities assets or liabilities outside of the lease transactions within these lease arrangements we have the right to purchase some or all of the assets at fixed prices depending on market conditions fixedprice purchase options available in the leases could potentially provide benefits to us however these benefits are not expected to be significant 

﻿ 

we maintain and operate the assets based on contractual obligations within the lease arrangements which set specific guidelines consistent within the railroad industry as such we have no control over activities that could materially impact the fair value of the leased assets we do not hold the power to direct the activities of the vies and therefore do not control the ongoing activities that have a significant impact on the economic performance of the vies additionally we do not have the obligation to absorb losses of the vies or the right to receive benefits of the vies that could potentially be significant to the vies 

﻿ 

we are not considered to be the primary beneficiary and do not consolidate these vies because our actions and decisions do not have the most significant effect on the vie’s performance and our fixedprice purchase options are not considered to be potentially significant to the vies the future minimum lease payments associated with the vie leases totaled 19 billion as of december 31 2017 

  

 

17 leases 

﻿ 

we lease certain locomotives freight cars and other property the consolidated statements of financial position as of december 31 2017 and 2016 included   1635 million net of 953   million of accumulated depreciation and 1997 million net of 1121   million of accumulated depreciation respectively for properties held under capital leases a charge to income resulting from the depreciation for assets held under capital leases is included within depreciation expense in our consolidated statements of income future minimum lease payments for operating and capital leases with initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of december 31 2017 were as follows 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

approximately 97 of capital lease payments relate to locomotives rent expense for operating leases with terms exceeding one month was   480 million in 2017   535 million in 201 6  and   590 million in 201 5  when cash rental payments are not made on a straightline basis we recognize variable rental expense on a straightline basis over the lease term contingent rentals and subrentals are not significant 

  

18 commitments and contingencies 

﻿ 

asserted and unasserted claims – various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries we cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity to the extent possible we have recorded a liability where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated we do not expect that any known lawsuits claims environmental costs commitments contingent liabilities or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters

personal injury – the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability including unasserted claims the federal employers’ liability act fela governs compensation for workrelated accidents under fela damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or outofcourt settlements we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 

﻿ 

our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments approximately 95 of the recorded liability is related to asserted claims and approximately 5 is related to unasserted claims at december 31 2017 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 285 million to 310 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation 

﻿ 

 

our personal injury liability activity was as follows 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

in conjunction with the liability update performed in 2017 we also reassessed our estimated insurance recoveries we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2017 and 2016 any changes to recorded insurance recoveries are included in the above table in the changes in estimates for prior years category 

﻿ 

asbestos – we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other parties allege exposure to asbestos we assess our potential liability using a statistical analysis of resolution costs for asbestosrelated claims this liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing costs the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions 

﻿ 









﻿ 

our liability for asbestosrelated claims is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments approximately 16 of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 84 related to unasserted claims at december 31 2017 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestos related claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 99 million to 105 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other 

﻿ 

our asbestosrelated liability activity was as follows 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

in conjunction with the liability update performed in 2017 we also reassessed our estimated insurance recoveries we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2017 and 2016 the amounts recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts however future events such as the number of new claims filed each year average settlement costs and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts estimates also may vary in the future if strategies activities and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change federal and state laws governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimants and there are material changes with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants 

﻿ 

environmental costs – we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations we have identified 315 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements this includes 33 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government 21 of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list 

 

certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 

﻿ 

when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in our business we perform with assistance of our consultants environmental assessments on the property we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated our environmental liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments 

﻿ 

our environmental liability activity was as follows 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

the environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties cost estimates are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and existing technology laws and regulations the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties sitespecific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal state and local laws governing environmental remediation current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

﻿ 

insurance – the company has a consolidated whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary the captive that provides insurance coverage for certain risks including fela claims and property coverage which are subject to reinsurance the captive entered into annual reinsurance treaty agreements that insure workers compensation general liability auto liability and fela risk the captive cedes a portion of its fela exposure through the treaty and assumes a proportionate share of the entire risk the captive receives direct premiums which are netted against the company’s premium costs in other expenses in the consolidated statements of income the treaty agreements provide for certain protections against the risk of treaty participants’ nonperformance and we do not believe our exposure to treaty participants’ nonperformance is material at this time in the event the company leaves the reinsurance program the company is not relieved of its primary obligation to the policyholders for activity prior to the termination of the treaty agreements we record both liabilities and reinsurance receivables using an actuarial analysis based on historical experience in our consolidated statements of financial position 

﻿ 

guarantees – at december 31 2017 and 2016 we were contingently liable for 33 million and 43 million in guarantees respectively the fair value of these obligations as of both december 31 2017 and 2016 was 0  we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business and they include guaranteed obligations related to our affiliated operations  the final guarantee expires in 2022 we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees  we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

﻿ 

indemnities – we are contingently obligated under a variety of indemnification arrangements although in some cases the extent of our potential liability is limited depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions

environmental matters 

﻿ 

we receive notices from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are or may be liable under federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the us including sites on the superfund national priorities list or state superfund lists we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings and suits because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs

on may 2 2015 a uprr train en route from chicago il to st louis mo experienced an accidental   release of diesel fuel in the vicinity of sidney il it is believed that the release was caused by a puncture   to a fuel tank under one or more of the locomotives attached to the train the impacted fuel tanks released the majority of their contents onto the ground approximately 400 feet from an unnamed creek some of the fuel migrated into that creek which discharges to the salt fork river we immediately notified federal state and local authorities and dispatched our own emergency response resources to the scene on may 29 2015 we entered into an agreedupon interim order to perform a comprehensive site investigation and remedial measures at the release site on march 13 2017 the state of illinois issued a demand for 125000 in civil penalties as part of the ongoing enforcement action we are currently evaluating the states demand

antitrust litigation – as we reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2007 20 rail shippers many of whom are represented by the same law firms filed virtually identical antitrust lawsuits in various federal district courts against us and four other class i railroads in the us currently uprr and three other class i railroads are the named defendants in the lawsuit the original plaintiff filed the first of these claims in the us district court in new jersey on may 14 2007 the number of complaints reached a total of 30 these suits allege that the named railroads engaged in pricefixing by establishing common fuel surcharges for certain rail traffic 

  

on june 21 2012 judge friedman issued a decision that certified a class of plaintiffs with eight named plaintiff representatives the decision included in the class all shippers that paid a ratebased fuel surcharge to any one of the defendant railroads for rateunregulated rail transportation from july 1 2003 through december 31 2008 on july 5 2012 the defendant railroads filed a petition with the us court of appeals for the district of columbia requesting that the court review the class certification ruling on august 9 2013 the circuit court vacated the class certification decision and remanded the case to the district court to reconsider the class certification decision in light of a recent supreme court case and incomplete consideration of errors in the expert report of the plaintiffs after reviewing an intervening case supplemental expert materials and related briefing from the parties judge friedman scheduled and completed a new class certification hearing during the week of september 26 2016 on october 10 2017 the parties received a ruling from judge friedman denying class certification plaintiffs have sought appellate review of that ruling and on december 20 2017 were granted the right of an interlocutory appeal by the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 

﻿ 

as we reported in our current report on form 8k filed on june 10 2011 the railroad received a complaint filed in the us district court for the district of columbia on june 7 2011 by oxbow carbon  minerals llc and related entities  oxbow  the parties are currently conducting discovery in this matter for additional information on oxbow please refer to item 3 legal proceedings under other matters antitrust litigation in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2016 

﻿ 

we continue to deny the allegations that our fuel surcharge programs violate the antitrust laws or any other laws we believe that these lawsuits are without merit and we will vigorously defend our actions therefore we currently believe that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on any of our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

operating revenues 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

we generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our six commodity groups freight revenues vary with volume carloads and average revenue per car arc changes in price traffic mix and fuel surcharges drive arc we provide some of our customers with contractual incentives for meeting or exceeding specified cumulative volumes or shipping to and from specific locations which we record as reductions to freight revenues based on the actual or projected future shipments we recognize freight revenues as shipments move from origin to destination we allocate freight revenues between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them 

﻿ 

other revenues include revenues earned by our subsidiaries revenues from commuter rail operations that we manage accessorial revenues which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us or when we perform additional services such as switching or storage and miscellaneous contract revenue we recognize other revenues as we perform services or meet contractual obligations 

﻿ 

freight revenues increased 7 yearoveryear to 198 billion   driven by volume growth of 2 higher fuel surcharge revenue and core pricing gains growth in frac sand coal and intermodal shipments more than offset declines in grain crude oil  finished vehicles and rock shipments 

﻿ 

freight revenues decreased 9 in 201 6 compared to 201 5 due to a 7  decline in carloadings and lower fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by core pricing gains volume declines in coal intermodal frac sand crude oil finished vehicles and metals shipments more than offset volume growth in grain automotive parts and industrial chemicals shipments 

﻿ 

 

our fuel surcharge programs generated freight revenues of 966 million    560 million and 13 billion in 2017 2016 and 2015  respectively fuel surcharge revenue in 2017   increased 406 million as a result of a 22 increase in fuel price and 2   growth in carloadings  fuel surcharge revenue in 2016 decreased  740   m illion as a result of a 20 decrease in fuel price a 7  reduction in carloadings  and the lag impact on fuel surcharge it can generally take up to two months for changing fuel prices to affect fuel surcharge recoveries   

﻿ 

in 2017  other revenue increased from 2016 due to higher revenues at our subsidiaries primarily those that broker intermodal  transload  and refrigerated warehousing logistics services    

﻿ 

in 2016 other revenue decreased from 2015 due to lower revenues at our subsidiaries primarily those that broker intermodal and transload services and lower intermodal accessorial revenue and demurrage   fees   

﻿ 

the following tables summarize the yearoveryear changes in freight revenues revenue carloads and arc by commodity type

﻿ 

 



volume growth and core pricing gains partially offset by l ower fuel surcharge revenue and mix of traffic grain shipments increased 11 in 2016 compared to 2015 due to strong export demand in the second half of the year market conditions in south america and ample supply of us grains led to competitive us pricing relative to the global market 

﻿ 



growth in automotive parts from trucktorail conversions was offset by a 5 decrease in finished vehicles resulting from a partial contract loss during the year overall us vehicle production was flat compared to 2015  

﻿ 



declines and lo wer fuel surcharge revenue which were partially offset by core pricing gains crude oil shipments declined significantly resulting from continued low crude oil pric es regional pricing differences and available pipeline capacity fertilizer shipments also declined due to weak worldwide demand for potash in the first half of the year and the strong us dollar these decreases were partially offset by growth in industrial chemical and liquid petroleum gas shipments 

 



to 2015 shipments out of the powder river basin prb declined 24 in 2016 due to high inventory levels at utilities and competitive natural gas prices shipments out of colorado and utah declined 15 compared to 2015 due to the same drivers combined with lower international demand 

﻿ 



due to volume declines lower fuel surcharge revenue and mix of traffic partially offset by core pricing gains declines in shale drilling activity due to lower oil prices negatively impacted nonmetallic mineral frac sand shipments compared to 2015 rock shipments also decreased as weather events and flooding in the southern region during the second and third quarters limited construction activity thus limiting demand for transportation of materials in addition steel shipments declined as a result of reductions in shale drilling activity and strong   import levels associated with the strength of the us dollar 

﻿ 



compared to last year due to weaker global trade activity softer domestic sales high retail inventories and a customer bankruptcy 

﻿ 

 

mexico business – each of our commodity groups includes revenue from shipments to and from mexico freight revenue from mexico business was 23 billion in 2017 up 2 compared to 2016 core pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue more than offset the 1  volume decline the decrease in v olume was driven by lower shipments of automotive parts partially offset by growth in coal and refined petroleum products shipments 

﻿ 

freight revenue from mexico business was 22 billion in 2016 flat with 2015 lower fuel surcharge revenue and mix of traffic offset the 4 of volume growth and core pricing gains volume growth was driven by ag ricultural products coal and automotive p arts shipments

operating expenses 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 



prices volumerelated savings productivity gains and lower locomotive and freight car maintenance expense these cost reductions were partially offset by inflation d epreciation  and higher environmental and other costs  

﻿ 

compensation and benefits – compensation and benefits include wages payroll taxes health and welfare costs pension costs other postretirement benefits and incentive costs in 2017  expenses increased 5 compared to 201 6  driven by general wage and benefit inflation 86 million of expenses associated with the workforce reduction plan volumerelated costs and higher training expenses for trainmen which were partially offset by resource productivity gains 

﻿ 

in 2016 expenses decreased 8   compared to 2015 driven by lower volumerelated costs productivity gains and lower training expense general wage and benefit inflation partially offset these decreases 

﻿ 

purchased services and materials – expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors and other service providers including equipment maintenance and contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services materials used to maintain the railroad’s lines structures and equipment costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other railroads transportation and lodging for train crew employees trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers leased automobile maintenance expenses and tools and supplies purchased services and materials increased 5  in 2017 compared to 201 6 primarily due to volumerelated costs including higher subsidiary contract services and hurricane harveyrelated contract service costs which were partially offset by lower joint facility expenses 

 

purchased services and materials in 2016 decreased 7 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower volumerelated costs and lower locomotive and freight car repair and maintenance expenses   

﻿ 

fuel – fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and nonhighway vehicles and heavy equipment locomotive diesel fuel prices which averaged  181 per gallon including taxes a nd transportation costs in 2017  compared to  148 per gallon in 2016 increased expenses 334 million in addition fuel costs were higher as grosston miles increased   5 compared to 2016    the fuel consumption rate crate computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross tonmiles in thousands improved 2  compared to 201 6  

﻿ 

locomotive diesel fuel prices which averaged 148   per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in 2016 compared to 184 per gallon in 2015 reduced expenses 347 million in addition fuel costs were lower as grosston miles decreased   8  the fuel consumption rate crate computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross tonmiles in thousands improved 1  compared to 2015 

﻿ 

depreciation – the majority of depreciation relates to road property including rail ties ballast and other track material a higher depreciable asset base reflecting recent years’ higher capital spending increased depreciation expense in 2017 compared to 2016 this increase was partially offset by our recent depreciation studies that resulted in lower depreciation rates for some asset classes   

﻿ 

a larger depreciable asset base reflecting higher capital spending in recent years increased depreciation expense in 2016 compared to 2015 this increase was partially offset by our recent depreciation studies that resulted in lower depreciation rates for some asset classes     

﻿ 

equipment and other rents – equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies freight car intermodal and locomotive leases and office and other rent expenses    equity income from certain equity method investments is also included equipment and other rents expense decreased 249 million compared to 2016 212 million of the reduction was due to income tax adjustments at certain equitymethod affiliates lower locomotive and freight car lease expense also contributed to the yearoveryear decrease conversely increased car rent expense due to volume growth in certain markets partially offset these decreases 

﻿ 

equipment and other rents expe nse decreased 93 million in 2016 compared to 2015 as lower volume levels drove a r educ tion in car hire and locomotive lease expense s  

﻿ 

other – other expenses include state and local taxes freight equipment and property damage utilities insurance personal injury environmental employee travel telephone and cellular computer software bad debt and other general expenses  other expenses decreased   5 in 2017   compared to 2016 as a result of lower environmental and   personal injury expenses and higher bad debt expense in 2016 resulting from a customer bankruptcy conversely increased costs associated with destroyed equipment owned by third parties and higher property and damaged freight costs partially offset these decreases 

  

other expenses increased 8 i n 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of higher environmental costs state and local taxes bad debt expense customer bankruptcy and the writeoff of certain inprogress capit al projects that were cancelled  these cost increases were partially offset by lower expenses for damaged freight property  and equipment not owned by the company    

﻿ 

nonoperating items 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

other income – other income increased in 201 7 compared to 201 6 primarily as a result of a 65 million gain on a litigation settlement for back rent and a 57 million real estate sale gain both recognized in the third quarter of 2017 rental income also increased in 2017 compared to 2016 

﻿ 

 

other income decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to   large real estate transactions a 113 million gain from a real estate sale in 2015  partially offset by 67 million of gains from two real estate sales in 2016 

﻿ 

interest expense – interest expense increased in 2017 compared to 2016   due to an increased weightedaverage debt level of  159 billion in 2017 from 150 billion in 2016 partially offset by the impact of a lower effective interest rate of 46 in 2017 compared to 47 in 2016   

﻿ 

interest expense increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to an increased weightedaverage debt level of 150 billion in 2016 from 130 billion in 2015 partially offset by the impact of a lower effective interest rate of 47 in 2016 compared to 48 in 2015

﻿ 

operatingperformance statistics 

﻿ 

railroad performance measures are included in the table below 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

average train speed – average train speed is calculated by dividing train miles by hours operated on our main lines between terminals average train speed as reported to the association of american railroads declined   5  in 2017 compared to 2016 as disruptions across our network including the impact of hurricane harvey negatively impacted network fluidity continued implementation and testing of positive train control across a growing number of routes in our network   combined with operational challenges also negatively impacted overall average train speed   

﻿ 

average train speed improved 5 in 2016 compared to 2015 velocity gains resulted from lower volumes improved network fluidity and a strong resource position 

﻿ 

average terminal dwell time – average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our terminals lower average terminal dwell time improves asset utilization and service average terminal dwell time increased   8  in 2017 compared to 201 6 resulting from network disruptions and operational challenges which negatively impacted network fluidity 

﻿ 

averag e terminal dwell time improved 4 in 2016 compared to 2015  reflecting the impact of lower volume and improved network operations 

﻿ 

gross and revenue tonmiles – gross tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled revenue tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the

﻿ 

adjusted debt to capital is a nongaap financial measure under sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the total amount of leverage in our capital structure including offbalance sheet lease obligations which we generally incur in connection with financing the acquisition of locomotives and freight cars and certain facilities operating leases were discounted using 46 and 47  at december 31 2017 and 2016  respectively  the discount rate reflects our effective interest rate we monitor the ratio of adjusted debt to capital as we manage our capital structure to balance costeffective and efficient access to the capital markets with our overall cost of capital adjusted debt to capital should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for debt to capital the tables above provide reconciliations from debt to capital to adjusted debt to capital our december 31 2017 debt to capital ratios decreased as a result of a 49 b illion increase in   equity from december 31 2016  the increase i n equity is largely due to a 59 billion reduction to our deferred tax liability that was recog nized as an income tax benefit in 2017    

  

 

liquidity and capital resources 

﻿ 

as of december 31 2017  our principal sources of liquidity included cash cash equivalents our receivables securitization facility and our revolving credit facility as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets we had 17 billion of committed credit available under our credit facility with no borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2017  we did not make any borrowings under this facility during 2017 the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the 650 million capacity receivables securitization facility was 500 million as of december 31 2017    our access to this receivables securitization facility may be reduced or restricted if our bond ratings fall to certain levels below investment grade if our bond rating were to deteriorate it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financings is dependent on market conditions deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability we expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity through any or all of the following sources or activities i increasing the size or utilization of our receivables securitization ii issuing commercial paper iii entering into bank loans outside of our revolving credit facility or iv issuing bonds or other debt securities to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets the company’s 17 billion revolving credit facility is intended to support the issuance of commercial paper by upc and also serves as an emergency source of liquidity the company currently does not intend to make any borrowings under this facility 

﻿ 

at december 31 201 7  we had a working capital surplus at december 31 2016 we had a working capital deficit  the decrease at 2016 yearend was primarily due to a decrease in other current assets related to a tax receivable for the late extension of bonus depreciation at december 31 2015 along with an increase at december 31 201 6  in accounts payable and upcoming debt maturities   we maintain adequate resources and when necessary have adequate access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements in addition to sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

operating activities 

﻿ 

cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 due t o the timing of tax payments in 2016 related to bonus depreciation on capital spending the decrease was mostly offset by higher income in 2017 compared to 2016 

  

cash provided by operating activities increased in 2016 compared to 2015 the timing of tax payments primarily related to bonus depreciation and changes in working capital more than offset lower net income 

﻿ 

the tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 the tax act extended 100 bonus depreciation effective september 27 2017 through 2022  and phases out bonus deprecation by 2027  

﻿ 

investing activities 

﻿ 

lower capital investments and s hortterm investment purchases   decreased cash used in investing activities in 2017 compared to 2016 

﻿ 

lower capital investments partially offset by shortterm investment purchases decreased cash used in investing activities in 2016 compared to 2015  

﻿ 

 

the following tables detail cash capital investments and track statistics for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015

﻿ 



﻿ 

capital plan – in 2018 we expect our capital plan to be approximately 33 billion which may be revised if business conditions or the regulatory environment affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments while asset replacements will fluctuate as part of our renewal strategy we expect to use around 70 of our capital investments to renew and improve existing capital assets we will continue to balance investment in our network infrastructure and terminal capacity as appropriate including initial construction work on a new classification yard in our southern region significant investments in technology improvements are planned including ptc we also will continue commercial investments in rail facilities and equipment including approximately 60 new locomotives intermodal containers and chassis and freight cars 

﻿ 

we expect to fund our 2018 cash capital plan by using some or all of the following cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and cash on hand our annual capital plan is a critical component of our longterm strategic plan we expect our plan will enhance the longterm value of the company for our shareholders by providing sufficient resources to i replace and improve our existing track infrastructure to provide safe and fluid operations ii increase network efficiency by adding or improving facilities and track and iii make investments that meet customer demand and take advantage of opportunities for longterm growth 

  

financing activities 

﻿ 

cash used in financing activities decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 an increase of 908 million in common shares purchased and an increase of 103 million in dividends paid was more than offset by an increase of 752 million in debt issued a decrease of 173 million in debt repaid and a decrease of 191 million in debt exchange costs 

﻿ 

cash used in financing activities increased in 2016 compared to 2015 an increase of 457 million in debt repaid and a decrease of 1345 million in debt issued more than offset a decrease of 465 million in dividends paid the decrease in dividends paid was a result of adjusting the dividend payable dates in 2015 to align with the timing of the quarterly dividend declaration and payment dates within the same quarter aligning the quarterly dividend declaration and payment resulted in two payments in the first quarter of 2015 the fourth quarter 2014 dividend of 438 million which was paid on january 2 2015 as well as the first quarter 2015 dividend of 484 million which was paid on march 30 2015 the second quarter 2015 

 

dividend of 479 million was paid on june 30 2015 the third quarter 2015 dividend of 476 million was paid on september 30 2015 and the fourth quarter 2015 dividend of 467 million was paid on december 31 2015

see note 15 of the consolidated financial statements for a description of all our outstanding financing arrangements and significant new borrowings 

﻿ 

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

﻿ 

for each of the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 103   96 and 116 respectively the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis earnings represent income from continuing operations less equity earnings net of distributions plus fixed charges and income taxes fixed charges represent interest charges amortization of debt discount and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges see exhibit 12 to this report for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

﻿ 

common shareholders’ equity 

﻿ 

dividend restrictions – our revolving credit facility includes a debttonet worth covenant discussed in the credit facilities section above that under certain circumstances restricts the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders the amount of retained earnings available for dividends was 164 billion and 124 billion at december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively  

﻿ 

share repurchase program 

﻿ 

effective january 1 2017 our b oard of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 120 million shares of our c ommon stock by december 31 2020  replacing our previous repurchase program as of december 31 2017  we repurchased a total of 232 billion of our common stock since the commencement of our repurchase programs in 2007 the table below represents shares repurchased in 2017 under this repurchase program and shares repurchased in 2016 under our previous purchase program 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

managements assessments of market conditions and other pertinent facts guide the timing and volume of all repurchases we expect to fund any share repurchases under this program through cash generated from operations the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties debt issuances and cash on hand repurchased shares are recorded in treasury stock at cost which includes any applicable commissions and fees 

﻿ 

from january 1 2018 through february 8 2018 we repurchased 26 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately 349 million 

﻿ 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

﻿ 

as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and as referenced in the tables below we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments including material sources of offbalance sheet and structured finance arrangements other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets as described in item 1a of part ii of this report there is no known trend demand commitment event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition our commercial obligations financings and commitments are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations particularly within the transportation industry 

 

the following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of december 31 2017

offbalance sheet arrangements 

﻿ 

guarantees – at december 31 2017 and 2016  we were contingently liable for  33 million and 4 3 million in guarantees the fair value of these obligations as of both december 31 2017 and 2016  was 0 we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business and they include guaranteed obligations related to our affiliated operations the final guarantee expires in 2022 we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

other matters 

﻿ 

labor agreements – approximately 85 of our 41992 fulltimeequivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions on january 1 2015 current labor agreements became subject to modification and we began the current round of negotiations with the unions existing agreements remain in effect until new agreements are ratified or the railway labor act’s rla procedures which include mediation potential arbitration coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential emergency boards and congression al intervention are exhausted   through industry and local negotiations uprr reached tentative new agreements with 1 2 of our 14 major rail unions nine unions representing nearly 70 of our agreement work force have ratified those agre ements by significant margins the tentative agreement failed ratification with two unions in early february 2018 representing about 10 of our agreement work force 

 

returning any further discussions with them to the jurisdiction of the national mediation board another small union less than 1 is still out for ratification uprr and the industry currently continue in active mediation with the remaining coalition of two unions representing about 20 of our agreement work force under the railway labor act the national mediation board controls timing and location of mediation conferences and when to terminate mediation moving the parties to the next stages of the rla process contract negotiations historically continue for an extended period of time and we rarely experience work stoppages while negotiations are pending 

﻿ 

inflation – long periods of inflation significantly increase asset replacement costs for capitalintensive companies as a result assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels depreciation charges on an inflationadjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 

﻿ 

sensitivity analyses – the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 

﻿ 

at december 31 2017  we had variablerate debt representing approximately 44 of our total debt if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2018   than our december 31 2017 variable rate which was approximately 22  our interest expense would increase by approximately 75 million this amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balance s of our variablerate debt at december 31 2017  

﻿ 

market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2017  and amounts to an increase of approximately 22 billion to the fair value of our debt at december 31 2017  we estimated the fair values of our fixedrate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 

﻿ 

accounting pronouncements – see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

﻿ 

asserted and unasserted claims – various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries we cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity to the extent possible we have recorded a liability where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated we do not expect that any known lawsuits claims environmental costs commitments contingent liabilities or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters 

﻿ 

indemnities – our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements including certain tax indemnifications can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions 

﻿ 

climate change – although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item 1a of this report we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact however we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment including investments in new technologies using training programs to reduce fuel consumption and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency 

  

cr itical accounting policies 

﻿ 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 2 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 these critical accounting 

 

policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 

﻿ 

personal injury – the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability including unasserted claims the federal employers’ liability act fela governs compensation for workrelated accidents under fela damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or outofcourt settlements we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 

﻿ 

our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments approximately 95 of the recorded liability is related to asserted claims and approximately 5 is related to unasserted claims at december 31 2017 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 285 million to 310 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation 

﻿ 

our personal injury liability activity was as follows 

﻿ 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

our personal injury claims activity was as follows 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

in conjunction with the liability update performed in 2017 we also reassessed our estimated insurance recoveries we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2017 and 2016 any changes to recorded insurance recoveries are included in the above table in the changes in estimates for prior years category 

﻿ 

asbestos – we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other parties allege exposure to asbestos we assess our potential liability using a statistical analysis of resolution costs for asbestosrelated claims this liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing costs the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions 

﻿ 









﻿ 

our liability for asbestos related claims is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments approximately 16 of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 84 related to unasserted claims at december 31 2017 because of the uncertainty 

 

surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestosrelated claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 99 million to 105 million  we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other 

﻿ 

our asbestosrelated liability activity was as follows 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

our asbestosrelated claims activity was as follows 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

in conjunction with the liability update performed in 2017 we also reassessed our estimated insurance recoveries we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2017 and 2016 the amounts recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts however future events such as the number of new claims filed each year average settlement costs and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts estimates also may vary in the future if strategies activities and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change federal and state laws governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimants and there are material changes with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants 

﻿ 

environmental costs – we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations we have identified 315 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements this includes 33 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government 21 of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 

﻿ 

when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in our business we perform with assistance of our consultants environmental assessments on the property we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated our environmental liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments 

﻿ 

our environmental liability activity was as follows 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

 

our environmental site activity was as follows 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

the environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties cost estimates are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and existing technology laws and regulations the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties sitespecific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal state and local laws governing environmental remediation current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

﻿ 

property and depreciation – our railroad operations are highly capital intensive and our large base of homogeneous networktype assets turns over on a continuous basis each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated service lives which are measured in years except for rail in highdensity traffic corridors ie all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment yard and switching tracks and electronic yards for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics use and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources not as singular items we currently have more than 60 depreciable asset classes and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology asset strategies or other factors 

﻿ 

we determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property by means of depreciation studies we perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets ie rail and other track material ties and ballast and other road property our depreciation studies take into account the following factors 

﻿ 









﻿ 

for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track it has been our experience that the lives of rail in highdensity traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage ie the amount of weight carried over the rail the service lives also vary based on rail weight rail condition eg new or secondhand and rail type eg straight or curve our depreciation studies for rail in highdensity traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross tonmiles carried over the rail ie the weight of loaded and empty freight cars locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile rail in highdensity traffic corridors accounts for approximately 70 percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material based on the number of gross tonmiles carried over our rail in high density traffic corridors during 2017 the estimated service lives of the majority of this rail ranged from approximately 19 years to approximately 41 years for all other depreciable assets we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively 

 

estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to changes in physical use technology asset strategies and other factors that will have an impact on the retirement profiles of our assets we are not aware of any specific factors that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service lives of our assets actual use and retirement of our assets may vary from our current estimates which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future periods 

﻿ 

changes in estimated useful lives of our assets due to the results of our depreciation studies could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately 65 million if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were decreased by one year annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately 70 million our recent depreciation studies have resulted in lower depreciation rates for some asset classes these lower rates will partially offset the impact of a projected higher depreciable asset base resulting in an increase in total depreciation expense by approximately 5 in 2018 versus 2017 

﻿ 

under group depreciation the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated by multiplying the current replacement cost of track assets by a historical index factor derived from i inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ii the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate in addition we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies any deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets 

﻿ 

for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions i it is unusual ii it is material in amount and iii it varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies during the last three fiscal years no gains or losses were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad properties a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations  

﻿ 

income taxes – we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns these expected future tax consequences are measured based on current tax law the effects of future tax legislation are not anticipated future tax legislati on such as a change in the corporate tax rate could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity for example a permanent 1 increase in future income tax rates would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately 430 million similarly a permanent 1 decrease in future income tax rates would decrease our deferred tax liability by approximately 430 million 

﻿ 

when appropriate we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reflect that these tax assets may not be realized in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized based on management’s judgments using available evidence for purposes of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize a deferred tax asset in 2018 and 2017 there were no valuation allowances 

﻿ 

we recognize tax benefits that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement a liability for “unrecognized tax benefits” is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards 

﻿ 

pension and other postretirement benefits – we use an actuarial analysis to measure the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and medical and life insurance benefits opeb to eligible employees in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make several assumptions the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount 

 

rates and expected rate of return on pension assets for opeb the critical assumptions are the discount rates and health care cost trend rate 

﻿ 

we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually and selected assumptions are based on the following factors 

﻿ 







﻿ 

the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit for 2018 and the estimated impact on 2018 net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit relative to a change in those assumptions

﻿ 

seasonality – some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons reflecting either or both the nature of the commodity and the demand cycle for the commodity such as certain agricultural and food products that have specific growing and harvesting seasons the peak shipping seasons for these commodities can vary considerably each year depending upon various factors including the strength of domestic and international economies and currencies and the strength of harvests and market prices for agricultural products 

﻿ 

working capital – at december 31 2016 we had a working capital deficit which does not indicate a lack of liquidity we maintain adequate resources and when necessary have adequate access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements in addition to sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities the decrease at 2016 yearend was primarily due to a decrease in other current assets related to a tax receivable for the late extension of bonus depreciation at december 31 2015 along with an increase at december 31 201 6  in accounts payable and upcoming debt maturities at december 31 2015  we had a working capital surplus 

﻿ 

competition – we are subject to competition from other railroads motor carriers ship and barge operators and pipelines our main railroad competitor is burlington northern santa fe llc its primary subsidiary bnsf railway company bnsf operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors in addition we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers motor carrier competition exists for five of our six commodity groups excluding most coal shipments because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and gulf coast waterways barges can be particularly competitive especially for grain and bulk commodities in certain areas where we operate in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times quality and reliability of service from motor carriers and other railroads motor carriers in particular can have an advantage over railroads with respect to transit times and timeliness of service however railroads are much more fuelefficient than trucks which reduces the impact of transporting goods on the environment and public infrastructure and we have been making efforts to convert certain truck traffic to rail additionally we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any of the following could also affect the competitiveness of our transportation services for some or all of our commodities i improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation ii legislation that eliminates or significantly reduces the size or weight limitations applied to motor carriers or iii legislation or regulatory changes that impose operating restrictions on railroads or that adversely affect the profitability of some or all railroad traffic finally many movements face product or geographic competition where our customers can use different products eg natural gas instead of coal sorghum instead of corn or commodities from different locations eg grain from states or countries that we do not serve  crude oil from different regions sourcing different commodities or different locations allows shippers to substitute different carriers and such competition may reduce our volume or constrain prices   for more information regarding risks we face from competition see the risk factors in item 1a of this report 

﻿ 

key suppliers – we depend on two key domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives due to the capital intensive nature of the locomotive manufacturing business and sophistication of this equipment potential new suppliers face high barriers of entry into this industry therefore if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives for any reason including insolvency or bankruptcy we could experience a significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations additionally for a high percentage of our rail purchases we utilize two steel producers one domestic and one international that meet our specifications rail is critical for maintenance replacement improvement and expansion of our network and facilities rail manufacturing 

 

also has high barriers of entry and if one of those suppliers discontinues operations for any reason including insolvency or bankruptcy we could experience cost increases and difficulty obtaining rail

we may be affected by general economic conditions – prolonged severe adverse domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of financial and credit markets may affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry and may have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity and our results of operations and financial condition 

﻿ 

we face competition from other railroads and other transportation providers – we face competition from other railroads motor carriers ships barges and pipelines in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system while trucks barges and maritime operators are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation or legislation that eliminates or significantly reduces the burden of the size or weight limitations currently applicable to motor carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect the competitive environment in which we operate 

﻿ 

we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations – we rely on information technology in all aspects of our business if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if we are unable to develop or implement new technology such as ptc or the latest version of our transportation control systems we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally if a cyber attack or other event causes significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment we could suffer a significant service interruption safety failure security breach or other operational difficulties which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures – as a railroad with operations in densely populated urban areas and other cities and a vast rail network we are exposed to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage environmental liability and other matters any material changes to litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving any or all of property damage personal injury and environmental liability that exceed our insurance coverage for such risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

we are subject to significant environmental laws and regulations – due to the nature of the railroad business our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waters handling storage transportation disposal of waste and other materials and hazardous material or petroleum releases we generate and transport hazardous and nonhazardous waste in our operations and we did so in our former operations environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties leased properties and properties owned by third parties as well as to properties we currently own environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation we have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated or are strictly liable under these laws or regulations we currently have certain obligations at existing sites for investigation remediation and monitoring and we likely will have obligations at other sites in the future liabilities for these obligations affect our estimate based on our experience and as necessary the advice and assistance of our consultants however actual costs may vary from our estimates due to any or all of several factors including changes to environmental laws or interpretations of such laws technological changes affecting investigations and remediation the participation and financial viability of other parties responsible for any such liability and the corrective action or change to corrective actions required to remediate any existing or future sites we could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

we may be affected by climate change and market or regulatory responses to climate change – climate change including the impact of global warming could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity restrictions caps taxes or other controls on 

 

emissions of greenhouse gasses including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating costs restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that a use commodities that we carry to produce energy b use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry or c manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels including chemical producers farmers and food producers and automakers and other manufacturers significant cost increases government regulation or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns including for example increasing royalties charged to producers of prb coal by the us department of interior and the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers finally we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change any of these factors individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures – as a railroad with a vast network we are exposed to severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods mudslides or landslides extreme temperatures and significant precipitation line outages and other interruptions caused by these conditions can adversely affect our entire rail network and can adversely affect revenue costs and liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations – the us class i railroads are party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions the majority of our employees belong to labor unions and are subject to these agreements disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in among other things strikes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts which could cause a significant disruption of our operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could compromise our service reliability or significantly increase our costs for health care wages and other benefits which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity labor disputes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts at loadingunloading facilities ports or other transport access points could compromise our service reliability and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity labor disputes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts by employees of our customers or our suppliers could compromise our service reliability and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

the availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations – changes in demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to meet demand for rail service unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

we may be affected by fluctuating fuel prices – fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses diesel fuel prices can be subject to dramatic fluctuations and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results although we currently are able to recover a significant amount of our fuel expenses from our customers through revenue from fuel surcharges we cannot be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elevated fuel costs through our fuel surcharges additionally future market conditions or legislative or regulatory activities could adversely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharges or adequately recover increased fuel costs through fuel surcharges as fuel prices fluctuate our fuel surcharge programs trail such fluctuations in fuel price by approximately two months and may be a significant source of quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear volatility particularly in periods of rapidly changing prices international political and economic factors events and conditions affect the volatility of fuel prices and supplies weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity a severe shortage of or disruption to domestic fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and 

 

liquidity alternatively lower fuel prices could have a positive impact on the economy by increasing consumer discretionary spending that potentially could increase demand for various consumer products we transport however lower fuel prices could have a negative impact on other commodities we transport such as coal and domestic drillingrelated shipments which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

we utilize capital markets – due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements we utilize longterm debt instruments bank financing and commercial paper from timetotime and we pledge certain of our receivables significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets including the credit markets or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to and significantly increase the cost of commercial paper and other financing sources including bank credit facilities and the issuance of longterm debt including corporate bonds a significant deterioration of our financial condition could result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade which could restrict or at certain credit levels below investment grade may prohibit us from utilizing our current receivables securitization facility this may also limit our access to external sources of capital and significantly increase the costs of short and longterm debt financing 

﻿ 

a significant portion of our revenue involves transportation of commodities to and from international markets – although revenues from our operations are attributable to transportation services provided in the us a significant portion of our revenues involves the transportation of commodities to and from international markets including mexico and southeast asia by various carriers and at times various modes of transportation significant and sustained interruptions of trade with mexico or countries in southeast asia including china could adversely affect customers and other entities that directly or indirectly purchase or rely on rail transportation services in the us as part of their operations and any such interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity any one or more of the following could cause a significant and sustained interruption of trade with mexico or countries in southeast asia a a deterioration of security for international trade and businesses b the adverse impact of new laws rules and regulations or the interpretation of laws rules and regulations by government entities courts or regulatory bodies including taxing authorities that affect our customers doing business in foreign countries c any significant adverse economic developments such as extended periods of high inflation material disruptions in the banking sector or in the capital markets of these foreign countries and significant changes in the valuation of the currencies of these foreign countries that could materially affect the cost or value of imports or exports d shifts in patterns of international trade that adversely affect import and export markets and e a material reduction in foreign direct investment in these countries 

﻿ 

we are subject to legislative regulatory and legal developments involving taxes – taxes are a significant part of our expenses we are subject to us federal state and foreign income payroll property sales and use fuel and other types of taxes changes in tax rates enactment of new tax laws revisions of tax regulations and claims or litigation with taxing authorities could result in substantially higher taxes and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

﻿ 

we are dependent on certain key suppliers of locomotives and rail – due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry therefore if one of the domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives discontinues manufacturing locomotives for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience significant cost increases and reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary for our operations additionally for a high percentage of our rail purchases we utilize two steel producers one domestic and one international that meet our specifications rail is critical to our operations for rail replacement programs maintenance and for adding additional network capacity new rail and storage yards and expansions of existing facilities this industry similarly has high barriers to entry and if one of these suppliers discontinues operations for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience both significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail for maintenance and other projects 

﻿ 

we may be affected by acts of terrorism war or risk of war – our rail lines facilities and equipment including rail cars carrying hazardous materials could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks terrorist attacks or other similar events any government response thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in addition insurance 

 

premiums for some or all of our current coverages could increase dramatically or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future

property and depreciation – our railroad operations are highly capital intensive and our large base of homogeneous networktype assets turns over on a continuous basis each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated 

 

service lives which are measured in years except for rail in highdensity traffic corridors ie all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment yard and switching tracks and electronic yards for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics use and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources not as singular items we currently have more than 60 depreciable asset classes and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology asset strategies or other factors 

﻿ 

we determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad assets by means of depreciation studies we perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets ie rail and other track material ties and ballast and other road property our depreciation studies take into account the following factors 

﻿ 









﻿ 

for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track it has been our experience that the lives of rail in highdensity traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage ie the amount of weight carried over the rail the service lives also vary based on rail weight rail condition eg new or secondhand and rail type eg straight or curve our depreciation studies for rail in highdensity traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross tonmiles carried over the rail ie the weight of loaded and empty freight cars locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile for all other depreciable assets we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively 

﻿ 

under group depreciation the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using i inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ii the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate in addition we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies any deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets 

﻿ 

for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions i is unusual ii is material in amount and iii varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations 

﻿ 

when we purchase an asset we capitalize all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use however many of our assets are selfconstructed a large portion of our capital expenditures is for replacement of existing track assets and other road properties which is typically performed by our employees and for track line expansion and other capacity projects costs that are directly attributable to capital projects including overhead costs are capitalized direct costs that are capitalized as part of selfconstructed assets include material labor and work equipment indirect costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset 

﻿ 

 

normal r epairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred while costs incurred that extend the useful life of an asset improve the safety of our operations or improve operating efficiency are capitalized these costs are allocated using appropriate statistical bases total expense for repairs and maintenance incurred was 23 billion for 201 6  2 5 billion for 201 5  and 2 4 billion for 201 4  

﻿ 

assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease amortization expense is computed using the straightline method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease

14 financial instruments 

﻿ 

shortterm investments – the company’s shortterm investments consist of time deposits and government agency securities these investments are considered level 2 investments and are valued at amortized cost which approximates fair value 60 million of time deposits as of december 31 2016 all shortterm investments have a maturity of less than one year and are classified as heldtomaturity there were no transfers out of level 2 during the year ended december 31 2016 

﻿ 

fair value of financial instruments – the fair value of our short and longterm debt was estimated using a market value price model which utilizes applicable us treasury rates along with current market quotes on comparable debt securities all of the inputs used to determine the fair market value of the corporation’s longterm debt are level 2 inputs and obtained from an independent source at december 31 2016 the fair value of total debt was 159 billion approximately 09 billion more than the carrying value at december 31 2015 the fair value of total debt was 152 billion approximately 10 billion more than the carrying value the fair value of the corporation’s debt is a measure of its current value under present market conditions it does not impact the financial statements under current accounting rules at december 31 2016 and 2015 approximately 155 million of debt securities contained call provisions that allow us to retire the debt instruments prior to final maturity with the payment of fixed call premiums or in certain cases at par the fair value of our cash equivalents approximates their carrying value due to the shortterm maturities of these instruments

﻿ 

equipment encumbrances – equipment with a carrying value of approximately 23 billion and 26 billion at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively served as collateral for capital leases and other types of equipment obligations in accordance with the secured financing arrangements utilized to acquire such railroad equipment 

﻿ 

as a result of the merger of missouri pacific railroad company mprr with and into uprr on january 1 1997 and pursuant to the underlying indentures for the mprr mortgage bonds uprr must maintain the same value of assets after the merger in order to comply with the security requirements of the mortgage bonds as of the merger date the value of the mprr assets that secured the mortgage bonds was approximately 60 billion in accordance with the terms of the indentures this collateral value must be maintained during the entire term of the mortgage bonds irrespective of the outstanding balance of such bonds 

﻿ 

credit facilities – at december 31 2016 we had 17 billion of credit available under the facility which is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper we did not draw on the facility during 2016 commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investmentgrade borrowers the facility allows for borrowings at floating rates based on london interbank offered rates plus a spread depending upon credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt the facility matures in may 2019 under a five year term and requires upc to maintain a debttonetworth coverage ratio 

﻿ 

the definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the debttonetworth coverage ratio includes among other things certain credit arrangements capital leases guarantees and unfunded and vested pension benefits under title iv of erisa at december 31 2016 the debttonetworth coverage ratio allowed us to carry up to 399 billion of debt as defined in the facility and we had 151 billion of debt as defined in the facility outstanding at that date under our current capital plans we expect to continue 

 

to satisfy the debttonetworth coverage ratio however many factors beyond our reasonable control could affect our ability to comply with this provision in the future the facility does not include any other financial restrictions credit rating triggers other than ratingdependent pricing or any other provision that could require us to post collateral the facility also includes a 125 million crossdefault provision and a changeofcontrol provision 

﻿ 

during 2016 we did not issue or repay any commercial paper and at december 31 2016 and 2015 we had no commercial paper outstanding  our revolving credit facility supports our outstanding commercial paper balances and unless we change the terms of our commercial paper program our aggregate issuance of commercial paper will not exceed the amount of borrowings available under the facility 

﻿ 

dividend restrictions – our revolving credit facility includes a debttonet worth covenant discussed in the credit facilities section above that under certain circumstances restricts the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders the amount of retained earnings available for dividends was 124 billion and 136 billion at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively 

﻿ 

shelf registration statement and significant new borrowings – on july 28 2016 the board of directors renewed its authorization for the company to issue up to 40 billion of debt securities under the company’s current three year shelf registration filed in february 2015 which had 09 billion of authority remaining under our shelf registration we may issue from time to time any combination of debt securities preferred stock common stock or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings at december 31 2016 we had remaining authority to issue up to 355 billion of debt securities under our shelf registration

we used the net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes including the repurchase of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program these debt securities include changeofcontrol provisions  

﻿ 

equipment trust – on may 9 2016  uprr consummated a passthrough pt financing whereby a pt trust was created which issued 151 million of pt trust certificates with a stated interest rate of 2495  the pt trust certificates will mature on november 9 2029  the proceeds from the issuance of the pt trust certificates were used to purchase equipment trust certificates to be issued by uprr to finance the acquisition of 59 locomotives the equipment trust certificates are secured by a lien on the locomotives the 151 million is classified as debt due after one year in our consolidated statements of financial position 

﻿ 

debt exchange – on october 4 2016  we exchanged 1006 million of various outstanding notes and debentures due between 2028 and 2044 the existing notes for 1044 million of 3799 notes the new notes due october 1 2051  plus cash consideration of approximately 183 million in addition to 11 million for accrued and unpaid interest on the existing notes in accordance with asc 4705040 debtmodifications and extinguishmentsderecognition  this transaction was accounted for as a debt exchange as the exchanged debt instruments are not considered to be substantially different the cash consideration was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of debt and the balance of the unamortized discount and issue costs from the existing notes is being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the terms of the new notes no gain or loss was recognized as a result of the exchange costs related to the debt exchange that were payable to parties other than the debt holders totaled approximately 8 million and were included in interest expense during the year ended december 31 2016

16 variable interest entities 

﻿ 

we have entered into various lease transactions in which the structure of the leases contain variable interest entities vies these vies were created solely for the purpose of doing lease transactions principally involving railroad equipment and facilities and have no other activities assets or liabilities outside of the lease transactions within these lease arrangements we have the right to purchase some or all of the assets at fixed prices depending on market conditions fixedprice purchase options available in the leases could potentially provide benefits to us however these benefits are not expected to be significant 

﻿ 

we maintain and operate the assets based on contractual obligations within the lease arrangements which set specific guidelines consistent within the railroad industry as such we have no control over activities that could materially impact the fair value of the leased assets we do not hold the power to direct the activities of the vies and therefore do not control the ongoing activities that have a significant impact on the economic performance of the vies additionally we do not have the obligation to absorb losses of the vies or the right to receive benefits of the vies that could potentially be significant to the vies 

﻿ 

we are not considered to be the primary beneficiary and do not consolidate these vies because our actions and decisions do not have the most significant effect on the vie’s performance and our fixedprice purchase options are not considered to be potentially significant to the vies the future minimum lease payments associated with the vie leases totaled 22 billion as of december 31 2016  

  

 

17 leases 

﻿ 

we lease certain locomotives freight cars and other property the consolidated statements of financial position as of december 31 2016 and 2015 included 1997 million net of  1  121 million of accumulated depreciation and 2273 million net of 1  189 million of accumulated depreciation respectively for properties held under capital leases a charge to income resulting from the depreciation for assets held under capital leases is included within depreciation expense in our consolidated statements of income future minimum lease payments for operating and capital leases with initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of december 31 2016  were as follows 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

approximately 96  of capital lease payments relate to locomotives rent expense for operating leases with terms exceeding one month was 535 million in 201 6  5 90 million in 201 5  and  593 million in 201 4  when cash rental payments are not made on a straightline basis we recognize variable rental expense on a straightline basis over the lease term contingent rentals and subrentals are not significant 

  

18 commitments and contingencies 

﻿ 

asserted and unasserted claims – various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries we cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity to the extent possible we have recorded a liability where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated we do not expect that any known lawsuits claims environmental costs commitments contingent liabilities or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters 

﻿ 

personal injury – the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability including unasserted claims the federal employers’ liability act fela governs compensation for workrelated accidents under fela damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or outofcourt settlements we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 

﻿ 

our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments approximately 94 of the recorded liability is related to asserted claims and approximately 6 is related to unasserted claims at december 31 2016 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 290 million to 317 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation 

 

our personal injury liability activity was as follows 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

in conjunction with the liability update performed in 201 6  we also reassessed our estimated insurance recoveries  we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2016 and 2015 any changes to recorded insurance recoveries are included in the above table in the changes in estimates for prior years category 

﻿ 

asbestos – we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other parties allege exposure to asbestos we assess our potential liability using a statistical analysis of resolution costs for asbestosrelated claims this liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing costs the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions 

﻿ 









﻿ 

our liability for asbestosrelated claims is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments approximately 20 of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 80 related to unasserted claims at december 31 2016 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestos related claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 111 million to 118 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other 

﻿ 

our asbestosrelated liability activity was as follows 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

in conjunction with the liability update performed in 201 6  we also reassessed our estimated insurance recoveries we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2016 and 2015  the amounts recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts however future events such as the number of new claims filed each year average settlement costs and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts estimates also may vary in the future if strategies activities and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change federal and state laws governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimants and there are material changes with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants 

﻿ 

environmental costs – we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations we have identified 292 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with 

 

alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements this includes 33 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government 21 of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 

﻿ 

when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in our business we perform with assistance of our consultants environmental assessments on the property we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated our environmental liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments 

﻿ 

our environmental liability activity was as follows 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

the environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties cost estimates are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and existing technology laws and regulations the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties sitespecific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal state and local laws governing environmental remediation current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

﻿ 

insurance – the company has a consolidated whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary the captive that provides insurance coverage for certain risks including fela claims and property coverage which are subject to reinsurance the captive entered into annual reinsurance treaty agreements that insure workers compensation general liability auto liability and fela risk the captive cedes a portion of its fela exposure through the treaty and assumes a proportionate share of the entire risk the captive receives direct premiums which are netted against the company’s premium costs in other expenses in the consolidated statements of income the treaty agreements provide for certain protections against the risk of treaty participants’ nonperformance and we do not believe our exposure to treaty participants’ nonperformance is material at this time in the event the company leaves the reinsurance program the company is not relieved of its primary obligation to the policyholders for activity prior to the termination of the treaty agreements we record both liabilities and reinsurance receivables using an actuarial analysis based on historical experience in our consolidated statements of financial position 

﻿ 

guarantees – at december 31 2016 and 2015  we were contingently liable for 43 million and 53 million in guarantees respectively the fair value of these obligations as of both december 31 2016 and 2015 was 0 we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business and they include guaranteed obligations related to our affiliated operations the final guarantee expires in 2022 we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees  we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity

﻿ 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation that occur in connection with our business we routinely assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest available information and when necessary we seek input from our thirdparty advisors when making these assessments consistent with sec rules and requirements we describe below material pending legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities other proceedings arising under federal state or local environmental laws and regulations including governmental proceedings involving potential fines penalties or other monetary sanctions in excess of 100000 and such other pending matters that we may determine to be appropriate 

﻿ 

environmental matters 

﻿ 

we receive notices from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are or may be liable under federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the us including sites on the superfund national priorities list or state superfund lists we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings and suits because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs 

﻿ 

information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies – environmental item 7 

﻿ 

other matters 

﻿ 

antitrust litigation  as we reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2007 20 rail shippers many of whom are represented by the same law firms filed virtually identical antitrust lawsuits in various federal district courts against us and four other class i railroads in the us currently uprr and three other class i railroads are the named defendants in the lawsuit the original plaintiff filed the first of these claims in the us district court in new jersey on may 14 2007 the number of complaints reached a total of 30 these suits allege that the named railroads engaged in pricefixing by establishing common fuel surcharges for certain rail traffic 

  

in addition to suits filed by direct purchasers of rail transportation services a few of the suits involved plaintiffs alleging that they are or were indirect purchasers of rail transportation and sought to represent a purported class of indirect purchasers of rail transportation services that paid fuel surcharges these complaints added allegations under state antitrust and consumer protection laws on november 6 2007 the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation ordered that all of the rail fuel surcharge cases be transferred to judge paul friedman of the us district court in the district of columbia for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings following numerous hearings and rulings judge friedman dismissed the complaints of the indirect purchasers which the indirect purchasers appealed on april 16 2010 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia affirmed judge friedman’s ruling dismissing the indirect purchasers’ claims based on various state laws 

﻿ 

on june 21 2012 judge friedman issued a decision that certified a class of plaintiffs with eight named plaintiff representatives the decision included in the class all shippers that paid a ratebased fuel surcharge to any one of the defendant railroads for rateunregulated rail transportation from july 1 2003 through december 31 2008 this was a procedural ruling which did not affirm any of the claims asserted by the plaintiffs and does not address the ability of the railroad defendants to disprove the allegations made by the plaintiffs on july 5 2012 the defendant railroads filed a petition with the us court of appeals for the district of columbia requesting that the court review the class certification ruling on august 28 2012 a panel of the circuit court of the district of columbia referred the petition to a merits panel of the court to address the issues in the petition and to address whether the district court properly granted class certification the circuit court heard oral arguments on may 3 2013 on august 9 2013 the circuit court vacated the class certification decision and remanded the case to the district court to reconsider the class certification decision in light of a recent supreme court case and incomplete consideration of errors in the expert report of the plaintiffs on october 31 2013 judge friedman approved a schedule agreed to by all parties for consideration of the class certification issue on remand 

﻿ 

on october 2 2014 the plaintiffs informed judge friedman that their economic expert had a previously 

 

undisclosed conflict of interest judge friedman ruled on november 26 2014 that the plaintiffs had until april 1 2015 to file a supplemental expert report to support their motion for class certification the plaintiffs filed their supplemental expert report on april 1 2015 judge friedman issued a scheduling order on june 19 2015 scheduling a class certification hearing for november 2 2015 judge friedman then vacated the hearing date in an order on september 28 2015 because of the potential impact resulting from the decision of the us supreme court case tyson foods v bouaphakeo    related to class action certification and damages the us supreme court issued a decision in that case on march 22 2016 after reviewing the supreme court’s decision and related briefings from the parties judge friedman issued an order scheduling the class certification hearing for the week of september 26 2016 which was conducted as scheduled the parties are awaiting the results of that hearing 

﻿ 

as we reported in our current report on form 8k filed on june 10 2011 the railroad received a complaint filed in the us district court for the district of columbia on june 7 2011 by oxbow carbon  minerals llc and related entities oxbow the complaint named the railroad and one other us class i railroad as defendants and alleged that the named railroads engaged in pricefixing and monopolistic practices in connection with fuel surcharge programs and pricing of shipments of certain commodities including coal and petroleum coke the complaint sought injunctive relief and payment of damages of over 30 million and other unspecified damages including treble damages some of the allegations in the complaint were addressed in the existing fuel surcharge litigation referenced above the complaint also included additional unrelated allegations regarding alleged limitations on competition for shipments of oxbow’s commodities judge friedman who presides over the fuel surcharge matter described above also presides over this matter on february 26 2013 judge friedman granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss oxbow’s complaint for failure to properly state a claim under the antitrust laws however the dismissal was without prejudice to refile the complaint judge friedman approved a schedule that allowed oxbow to file a revised complaint which oxbow filed on may 1 2013 the amended complaint alleges that uprr and one other class i railroad violated sections 1 and 2 of the sherman antitrust act and that uprr also breached a tolling agreement between oxbow and uprr oxbow claims that it paid more than 50 million in wrongfully imposed fuel surcharges uprr and the other railroad filed separate motions to dismiss the oxbow revised complaint on july 1 2013 judge friedman heard oral arguments on the motions to dismiss filed by uprr and the other railroad on january 8 2015 judge friedman denied the motions to dismiss on february 24 2015 this was a procedural ruling which did not affirm any of the claims asserted by oxbow and does not affect the ability of the railroad defendants to disprove the allegations made by oxbow uprr filed its answer to oxbow’s complaint on march 24 2015 and the parties continue to conduct discovery 

﻿ 

we deny the allegations that our fuel surcharge programs violate the antitrust laws or any other laws we believe that these lawsuits are without merit and we will vigorously defend our actions therefore we currently believe that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on any of our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

operating revenues 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

we generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our six commodity groups freight revenues vary with volume carloads and average revenue per car arc changes in price traffic mix and fuel surcharges drive arc we provide some of our customers with contractual incentives for meeting or exceeding specified cumulative volumes or shipping to and from specific locations which we record as reductions to freight revenues based on the actual or projected future shipments we recognize freight revenues as shipments move from origin to destination we allocate freight revenues between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them 

﻿ 

other revenues include revenues earned by our subsidiaries revenues from commuter rail operations that we manage accessorial revenues which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us or when we perform additional services such as switching or storage and miscellaneous contract revenue we recognize other revenues as we perform services or meet contractual obligations 

﻿ 

freight revenues decreased 9 in 2016 compared to 2015 due to a 7 decline in carloadings  and lower fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by core pricing gains volume declines in coal intermodal frac sand crude oil finished vehicles and metals shipments more than offset volume growth in grain automotive parts and industrial chemicals shipments 

﻿ 

freight revenues from five of our six commodity groups decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to a 6 decline in carloadings and lower fuel surcharge revenue  partially offset by core pricing gains volume declines in coal international intermodal frac sand metals crude oil and grain shipments more than offset volume growth in domestic intermodal finished vehicles automotive parts industrial chemicals and plastics shipments 

﻿ 

our fuel surcharge programs generated freight revenues of 560 million 13 billion and 2 8 billion in 2016 2015 and 2014  respectively fuel surcharge revenue in 2016 decreased  740 m illion as a result of a 20 decrease in fuel price a 7 reduction in carloadings  and the lag impact on fuel surcharge recovery it can generally take up to two months for changing fuel prices to affect fuel surcharge recoveries fuel surcharge revenue in 2015 decreased  15   b illion as a result of a 38 decrease in fuel price and a 6 reduction in carloadings 

﻿ 

in 2016 other revenue decreased from 2015 due to lower revenues at our subsidiaries primarily those that broker intermodal and a utomotive services and lower intermodal accessorial revenue and demurrage   fees   

﻿ 

in 2015 other revenue decreased from 2014 due to lower revenues at our subsidiaries primarily those that broker intermodal and automotive services partially offset by higher accessorial revenue driven by increased revenue for container usage and demurrage fees   

﻿ 

 

the following tables summarize the yearoveryear changes in freight revenues revenue carloads and arc by commodity type

﻿ 



﻿ 



﻿ 

 



shipments in 2015 compared to 2014  grain shipments decreased 11 in 2015 compared to 2014 the strength of the us dollar lower grain commodity prices and higher worldwide inventories contributed to the reduction in overall demand 

﻿ 



revenue   h igher automotive production and record   sales levels drove the volume growth 

﻿ 



declined in 2015 versus 2014 due to lower fuel surcharge revenue and volume declines which more than offset core price improvements crude oil shipments declined as a result of the drop in crude oil prices and production declines from various shale formations which impacted the regional pricing differences for crude oil lower fertilizer shipments also decreased freight revenue in 2015 strength in export plastics markets and industrial chemical shipments helped offset the decline in crude oil and fertilizer shipments 

 



the prb declined 15 in 2015 as a result of depressed coal markets due to low natural gas prices and high inventory levels shipments out of the prb also were negatively impacted as heavy rains in june 2015 flooded coal mines and washed out tracks in some areas impacting both second and third quarter shipments shipments out of colorado and utah declined 33  in 2015 primarily due to lower domestic demand for colorado and utah coal this lower demand was a result of several utilities switching to other fuel sources due to lower natural gas prices in addition coal exports declined due to a soft global market 

﻿ 



import levels associated with the strength of the us dollar 

﻿ 

freight revenue from industrial products shipments decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to volume declines lower fuel surcharge revenue and lower arc due to the mix of traffic partially offset by core price improvements declines in shale drilling activity due to lower oil prices decreased nonmetallic mineral shipments primarily frac sand carloadings steel shipments also declined as a result of reductions in shale drilling activity low commodity prices and increased imports associated with the strength of the us dollar low commodity prices for lumber and the strong us dollar resulted in reduced lumber shipments 

 



2014  international shipments declined 8 resulting from the supply chain disruptions stemming from the west coast port work disruptions and historically high retail inventories domestic volume increased 3 driven by continued conversions from trucks and new premium services more than offsetting the impact of high retail inventory levels and modest retail sales activity 

﻿ 

mexico business – each of our commodity groups includes revenue from shipments to and from mexico freight revenue from mexico business was 22 billion flat with 2015 lower fuel surcharge revenue and mix of traffic offset the 4 of volume growth and core pricing gains volume growth was driven by ag ricultural products coal and automotive p arts shipments 

﻿ 

revenue from mexico business decreased 4 to 22 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower fuel surcharge revenue volume levels were flat compared to 2014 as lower shipments of intermodal agricultural products and industrial products were offset by growth in automotive coal and chemical shipments

locomotive diesel fuel prices which averaged 184 per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in 2015 compared to 2 97 per gallon in 2014 reduced expenses 12 billion in 2015  in addition fuel costs in 2015 were lower as grosston miles decreased 9 the fuel consumption rate crate computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross tonmiles in thousands increased 1 in 2015 compared to 2014 decreases in heavier more fuelefficient shipments decreased grosston mile s   and increased the c rate   

﻿ 

depreciation – the majority of depreciation relates to road property including rail ties ballast and other track material a larger depreciable asset base reflecting higher capital spending in recent years increased   depreciation expense in 2016 compared to 2015 this increase was partially offset by our recent depreciation studies that resulted in lower depreciation rates for some asset classes   

﻿ 

a higher depreciable asset base reflecting higher capital spending in recent years increased depreciation expense in 2015 compared to 2014 this increase was partially offset by our recent depreciation studies that resulted in lower depreciation rates for some asset classes   

  

equipment and other rents – equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies freight car intermodal and locomotive leases and office and other rent expenses    equipment and other rents expense decreased  93 million compared to 2015 as lower volume levels drove a r educ tion in car hire and locomotive lease expense s

﻿ 

average train speed – average train speed is calculated by dividing train miles by hours operated on our main lines between terminals average train speed as reported to the association of american railroads improved   5  in 2016 compared to 2015 velocity gains resulted from lower volumes improved network fluidity and a strong resource position 

﻿ 

average train speed improved 6 in 2015 compared to 2014 velocity gains resulted from lower volumes improved network fluidity and a strong resource position more favorable weather conditions in the first quarter of 2015 also contributed to the improvement in our average train speed 

﻿ 

average terminal dwell time – average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our terminals lower average terminal dwell time improves asset utilization and service average terminal dwell time improved 4 in 2016 compared to 2015 reflecting the impact of lower volume and improved network operations 

﻿ 

average terminal dwell time improved 3 in 2015 compared to 2014 reflecting the impact of lower volume and improved network operations 

﻿ 

gross and revenue tonmiles – gross tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled revenue tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles gross tonmiles and revenue tonmiles decreased 8 and 9  respectively in 2016 compared to 2015 resulting from a 7 decrease in carloads changes in commodity mix drove the variances in yearoveryear declines between gross tonmiles revenue tonmiles and carloads

operating ratio – operating ratio is our operating expenses reflected as a percentage of operating revenue  our operating ratio increased 04 points to 635 in 2016 compared to 2015 c ore pric e improvements  network efficiencies and productivity gains were more than offset by the impact of lower volume inflation and other costs   

﻿ 

our operating ratio improved 04 points to a new record low of 631 in 2015 compared to 2014 c ore pricing gains the impact of lower fuel prices resource realignments network efficiencies   and productivity gains more than   offset the impact of lower volume and inflation 

﻿ 

 

employees – employee levels decreased   10 in 2016 compared to 2015 driven by lower volume levels productivity gains a smaller capital workforce and fewer transportation employees in training 

﻿ 

employee levels increased 1 in 2015 compared to 2014 driven by more employees in training and an increase in capital project work more employees were in training as a result of the number of transportation employees hired during the last half of 2014 and early 2015 to handle expected volume increases and who continued receiving training in 2015  most of which occurred in the first nine months of the year

as of december 31 2016  our principal sources of liquidity included cash cash equivalents our receivables securitization facility and our revolving credit facility as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets we had 17 billion of committed credit available under our credit facility with no borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2016  we did not make any borrowings under this facility during 201 6  the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the 650 million capacity receivables securiti zation facility was 0 as of december 31 2016  our access to this receivables securitization facility may be reduced or restricted if our bond ratings fall to certain levels below investment grade if our bond rating were to deteriorate it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financings is dependent on market conditions deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability we expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity through any or all of the following sources or activities i increasing the size or utilization of our receivables securitization ii issuing commercial paper iii entering into bank loans outside of our revolving credit facility or iv issuing bonds or other debt securities to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets the company’s 17 billion revolving credit facility is intended to support the issuance of commercial paper by upc and also serves as an emergency source of liquidity the company currently does not intend to make any borrowings under this facility 

﻿ 

at december 31 2016 we had a working capital deficit which does not indicate a lack of liquidity we maintain adequate resources and when necessary have adequate access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements in addition to sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities the decrease at 2016 yearend was primarily due to a decrease in other current assets related to a tax receivable for the late extension of bonus depreciation at december 31 2015 along with an increase at december 31 201 6  in accounts payable and upcoming debt maturities at december 31 2015  we had a working capital surplus

operating activities 

﻿ 

cash provided by opera ting activities increased in 2016 compared to 201 5 the timing of tax payments primarily related to bonus depreciation and changes in working capital more than offset lower net income 

  

cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower net income and changes in working capital partially offset by the timing of tax payments 

﻿ 

in december of 2014 congress extended 50 bonus depreciation for 2014 however the related benefit was realized in 2015 rather than 2014 similarly in december of 2015 congress extended bonus depreciation through 2019 which delayed the benefit of 2015 bonus depreciation into 2016 bonus depreciation will be at a rate of 50 for 2016 and 2017 40 for 2018 and 30 for 2019 

﻿ 

investing activities 

﻿ 

lower capital investments partially offset by shortterm investment purchases decreased cash used in investing activities in 2016 compared to 2015 

﻿ 

higher capital investments in locomotives and freight cars including 327 million in early lease buyouts   which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions   drove the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014  

﻿ 

the following tables detail cash capital investments and track statistics for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014

﻿ 

capital plan – in 2017 we expect our capital plan to be approximately  3  1 billion  which may be revised if business conditions or the regulatory environment affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on 

 

these investments  while asset replacements will fluctuate as part of our renewal strategy we expect to use 65 to 75 of our capital investments to renew and improve existing capital assets we will continue to invest in our network and terminals where appropriate balancing terminal capacity with mainline capacity significant investments in technology improvements are planned including approximately 300 million for ptc we also will continue commercial investments in rail facilit ies and equipment including approximately 60 locomotives    intermodal containers and chassis and freight cars  

﻿ 

we expect to fund our 2017 cash capital plan by using some or all of the following cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and cash on hand our annual capital plan is a critical component of our longterm strategic plan we expect our plan will enhance the longterm value of the company for our shareholders by providing sufficient resources to i replace and improve our existing track infrastructure to provide safe and fluid operations ii increase network efficiency by adding or improving facilities and track and iii make investments that meet customer demand and take advantage of opportunities for longterm growth 

  

financing activities 

﻿ 

cash used in financing activities increased in 2016 compared to 2015 an increase of 457 million in debt repaid and a decrease of 1345 million in debt issued more than offset a decrease of 465 million in dividends paid the decrease in dividends paid was a result of adjusting the dividend payable dates in 2015 to align with the timing of the quarterly dividend declaration and payment dates within the same quarter aligning the quarterly dividend declaration and payment resulted in two payments in the first quarter of 2015 the fourth quarter 2014 dividend of 438 million which was paid on january 2 2015 as well as the first quarter 2015 dividend of 484 million which was paid on march 30 2015 the second quarter 2015 dividend of 479 million was paid on june 30 2015 the third quarter 2015 dividend of 476 million was paid on september 30 2015 and the fourth quarter 2015 dividend of 467 million was paid on december 31 2015 

﻿ 

cash used in financing activities increased in 2015 compared to 2014 an increase of 712 million in dividends paid and 240 million for the repurchase of shares under our common stock repurchase program more than offset an increase of 740 million in debt issued and a decrease of 154 million in debt repaid the higher dividend payments primarily were a result of adjusting the dividend payable dates to align with the timing of the quarterly dividend declaration and payment within the same quarter as mentioned above higher dividends per share also contributed to the increase in dividends paid 

﻿ 

see note 15 of the consolidated financial statements for a description of all our outstanding financing arrangements and significant new borrowings 

﻿ 

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

﻿ 

for each of the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 96 116 and 135 respectively the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis earnings represent income from continuing operations less equity earnings net of distributions plus fixed charges and income taxes fixed charges represent interest charges amortization of debt discount and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges see exhibit 12 to this report for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

﻿ 

common shareholders’ equity 

﻿ 

dividend restrictions – our revolving credit facility includes a debttonet worth covenant discussed in the credit facilities section above that under certain circumstances restricts the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders the amount of retained earnings available for dividends was 124 billion and 136 billion at december 31 2016 and 2015  respectively 

﻿ 

 

share repurchase program 

﻿ 

effective january 1 2014 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 120 million shares of our common stock by december 31 2017 replacing our previous repurchase program as of december 31 2016  we repurchased a total of 191 billion of our common stock since the commencement of our repurchase programs in 2007 the table below represents shares repurchased under this repurchase program 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

on november 17 2016 our board of directors approved the early renewal of the share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to 120 million shares of our common stock by december 31 2020 the new authorization was effective january 1 2017 and replaces the previous authorization which expired on decem ber 31 2016 

﻿ 

managements assessments of market conditions and other pertinent facts guide the timing and volume of all repurchases we expect to fund any share repurchases under this program through cash generated from operations the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties debt issuances and cash on hand repurchased shares are recorded in treasury stock at cost which includes any applicable commissions and fees 

﻿ 

from jan uary 1 2017 through february 2 2017 we repurchased 2  75 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately  291 million 

﻿ 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

﻿ 

as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and as referenced in the tables below we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments including material sources of offbalance sheet and structured finance arrangements other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets as described in item 1a of part ii of this report there is no known trend demand commitment event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition our commercial obligations financings and commitments are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations particularly within the transportation industry 

﻿ 

 

the following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of december 31 2016  

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 













﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 









  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

﻿ 

guarantees – at december 31 2016 and 2015  we were contingently liable for 43 million and 53 million in guarantees t he fair value of these obligations as of both december 31 2016 and 2015  was 0  we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business and they include guaranteed obligations related to our affiliated operations the final guarantee expires in 2022 we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

other matters 

﻿ 

labor agreements – approximately 84 of our 42919 fulltimeequivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions on january 1 2015 current labor agreements became subject to modification and we began the current round of negotiations with the unions existing agreements remain in effect until new agreements are reached or the railway labor act’s rla procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential emergency boards and congressional intervention are exhausted the railroad industry is currently in mediation with all bargaining coalitions under the railway labor act the national mediation board controls timing and location of mediation conferences and when to terminate mediation moving the parties to the next stages of the rla process contract negotiations historically continue for an extended period of time and we rarely experience work stoppages while negotiations are pending  

 

inflation – long periods of inflation significantly increase asset replacement costs for capitalintensive companies as a result assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels depreciation charges on an inflationadjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 

﻿ 

sensitivity analyses – the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 

﻿ 

at december 31 2016 we had variablerate debt representing approximately 07 of our total debt if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2017 than our december 31 2016 variable rate which was approximately 17 our interest expense would increase by approximately 1 million this amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balances of our variablerate debt at december 31 2016 

﻿ 

market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2016 and amounts to an increase of approximately 1 9 billion to the fair value of our debt at december 31 2016 we estimated the fair values of our fixedrate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 

﻿ 

accounting pronouncements – see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

﻿ 

asserted and unasserted claims – various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries we cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity to the extent possible we have recorded a liability where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated we do not expect that any known lawsuits claims environmental costs commitments contingent liabilities or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters 

﻿ 

indemnities – our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements including certain tax indemnifications can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions 

﻿ 

climate change – although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item 1a of this report we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact however we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment including investments in new technologies using training programs to reduce fuel consumption and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency 

  

cr itical accounting policies 

﻿ 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 2 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 these critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 

﻿ 

personal injury – the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability including unasserted claims the federal 

 

employers’ liability act fela governs compensation for workrelated accidents under fela damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or outofcourt settlements we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 

﻿ 

our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments approximately 94 of the recorded liability is related to asserted claims and approximately 6 is related to unasserted claims at december 31 2016 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 290 million to 317 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation 

﻿ 

our personal injury liability activity was as follows 

﻿ 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

our personal injury claims activity was as follows 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

in conjunction with the liability update performed in 2016 we also reassessed our estimated insurance recoveries we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2016 and 2015  any changes to recorded insurance recoveries are included in the above table in the changes in estimates for prior years category 

﻿ 

asbestos – we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other parties allege exposure to asbestos we assess our potential liability using a statistical analysis of resolution costs for asbestosrelated claims this liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing costs the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions 

﻿ 









﻿ 

our liability for asbestosrelated claims is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments approximately 20 of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 80 related to unasserted claims at december 31 2016 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestos related claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 111 million to 118 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other 

 

our asbestosrelated liability activity was as follows 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

our asbestosrelated claims activity was as follows 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

in conjunction with the liability update performed in 2016 we also reassessed our estimated insurance recoveries we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2016 and 2015  the amounts recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts however future events such as the number of new claims filed each year average settlement costs and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts estimates also may vary in the future if strategies activities and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change federal and state laws governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimants and there are material changes with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants 

﻿ 

environmental costs – we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations we have identified 292 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements this includes 33 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government 21 of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 

﻿ 

when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in our business we perform with assistance of our consultants environmental assessments on the property we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated our environmental liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments 

﻿ 

our environmental liability activity was as follows 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

 

our environmental site activity was as follows 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

the environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties cost estimates are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and existing technology laws and regulations the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties sitespecific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal state and local laws governing environmental remediation current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

﻿ 

property and depreciation – our railroad operations are highly capital intensive and our large base of homogeneous networktype assets turns over on a continuous basis each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated service lives which are measured in years except for rail in highdensity traffic corridors ie all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment yard and switching tracks and electronic yards for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics use and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources not as singular items we currently have more than 60 depreciable asset classes and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology asset strategies or other factors 

﻿ 

we determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property by means of depreciation studies we perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets ie rail and other track material ties and ballast and other road property our depreciation studies take into account the following factors 

﻿ 









﻿ 

for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track it has been our experience that the lives of rail in highdensity traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage ie the amount of weight carried over the rail the service lives also vary based on rail weight rail condition eg new or secondhand and rail type eg straight or curve our depreciation studies for rail in highdensity traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross tonmiles carried over the rail ie the weight of loaded and empty freight cars locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile rail in highdensity traffic corridors accounts for approximately 70 percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material based on the number of gross tonmiles carried over our rail in high density traffic corridors during 2016 the estimated service lives of the majority of this rail ranged from approximately 20 years to approximately 42 years for all other depreciable assets we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively 

 

estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to changes in physical use technology asset strategies and other factors that will have an impact on the retirement profiles of our assets we are not aware of any specific factors that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service lives of our assets actual use and retirement of our assets may vary from our current estimates which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future periods 

﻿ 

changes in estimated useful lives of our assets due to the results of our depreciation studies could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately 65 million if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were decreased by one year annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately  70 million our recent depreciation studies have resulted in lower depreciation rates for some asset classes these lower rates will partially offset the impact of a projected higher depreciable asset base resulting in an increase in total depreci ation expense by approximately 3 to 4  in 2017 versus 2016 

﻿ 

under group depreciation the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using i inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ii the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate in addition we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies any deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets 

﻿ 

for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions i it is unusual ii it is material in amount and iii it varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies during the last three fiscal years no gains or losses were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad properties a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations 

﻿ 

income taxes – we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns these expected future tax consequences are measured based on current tax law the effects of future tax legislation are not anticipated future tax legislation such as a change in the corporate tax rate could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity for example a permanent 1 increase in future income tax rates would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately 410 million similarly a permanent 1 decrease in future income tax rates would decrease our deferred tax liability by approximately 410 million 

﻿ 

when appropriate we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reflect that these tax assets may not be realized in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized based on management’s judgments using available evidence for purposes of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize a deferred tax asset in 2017 and 2016 there were no valuation allowances 

﻿ 

we recognize tax benefits that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement a liability for “unrecognized tax benefits” is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards 

﻿ 

pension and other postretirement benefits – we use an actuarial analysis to measure the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and medical and life insurance benefits opeb to eligible employees in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make 

 

several assumptions the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rates and expected rate of return on pension assets for opeb the critical assumptions are the discount rates and health care cost trend rate 

﻿ 

we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually and selected assumptions are based on the following factors 

﻿ 







﻿ 

the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit for 2017 and the estimated impact on 2017 net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit relative to a change in those assumptions 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

the following table presents the net periodic pension and opeb cost for the years ended december 31 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

our net periodic pension cost is expected to increase to approximately 45   million in 2017 from 4 3 million in 2016 our net periodic opeb expense is expected to increase to approximately 23 million in 2017 from 13 million in 2016

agricultural products – transportation of grains commodities produced from these grains and food and beverage products generated 17 of the railroad’s 2015 freight revenue we access most major grain markets linking the midwest and western us producing areas to export terminals in the pacific northwest and gulf coast ports as well as mexico we also serve significant domestic markets including grain processors animal feeders and ethanol producers in the midwest west south and rocky mountain states unit trains which transport a single commodity between producers and export terminals or domestic markets represent approximately 40 of our agricultural shipments 

  

automotive – we are the largest automotive carrier west of the mississippi river and operate or access over 40 vehicle distribution centers the railroad’s extensive franchise serves five vehicle assembly plants and connects to west coast ports mexico gateways and the gulf of mexico to accommodate both import and export shipments in addition to transporting finished vehicles uprr provides expedited handling of automotive parts in both boxcars and intermodal containers destined for mexico the us and canada the automotive group generated 11 of union pacific’s freight revenue in 2015 

  

chemicals – transporting chemicals generated 17 of our freight revenue in 2015 the railroad’s unique franchise serves the chemical producing areas along the gulf coast where roughly 60 of the company’s chemical business originates terminates or travels our chemical franchise also accesses chemical producers in the rocky mountains and on the west coast the company’s chemical shipments include six categories industrial chemicals plastics fertilizer petroleum and liquid petroleum gases crude oil and soda ash currently these products move primarily to and from the gulf coast region fertilizer movements originate in the gulf coast region the western us and canada through interline access for delivery to major agricultural users in the midwest western us as well as abroad soda ash originates in southwestern wyoming and california destined for chemical and glass producing markets in north america and abroad 

  

coal – shipments of coal and petroleum coke accounted for 16 of our freight revenue in 2015 the railroad’s network supports the transportation of coal and petroleum coke to independent and regulated power companies and industrial facilities throughout the us through interchange gateways and ports uprr’s reach extends to eastern us utilities mexico europe and asia water terminals allow the railroad to move western us coal east via the mississippi and ohio rivers as well as the great lakes export coal moves through west coast ports to asia and through the mississippi river and houston to europe coal traffic originating in the southern powder river basin sprb area of wyoming is the largest segment of the railroad’s coal business 

  

industrial products – our extensive network facilitates the movement of numerous commodities between thousands of origin and destination points throughout north america the industrial products group consists of several categories including construction products minerals consumer goods metals lumber paper and other miscellaneous products in 2015 this group generated 19 of our total freight revenue commercial residential and governmental infrastructure investments drive shipments of steel

seasonality – some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons reflecting either or both the nature of the commodity and the demand cycle for the commodity such as certain agricultural and food products that have specific growing and harvesting seasons the peak shipping seasons for these commodities can vary considerably each year depending upon various factors including the strength of domestic and international economies and currencies and the strength of harvests and market prices for agricultural products in response to an annual request from the surface transportation board stb to all of the class i railroads operating in the us we submit a publicly available letter during the third quarter detailing our plans for handling traffic during the third and fourth quarters each year and provide other information requested by the stb 

  

working capital – at december 31 2015 and 2014 we had a modest working capital surplus which provides enhanced liquidity in addition we believe we have adequate access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

  

competition – we are subject to competition from other railroads motor carriers ship and barge operators and pipelines our main railroad competitor is burlington northern santa fe llc its primary subsidiary bnsf railway company bnsf operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors in addition we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers motor carrier competition exists for five of our six commodity groups excluding most coal shipments because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and gulf coast waterways barges can be particularly competitive especially for grain and bulk commodities in certain areas where we operate in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times quality and reliability of service from motor carriers and other railroads motor carriers in particular can have an advantage over railroads with respect to transit times and timeliness of service however railroads are much more fuelefficient than trucks which reduces the impact of transporting goods on the environment and public infrastructure and we have been making efforts to convert certain truck traffic to rail additionally we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any of the following could also affect the competitiveness of our transportation services for some or all of our commodities i improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation ii legislation that eliminates or significantly reduces the size or weight limitations applied to motor carriers or iii legislation or regulatory changes that impose operating restrictions on railroads or that adversely affect the profitability of some or all railroad traffic finally many movements face product or geographic competition where our customers can use different products eg natural gas instead of coal sorghum instead of corn or commodities from different locations eg grain from states or countries that we do not serve  crude oil from different regions sourcing different commodities or different locations allows shippers to substitute different carriers and such competition may reduce our volume or constrain prices   for more information regarding risks we face from competition see the risk factors in item 1a of this report 

  

key suppliers – we depend on two key domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives due to the capital intensive nature of the locomotive manufacturing business and sophistication of this equipment potential new suppliers face high barriers of entry into this industry therefore if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives for any reason including insolvency or bankruptcy we could experience a significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations additionally for a high percentage of our rail purchases we utilize two steel producers one domestic and one international that meet our specifications rail is critical for 

 

maintenance replacement improvement and expansion of our network and facilities rail manufacturing also has high barriers of entry and if one of those suppliers discontinues operations for any reason including insolvency or bankruptcy we could experience cost increases and difficulty obtaining rail 

  

employees – approximately 85 of our 47457 fulltimeequivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions on january 1 2015 current labor agreements became subject to modification and we began the current round of negotiations with the unions existing agreements remain in effect until new agreements are reached or the railway labor act’s procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential emergency boards and congressional intervention are exhausted contract negotiations historically continue for an extended period of time and we rarely experience work stoppages while negotiations are pending

we operate an emergency response management center 24 hours a day the center receives reports of emergencies dangerous or potentially dangerous conditions and other safety and security issues from our employees the public law enforcement and other government officials in cooperation with government officials we monitor both threats and public events and as necessary we may alter rail traffic flow at times of concern to minimize risk to communities and our operations we comply with the hazardous materials routing rules and other requirements imposed by federal law we also design our operating plan to expedite the movement of hazardous material shipments to minimize the time rail cars remain idle at yards and terminals located in or near major population centers additionally in compliance with transportation security agency regulations we deployed information systems and instructed employees in tracking and documenting the handoff of rail security sensitive materials with customers and interchange partners 

  

we also have established a number of our own innovative safety and securityoriented initiatives ranging from various investments in technology to the officer on the train program which provides local law enforcement officers with the opportunity to ride with train crews to enhance their understanding of railroad operations and risks our staff of information security professionals continually assesses cyber security risks and implements mitigation programs that evolve with the changing technology threat environment to date we have not experienced any material disruption of our operations due to a cyber threat or attack directed at us

the operations of the railroad also are subject to the regulations of the fra and other federal and state agencies on january 12 2010 the fra issued initial rules governing installation of positive train control ptc by the end of 2015 the final regulation was issued on august 8 2014 although still under further development ptc is a collision avoidance technology intended to override engineer controlled locomotives and stop traintotrain and overspeed accidents misaligned switch derailments and unauthorized entry to work zones through 2015 we have invested approximately 20 billion in the ongoing development of ptc 

  

following the issuance of the initial rules the fra acknowledged that projected costs will exceed projected benefits by a ratio of at least 22 to one and we estimate that our final costs will be higher than those assumed by the fra on october 29 2015 congress extended the december 31 2015 ptc implementation deadline until december 31 2018 the ptc implementation deadline may be extended to december 31 2020 provided certain other criteria are satisfied we are planning to submit our required ptc safety plan to the fra in the first half of 2016 

  

on may 1 2015 the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa issued final rules governing the transportation of flammable liquids the final rule included provisions for improved tank car standards braking system requirements community notification and operating restrictions for certain trains carrying flammable liquids subsequently congress enacted the fixing america’s surface transportation act which requires the government accountability office gao to conduct an independent study on the rule’s proposed braking system requirements pending the outcome of the study the braking system requirement may be eliminated or revised we will participate in and monitor the progress of the gao study 

  

dot the occupational safety and health administration phmsa and dhs along with other federal agencies have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety movement of hazardous materials and hazardous waste emissions requirements and equipment standards additionally various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law

we may be affected by general economic conditions – prolonged severe adverse domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of financial and credit markets may affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry and may have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity and our results of operations and financial condition 

  

we face competition from other railroads and other transportation providers – we face competition from other railroads motor carriers ships barges and pipelines in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system while trucks barges and maritime operators are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation or legislation that eliminates or significantly reduces the burden of the size or weight limitations currently applicable to motor carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect the competitive environment in which we operate 

  

we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations – we rely on information technology in all aspects of our business if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if we are unable to develop or implement new technology such as ptc or the latest version of our transportation control systems we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally if a cyber attack or other event causes significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment we could suffer a significant service interruption safety failure security breach or other operational difficulties which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures – as a railroad with operations in densely populated urban areas and other cities and a vast rail network we are exposed to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage environmental liability and other matters any material changes to litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving any or all of property damage personal injury and environmental liability that exceed our insurance coverage for such risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we are subject to significant environmental laws and regulations – due to the nature of the railroad business our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waters handling storage transportation disposal of waste and other materials and hazardous material or petroleum releases we generate and transport hazardous and nonhazardous waste in our operations and we did so in our former operations environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties leased properties and properties owned by third parties as well as to properties we currently own environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation we have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated or are strictly liable under these laws or regulations we currently have certain obligations at existing sites for investigation remediation and monitoring and we likely will have obligations at other sites in the future liabilities for these obligations affect our estimate based on our experience and as necessary the advice and assistance of our consultants however actual costs may vary from our estimates due to any or all of several factors including changes to environmental laws or interpretations of such laws technological changes affecting investigations and remediation the participation and financial viability of other parties responsible for any such liability and the corrective action or change to corrective actions required to remediate any existing or future sites we could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we may be affected by climate change and market or regulatory responses to climate change – climate change including the impact of global warming could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gasses including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating costs restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that a use commodities that we carry to produce energy b use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we 

 

carry or c manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels including chemical producers farmers and food producers and automakers and other manufacturers significant cost increases government regulation or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns including for example the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers finally we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change any of these factors individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures – as a railroad with a vast network we are exposed to severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods mudslides or landslides extreme temperatures and significant precipitation line outages and other interruptions caused by these conditions can adversely affect our entire rail network and can adversely affect revenue costs and liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations – the us class i railroads are party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions the majority of our employees belong to labor unions and are subject to these agreements disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in among other things strikes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts which could cause a significant disruption of our operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could compromise our service reliability or significantly increase our costs for health care wages and other benefits which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity labor disputes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts at loadingunloading facilities ports or other transport access points could compromise our service reliability and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity labor disputes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts by employees of our customers or our suppliers could compromise our service reliability and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

the availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations – changes in demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to meet demand for rail service unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we may be affected by fluctuating fuel prices – fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses diesel fuel prices can be subject to dramatic fluctuations and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results although we currently are able to recover a significant amount of our fuel expenses from our customers through revenue from fuel surcharges we cannot be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elevated fuel costs through our fuel surcharges additionally future market conditions or legislative or regulatory activities could adversely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharges or adequately recover increased fuel costs through fuel surcharges as fuel prices fluctuate our fuel surcharge programs trail such fluctuations in fuel price by approximately two months and may be a significant source of quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear volatility particularly in periods of rapidly changing prices international political and economic factors events and conditions affect the volatility of fuel prices and supplies weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity a severe shortage of or disruption to domestic fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity alternatively lower fuel prices could have a positive impact on the economy by increasing consumer discretionary spending that potentially could increase demand for various consumer products we transport however lower fuel prices could have a negative impact on other commodities we 

 

transport such as coal frac sand and crude oil shipments which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we utilize capital markets – due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements we utilize longterm debt instruments bank financing and commercial paper from timetotime and we pledge certain of our receivables significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets including the credit markets or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to and significantly increase the cost of commercial paper and other financing sources including bank credit facilities and the issuance of longterm debt including corporate bonds a significant deterioration of our financial condition could result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade which could restrict or at certain credit levels below investment grade may prohibit us from utilizing our current receivables securitization facility this may also limit our access to external sources of capital and significantly increase the costs of short and longterm debt financing 

  

a significant portion of our revenue involves transportation of commodities to and from international markets – although revenues from our operations are attributable to transportation services provided in the us a significant portion of our revenues involves the transportation of commodities to and from international markets including mexico and southeast asia by various carriers and at times various modes of transportation significant and sustained interruptions of trade with mexico or countries in southeast asia including china could adversely affect customers and other entities that directly or indirectly purchase or rely on rail transportation services in the us as part of their operations and any such interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity any one or more of the following could cause a significant and sustained interruption of trade with mexico or countries in southeast asia a a deterioration of security for international trade and businesses b the adverse impact of new laws rules and regulations or the interpretation of laws rules and regulations by government entities courts or regulatory bodies including taxing authorities that affect our customers doing business in foreign countries c any significant adverse economic developments such as extended periods of high inflation material disruptions in the banking sector or in the capital markets of these foreign countries and significant changes in the valuation of the currencies of these foreign countries that could materially affect the cost or value of imports or exports d shifts in patterns of international trade that adversely affect import and export markets and e a material reduction in foreign direct investment in these countries 

  

we are subject to legislative regulatory and legal developments involving taxes – taxes are a significant part of our expenses we are subject to us federal state and foreign income payroll property sales and use fuel and other types of taxes changes in tax rates enactment of new tax laws revisions of tax regulations and claims or litigation with taxing authorities could result in substantially higher taxes and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we are dependent on certain key suppliers of locomotives and rail – due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry therefore if one of the domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives discontinues manufacturing locomotives for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience significant cost increases and reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary for our operations additionally for a high percentage of our rail purchases we utilize two steel producers one domestic and one international that meet our specifications rail is critical to our operations for rail replacement programs maintenance and for adding additional network capacity new rail and storage yards and expansions of existing facilities this industry similarly has high barriers to entry and if one of these suppliers discontinues operations for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience both significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail for maintenance and other projects 

  

we may be affected by acts of terrorism war or risk of war – our rail lines facilities and equipment including rail cars carrying hazardous materials could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks terrorist attacks or other similar events any government response thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in addition insurance premiums for some or all of our current coverages could increase dramatically or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future

 12 properties 

  

the following tables list the major categories of property and equipment as well as the weightedaverage estimated useful life for each category in years 

  

  



  

  



  



  

property and depreciation – our railroad operations are highly capital intensive and our large base of homogeneous networktype assets turns over on a continuous basis each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated service lives which are measured in years except for rail in highdensity traffic corridors ie all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment yard and switching tracks and electronic yards for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in 

 

which all items with similar characteristics use and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources not as singular items we currently have more than 60 depreciable asset classes and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology asset strategies or other factors 

  

we determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad assets by means of depreciation studies we perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets ie rail and other track material ties and ballast and other road property our depreciation studies take into account the following factors 

  









  

for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track it has been our experience that the lives of rail in highdensity traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage ie the amount of weight carried over the rail the service lives also vary based on rail weight rail condition eg new or secondhand and rail type eg straight or curve our depreciation studies for rail in highdensity traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross tonmiles carried over the rail ie the weight of loaded and empty freight cars locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile for all other depreciable assets we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively 

  

under group depreciation the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using i inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ii the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate in addition we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies any deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets 

  

for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions i is unusual ii is material in amount and iii varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations 

  

when we purchase an asset we capitalize all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use however many of our assets are selfconstructed a large portion of our capital expenditures is for replacement of existing track assets and other road properties which is typically performed by our employees and for track line expansion and other capacity projects costs that are directly attributable to capital projects including overhead costs are capitalized direct costs that are capitalized as part of selfconstructed assets include material labor and work equipment indirect costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset 

  

general and administrative expenditures are expensed as incurred normal repairs and maintenance are also expensed as incurred while costs incurred that extend the useful life of an asset improve the safety of our operations or improve operating efficiency are capitalized these costs are allocated using 

 

appropriate statistical bases total expense for repairs and maintenance incurred was 25 billion for 2015 24 billion for 2014 and 23 billion for 2013 

  

assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease amortization expense is computed using the straightline method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease 

  

13 accounts payable and other current liabilities 

  

  



  

a beginning in 2015 the timing of the dividend declaration and payable dates was aligned to occur within the same quarter the 2015 dividends paid amount includes the fourth quarter 2014 dividend of 438 million which was paid on january 2 2015 the first quarter 2015 dividend of 484 million which was paid on march 30 2015 the second quarter 2015 dividend of 479 million which was paid on june 30 2015 the third quarter 2015 dividend of 476 million which was paid on september 30 2015 as well as the fourth quarter 2015 dividend of 467 million which was paid on december 30 2015 

  

14 financial instruments 

  

strategy and risk – we may use derivative financial instruments in limited instances for other than trading purposes to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and fuel prices we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged both at inception and throughout the hedged period we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items at inception as well as our riskmanagement objectives strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness changes in the fair market value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are charged to earnings we may use swaps collars futures andor forward contracts to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in interest rates and fuel prices however the use of these derivative financial instruments may limit future benefits from favorable interest rate and fuel price movements 

  

market and credit risk – we address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item we manage credit risk related to derivative financial instruments which is minimal by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements at december 31 2015 and 2014 we were not required to provide collateral nor had we received collateral relating to our hedging activities 

  

interest rate fair value hedges – we manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period we generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings we employ derivatives primarily swaps as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix in addition we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixedrate debt securities 

  

swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt’s fair value attributable to the changes in interest rates we account for swaps as fair value hedges using the shortcut method therefore we do not record any ineffectiveness within our 

 

consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2015 and 2014 we had no interest rate fair value hedges outstanding 

  

interest rate cash flow hedges – we report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affects earnings as of december 31 2015 and 2014 we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding 

  

earnings impact – our use of derivative financial instruments had no impact on pretax income for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 

  

fair value of financial instruments – the fair value of our short and longterm debt was estimated using a market value price model which utilizes applicable us treasury rates along with current market quotes on comparable debt securities all of the inputs used to determine the fair market value of the corporation’s longterm debt are level 2 inputs and obtained from an independent source at december 31 2015 the fair value of total debt was 152 billion approximately 10 billion more than the carrying value at december 31 2014 the fair value of total debt was 130 billion approximately 15 billion more than the carrying value the fair value of the corporation’s debt is a measure of its current value under present market conditions it does not impact the financial statements under current accounting rules at december 31 2015 and 2014 approximately 155 million and 163 million respectively of debt securities contained call provisions that allow us to retire the debt instruments prior to final maturity with the payment of fixed call premiums or in certain cases at par the fair value of our cash equivalents approximates their carrying value due to the shortterm maturities of these instruments 

  

15 debt 

  

total debt as of december 31 2015 and 2014 is summarized below 

  

  



  



  

debt maturities – the following table presents aggregate debt maturities as of december 31 2015 excluding market value adjustments 

  

  



  

equipment encumbrances – equipment with a carrying value of approximately 26 billion and 28 billion at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively served as collateral for capital leases and other 

 

types of equipment obligations in accordance with the secured financing arrangements utilized to acquire such railroad equipment 

  

as a result of the merger of missouri pacific railroad company mprr with and into uprr on january 1 1997 and pursuant to the underlying indentures for the mprr mortgage bonds uprr must maintain the same value of assets after the merger in order to comply with the security requirements of the mortgage bonds as of the merger date the value of the mprr assets that secured the mortgage bonds was approximately 60 billion in accordance with the terms of the indentures this collateral value must be maintained during the entire term of the mortgage bonds irrespective of the outstanding balance of such bonds 

  

credit facilities – at december 31 2015 we had 17 billion of credit available under the facility which is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper we did not draw on the facility during 2015 commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investmentgrade borrowers the facility allows for borrowings at floating rates based on london interbank offered rates plus a spread depending upon credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt the facility matures in may 2019 under a fiveyear term and requires upc to maintain a debttonetworth coverage ratio 

  

the definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the debttonetworth coverage ratio includes among other things certain credit arrangements capital leases guarantees and unfunded and vested pension benefits under title iv of erisa at december 31 2015 the debttonetworth coverage ratio allowed us to carry up to 414 billion of debt as defined in the facility and we had 143 billion of debt as defined in the facility outstanding at that date under our current capital plans we expect to continue to satisfy the debttonetworth coverage ratio however many factors beyond our reasonable control could affect our ability to comply with this provision in the future the facility does not include any other financial restrictions credit rating triggers other than ratingdependent pricing or any other provision that could require us to post collateral the facility also includes a 125 million crossdefault provision and a changeofcontrol provision 

  

during 2015 we did not issue or repay any commercial paper and at december 31 2015 and 2014 we had no commercial paper outstanding  our revolving credit facility supports our outstanding commercial paper balances and unless we change the terms of our commercial paper program our aggregate issuance of commercial paper will not exceed the amount of borrowings available under the facility 

  

dividend restrictions – our revolving credit facility includes a debttonet worth covenant discussed in the credit facilities section above that under certain circumstances restricts the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders the amount of retained earnings available for dividends was 136 billion and 154 billion at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively 

  

shelf registration statement and significant new borrowings – we filed a new shelf registration statement with the sec that became effective on february 9 2015 the board of directors authorized the issuance of up to 40 billion of debt securities replacing the 40 billion authorized under our shelf registration filed in february 2013 which was fully utilized after our january 2015 debt offering noted below under our current shelf registration we may issue from time to time any combination of debt securities preferred stock common stock or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings 

  

during 2015 we issued the following unsecured fixedrate debt securities under our shelf registrations 

  

  

  



  

 

we used the net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes including the repurchase of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program these debt securities include changeofcontrol provisions at december 31 2015 we had remaining authority to issue up to 22 billion of debt securities under our shelf registration 

  

equipment trust – on may 12 2015  uprr consummated a passthrough pt financing whereby a pt trust was created which issued 399 million of pt trust certificates with a stated interest rate of 2695  the pt trust certificates will mature on may 12 2027  the proceeds from the issuance of the pt trust certificates were used to purchase equipment trust certificates to be issued by uprr to finance the acquisition of 182 locomotives the equipment trust certificates are secured by a lien on the locomotives the 399 million is classified as debt due after one year in our consolidated statements of financial position 

  

debt exchange – on august 21 2013  we exchanged 1170 million of various outstanding notes and debentures due between 2016 and 2040 the existing notes for 439 million of 3646 notes the new 2024 notes due february 15 2024 and 700 million of 4821 notes the new 2044 notes due february 1 2044  plus cash consideration of approximately 280 million in addition to 8 million for accrued and unpaid interest on the existing notes in accordance with asc 4705040 debtmodifications and extinguishmentsderecognition this transaction was accounted for as a debt exchange as the exchanged debt instruments are not considered to be substantially different the cash consideration was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of debt and the balance of the unamortized discount and issue costs from the existing notes is being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the terms of the new 2024 notes and the new 2044 notes no gain or loss was recognized as a result of the exchange costs related to the debt exchange that were payable to parties other than the debt holders totaled approximately 9 million and were included in interest expense during the year ended december 31 2013 

  

the following table lists the outstanding notes and debentures that were exchanged 

  

  



  

receivables securitization facility – as of both december 31 2015 and 2014 we recorded 400 million of borrowings under our receivables securitization facility as secured debt see further discussion of our receivables securitization facility in note 11 

  

16 variable interest entities 

  

we have entered into various lease transactions in which the structure of the leases contain variable interest entities vies these vies were created solely for the purpose of doing lease transactions principally involving railroad equipment and facilities and have no other activities assets or liabilities outside of the lease transactions within these lease arrangements we have the right to purchase some or all of the assets at fixed prices depending on market conditions fixedprice purchase options available in the leases could potentially provide benefits to us however these benefits are not expected to be significant 

 

we maintain and operate the assets based on contractual obligations within the lease arrangements which set specific guidelines consistent within the railroad industry as such we have no control over activities that could materially impact the fair value of the leased assets we do not hold the power to direct the activities of the vies and therefore do not control the ongoing activities that have a significant impact on the economic performance of the vies additionally we do not have the obligation to absorb losses of the vies or the right to receive benefits of the vies that could potentially be significant to the vies 

  

we are not considered to be the primary beneficiary and do not consolidate these vies because our actions and decisions do not have the most significant effect on the vie’s performance and our fixedprice purchase options are not considered to be potentially significant to the vies the future minimum lease payments associated with the vie leases totaled 26 billion as of december 31 2015 

  

17 leases 

  

we lease certain locomotives freight cars and other property the consolidated statements of financial position as of december 31 2015 and 2014 included 2273 million net of 1189 million of accumulated depreciation and 2454 million net of 1210 million of accumulated depreciation respectively for properties held under capital leases a charge to income resulting from the depreciation for assets held under capital leases is included within depreciation expense in our consolidated statements of income future minimum lease payments for operating and capital leases with initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of december 31 2015 were as follows 

  

  



  

approximately 95 of capital lease payments relate to locomotives rent expense for operating leases with terms exceeding one month was 590 million in 2015 593 million in 2014 and 618 million in 2013 when cash rental payments are not made on a straightline basis we recognize variable rental expense on a straightline basis over the lease term contingent rentals and subrentals are not significant 

  

18 commitments and contingencies 

  

asserted and unasserted claims – various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries we cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity to the extent possible we have recorded a liability where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated we do not expect that any known lawsuits claims environmental costs commitments contingent liabilities or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters 

  

personal injury – the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability including unasserted claims the federal employers’ liability act fela governs compensation for workrelated accidents under fela damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or outofcourt settlements we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 

  

our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments approximately 94 of the recorded liability is related to asserted claims and 

 

approximately 6 is related to unasserted claims at december 31 2015 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 318 million to 345 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation 

  

our personal injury liability activity was as follows 

  

  



  

in conjunction with the liability update performed in 2015 we also reassessed our estimated insurance recoveries we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2015 and 2014 

  

asbestos – we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other parties allege exposure to asbestos we assess our potential liability using a statistical analysis of resolution costs for asbestosrelated claims this liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing costs the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions 

  









  

our liability for asbestosrelated claims is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments approximately 22 of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 78 related to unasserted claims at december 31 2015 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestosrelated claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 120 million to 129 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other 

  

our asbestosrelated liability activity was as follows 

  

  



  

in conjunction with the liability update performed in 2015 we also reassessed our estimated insurance recoveries we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2015 and 2014 the amounts recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts however future events such as the number of new claims filed each year average settlement costs and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts estimates also may vary in the future if strategies activities and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change federal and state laws governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of 

 

claimants and there are material changes with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants 

  

environmental costs – we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations we have identified 290 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements this includes 31 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government 19 of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 

  

when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in our business we perform with assistance of our consultants environmental assessments on the property we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated our environmental liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments 

  

our environmental liability activity was as follows 

  

  



  

the environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties cost estimates are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and existing technology laws and regulations the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties sitespecific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal state and local laws governing environmental remediation current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

  

insurance – the company has a consolidated whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary the captive that provides insurance coverage for certain risks including fela claims and property coverage which are subject to reinsurance the captive entered into annual reinsurance treaty agreements that insure workers compensation general liability auto liability and fela risk the captive cedes a portion of its fela exposure through the treaty and assumes a proportionate share of the entire risk the captive receives direct premiums which are netted against the company’s premium costs in other expenses in the consolidated statements of income the treaty agreements provide for certain protections against the risk of treaty participants’ nonperformance and we do not believe our exposure to treaty participants’ nonperformance is material at this time in the event the company leaves the reinsurance program the company is not relieved of its primary obligation to the policyholders for activity prior to the termination of the treaty agreements we record both liabilities and reinsurance receivables using an actuarial analysis based on historical experience in our consolidated statements of financial position 

  

guarantees – at december 31 2015 and 2014 we were contingently liable for 53 million and 82 million in guarantees respectively we have recorded liabilities of 0 and 03 million for the fair value of these obligations as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business and they include guaranteed obligations related to our affiliated operations the final guarantee expires in 2022 we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

indemnities – we are contingently obligated under a variety of indemnification arrangements although in some cases the extent of our potential liability is limited depending on the nature of the transactions and 

 

the agreements due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions 

  

gain contingency – uprr and santa fe pacific pipelines sfpp a subsidiary of kinder morgan energy partners lp currently are engaged in a proceeding to resolve the fair market rent payable to uprr commencing on january 1 2004 for pipeline easements on uprr rightsofway  union pacific railroad company vs santa fe pacific pipelines inc sfpp lp kinder morgan operating lp “d” kinder morgan gp inc et al superior court of the state of california for the county of los angeles filed july 28 2004  in february 2007 a trial began to resolve this issue and in may 2012 the trial judge rendered an opinion establishing the fair market rent and entering judgment for back rent including prejudgment interest sfpp appealed the judgment on november 5 2014 the second district circuit court of appeal in california issued an opinion holding that uprr was not entitled to collect rent from sfpp for easements on the portions of the property acquired solely through federal government land grants issued during the 1800s the appellate court also reversed the award of prejudgment interest and remanded the case to the trial court a favorable final judgment may materially affect uprrs results of operations in the period of any monetary recoveries due to the uncertainty regarding the amount and timing of any recovery or any subsequent proceedings we consider this a gain contingency and have not recognized any amounts in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2015

 it em 3 legal proceedings 

  

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation that occur in connection with our business we routinely assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest available information and when necessary we seek input from our thirdparty advisors when making these assessments consistent with sec rules and requirements we describe below material pending legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities other proceedings arising under federal state or local environmental laws and regulations including governmental proceedings involving potential fines penalties or other monetary sanctions in excess of 100000 and such other pending matters that we may determine to be appropriate 

  

 

environmental matters 

  

as previously reported in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2012 the illinois attorney generals office notified uprr on january 14 2013 that it will seek a penalty against the railroad for environmental conditions caused by its predecessor at a former locomotive fueling facility in south pekin illinois this former cnw facility discontinued fueling operations in the early 1980s subsequent environmental investigation revealed evidence of fuel releases to soil and groundwater in january 2007 the state rejected uprrs proposed compliance commitment agreement and responded with a notice of intent to pursue legal action uprr continued to perform remedial investigations under the supervision of the illinois epa in june 2012 the illinois epa approved uprrs proposed remedial action plan for the site consisting of no further action and monitoring for a period of ten years subsequently the state notified uprr that it would seek to recover a civil penalty and during early negotiations it offered to settle its claim for 240000 uprr rejected this offer the state sued uprr on october 26 2013 in the circuit court for the tenth judicial circuit tazewell county illinois through continued settlement negotiations the parties reached a n agreement to settle this matter in exchange for a payment by uprr of 100000 a final agreement was signed by the parties and approved by the circuit court and uprr completed payment of 100000 

  

as previously reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended march 31 2015 a punctured tank car resulted in an accidental release of sulfuric acid in a rail yard in herington kansas in january 2012 the acid was released on the ground and entered a creek that runs adjacent to the yard environmental remediation at the site is complete despite negotiations with the federal government the assistant us attorney district of kansas filed a criminal charge against the railroad on march 30 2015 in the us district court for kansas the action alleges a misdemeanor charge for negligent violation of the clea n water act the penalty range wa s 2500 to 200000 in addition the federal government may debar the facility if uprr were convicted a debarment w ould prevent herington yard from participating in new government contract work on january 12 2016 the federal judge in the us district court for kansas dismissed the charge against the railroad the epa is considering whether to appeal the case or pursue civil penalties we cannot predict the ultimate impact of this proceeding at this time but the proposed penalty could exceed 100000 

  

we receive notices from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are or may be liable under federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the us including sites on the superfund national priorities list or state superfund lists we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings and suits because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs 

  

information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies – environmental item 7 

  

other matters 

  

antitrust litigation  as we reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2007 20 rail shippers many of whom are represented by the same law firms filed virtually identical 

antitrust lawsuits in various federal district courts against us and four other class i railroads in the us currently uprr and three other class i railroads are the named defendants in the lawsuit the original plaintiff filed the first of these claims in the us district court in new jersey on may 14 2007 the number of complaints reached a total of 30 these suits allege that the named railroads engaged in pricefixing by establishing common fuel surcharges for certain rail traffic 

  

in addition to suits filed by direct purchasers of rail transportation services a few of the suits involved plaintiffs alleging that they are or were indirect purchasers of rail transportation and sought to represent a purported class of indirect purchasers of rail transportation services that paid fuel surcharges these complaints added allegations under state antitrust and consumer protection laws on november 6 2007 the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation ordered that all of the rail fuel surcharge cases be transferred to judge paul friedman of the us district court in the district of columbia for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings following numerous hearings and rulings judge friedman dismissed the complaints of the indirect purchasers which the indirect purchasers appealed on april 16 2010 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia affirmed judge friedman’s ruling dismissing the indirect purchasers’ claims based on various state laws 

 

on june 21 2012 judge friedman issued a decision that certified a class of plaintiffs with eight named plaintiff representatives the decision included in the class all shippers that paid a ratebased fuel surcharge to any one of the defendant railroads for rateunregulated rail transportation from july 1 2003 through december 31 2008 this was a procedural ruling which did not affirm any of the claims asserted by the plaintiffs and does not address the ability of the railroad defendants to disprove the allegations made by the plaintiffs on july 5 2012 the defendant railroads filed a petition with the us court of appeals for the district of columbia requesting that the court review the class certification ruling on august 28 2012 a panel of the circuit court of the district of columbia referred the petition to a merits panel of the court to address the issues in the petition and to address whether the district court properly granted class certification the circuit court heard oral arguments on may 3 2013 on august 9 2013 the circuit court vacated the class certification decision and remanded the case to the district court to reconsider the class certification decision in light of a recent supreme court case and incomplete consideration of errors in the expert report of the plaintiffs on october 31 2013 judge friedman approved a schedule agreed to by all parties for consideration of the class certification issue on remand 

  

on october 2 2014 the plaintiffs informed judge friedman that their economic expert had a previously undisclosed conflict of interest judge friedman ruled on november 26 2014 that the plaintiffs had until april 1 2015 to file a supplemental expert report to support their motion for class certification the plaintiffs filed their supplemental expert report on april 1 2015 judge friedman issued a scheduling order on june 19 2015 scheduling a class certification hearing for november 2 2015 judge friedman then vacated the hearing date in an order on september 28 2015 because of the potential impact resulting from the decision of the us supreme court case tyson foods v bouaphakeo    related to class action certification and damages which w as heard on november 10 2015 the order requires the parties to file a joint schedule and briefing statement within fourteen days after the us supreme court decision in the tyson foods matter  which is expected to be issued during the first half of 2016 

  

as we reported in our current report on form 8k filed on june 10 2011 the railroad received a complaint filed in the us district court for the district of columbia on june 7 2011 by oxbow carbon  minerals llc and related entities oxbow the complaint named the railroad and one other us class i railroad as defendants and alleged that the named railroads engaged in pricefixing and monopolistic practices in connection with fuel surcharge programs and pricing of shipments of certain commodities including coal and petroleum coke the complaint sought injunctive relief and payment of damages of over 30 million and other unspecified damages including treble damages some of the allegations in the complaint were addressed in the existing fuel surcharge litigation referenced above the complaint also included additional unrelated allegations regarding alleged limitations on competition for shipments of oxbow’s commodities judge friedman who presides over the fuel surcharge matter described above also presides over this matter on february 26 2013 judge friedman granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss oxbow’s complaint for failure to state properly a claim under the antitrust laws however the dismissal was without prejudice to refile the complaint judge friedman approved a schedule that allowed oxbow to file a revised complaint which oxbow filed on may 1 2013 the amended complaint alleges that uprr and one other class i railroad violated sections 1 and 2 of the sherman antitrust act and that uprr also breached a tolling agreement between oxbow and uprr oxbow claims that it paid more than 50 million in wrongfully imposed fuel surcharges uprr and the other railroad filed separate motions to dismiss the oxbow revised complaint on july 1 2013 judge friedman heard oral arguments on the motions to dismiss filed by uprr and the other railroad on january 8 2015 judge friedman denied the motions to dismiss on february 24 2015 this was a procedural ruling which did not affirm any of the claims asserted by oxbow and does not affect the ability of the railroad defendants to disprove the allegations made by oxbow uprr filed its answer to oxbow’s complaint on march 24 2015 and the parties have commenced discovery 

  

we deny the allegations that our fuel surcharge programs violate the antitrust laws or any other laws we believe that these lawsuits are without merit and we will vigorously defend our actions therefore we currently believe that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on any of our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

free cash flow is not considered a financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe free cash flow is important to management and investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financings free cash flow should be considered in addition

2016 outlook 

  



  



  



  

continuing l ow er fuel prices could have a positive impact on the economy by increasing consumer discretionary spending that potentially could increase demand for various consumer products that we transport alternatively lower fuel prices will likely have a negative impact on other commodities such as coal frac sand and crude oil shipments 

  



  



  

 

results of operations 

  

operating revenues 

  

  



  

we generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our six commodity groups freight revenues vary with volume carloads and average revenue per car arc changes in price traffic mix and fuel surcharges drive arc we provide some of our customers with contractual incentives for meeting or exceeding specified cumulative volumes or shipping to and from specific locations which we record as reductions to freight revenues based on the actual or projected future shipments we recognize freight revenues as shipments move from origin to destination we allocate freight revenues between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them 

  

other revenues include revenues earned by our subsidiaries revenues from commuter rail operations that we manage accessorial revenues which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us or when we perform additional services such as switching or storage and miscellaneous contract revenue we recognize other revenues as we perform services or meet contractual obligations 

  

freight revenues from five of our six commodity groups decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to a 6 decline in carloadings and lower fuel surcharge revenue  partially offset by core pricing gains volume declines in coal international intermodal frac sand metals crude oil and grain shipments more than offset volume growth in domestic intermodal finished vehicles automotive parts industrial chemicals and plastics shipments 

  

freight revenues from all six commodity groups increased during 2014 compared to 2013 driven by 7 volume growth and core pricing gains of 25 volume growth from grain frac sand rock and intermodal domestic and international shipments offset declines in crude oil 

  

our fuel surcharge programs generated freight revenues of  13 billion 28 billion and 26 billion in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively fuel surcharge revenue in 2015 decreased  15   b illion as a result of a 38 decrease in fuel price and a 6 reduction in carloadings fuel surcharge revenue in 2014 increased 6 based on our 7 carloadings increase 

  

in 2015 other revenue decreased from 2014 due to lower revenues at our subsidiaries primarily those that broker intermodal and automotive services partially offset by higher accessorial revenue driven by increased revenue for container usage and demurrage fees   

  

in 2014 other revenue increased from 2013 due to higher revenues at our subsidiaries primarily those that broker intermodal and automotive services accessorial revenue driven by increased volume and per diem revenue for container usage previously included in automotive freight revenue 

  

 

the following tables summarize the yearoveryear changes in freight revenues revenue carloads and arc by commodity type 

  

  



  

  



  

  



  



  

 



drought also negatively impacted the first three quarters of 2013 which created favorable comparisons for the first three quarters of 2014 lower export wheat shipments due to a larger world crop partially offset gains in grain 

  



quarters of 2014 with improved sales and production which offset declines in the first quarter due to winter weather shifts in business mix and a change in how we are compensated for container usage which is now included as a per diem charge in other revenue negatively impacted arc compared to 2013 

  



arc driven by positive business mix increased freight revenue from chemicals in 2014 compared to 2013 shipments of industrial chemicals grew as a result of continued strong demand in the drilling market fertilizer shipments increased due to strong exports of potash reduced shipments of crude oil from the bakken and permian shale formations to the gulf area partially offset these gains as market factors primarily regional pricing differences for various types of crude oil displaced some of the former gulf coast shipments to the east and west coasts 

  

 



coal this lower demand was a result of several utilities switching to other fuel sources due to lower natural gas prices in addition coal exports declined due to a soft global market 

  

freight revenue from coal shipments increased in 2014 compared to 2013 driven by higher volumes shifts in business mix negatively impacted arc compared to 2013 sprb shipments increased 3 from 2013 strong demand continued throughout the year due to inventory replenishment but network performance and contract losses limited yearoveryear volume growth shipments from colorado and utah mines increased 6 compared to 2013 driven by higher natural gas prices for most of the year and strong exports through the west coast however in the fourth quarter volumes from colorado and utah mines declined as exports to the gulf coast decreased 

  



volume growth core pricing gains and positive business mix in 2014 increased freight revenue for industrial products shipments versus 2013 shipments of nonmetallic minerals primarily frac sand up 31 grew as a result of drilling activity for energy products as well as evolving drilling practices which can increase the amount of frac sand used at certain wells additionally rock and lumber shipments increased from 2013 driven by new housing and commercial construction 

  

 



volume growth core pricing improvements and positive business mix domestic traffic increased 11 due to continued conversions from truck transportation to rail and new premium services international traffic grew 5 versus 2013 driven primarily by new business and improving economic conditions international gains in the last three quarters of the year offset the declines in the first quarter due to severe weather that negatively impacted consumer demand 

  

mexico business – each of our commodity groups includes revenue from shipments to and from mexico   freight revenue from mexico business decreased 4 to 22 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower fuel surcharge revenue volume levels were flat compared to 2014 as lower shipments of intermodal agricultural and industrial products were offset by growth in automotive coal and chemical shipments 

  

revenue from mexico business increased 8 to 23 billion in 2014 versus 2013 volume levels increased 8 from 2013 as increases in agricultural products chemicals intermodal automotive and industrial products offset lower export coal shipments 

  

 

operating expenses 

  

  



  



materials contributed to the higher costs lower fuel price partially offset these increases in addition there were approximately 35 million of weatherrelated costs in the first quarter of 2014 

  

compensation and benefits – compensation and benefits include wages payroll taxes health and welfare costs pension costs other postretirement benefits and incentive costs in 2015 l ower volumerelated costs and second half productivity gains were more than offset by general wage inflation and increased hiring and training expenses related to a larger workforce in the first half of the year 

  

volumerelated expenses including training and a slower network increased our train and engine work force which along with general wage and benefit inflation resulted in increased wages in 2014 compared to 2013 weatherrelated costs in the first quarter of 2014 also increased costs 

  

purchased services and materials – expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors and other service providers including equipment maintenance and contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services materials used to maintain the railroad’s lines structures and equipment costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other railroads transportation and lodging for train crew employees trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers leased automobile maintenance expenses and tools and supplies  purchased services and materials decreased 137 million compared to 2014 primarily due to lower volumerelated costs including a decrease in external transportation expenses incurred by our logistics subsidiaries expenses also decreased due to lower locomotive and freight car repair costs 

  

expenses for purchased services in 2014 increased 8 compared to 2013 primarily due to volumerelated expenses incurred by our logistics subsidiaries for external transportation and increased crew transportation and lodging due to volumes and a slower network in addition higher consulting fees and higher contract expenses including equipment maintenance increased costs compared to 2013 locomotive and freight car material expenses increased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to additional volumes including the impact of activating stored equipment to address operational issues caused by demand and a slower network 

  

fuel – fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and nonhighway vehicles and heavy equipment locomotive diesel fuel prices which averaged 184 per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in 2015 compared to 297 per gallon in 2014 decreased expenses 12 billion in 

 

addition fuel costs were lower as grosston miles decreased 9 the fuel consumption rate crate computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross tonmiles in thousands increased 1 compared to 2014 decreases in heavier more fuelefficient shipments decreased grosston mile s   and increased the c rate   

  

volume growth of 7 as measured by gross tonmiles drove the increase in fuel expense in 2014 compared to 2013 this was essentially offset by lower locomotive diesel fuel prices which averaged 297 per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in 2014 compared to 315 in 2013 along with a slight improvement in crate computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross tonmiles 

  

depreciation – the majority of depreciation relates to road property including rail ties ballast and other track material a higher depreciable asset base reflecting higher capital spending in recent years increased depreciation expense in 2015 compared to 2014 this increase was partially offset by our recent depreciation studies that resulted in lower depreciation rates for some asset classes   

  

depreciation was up 7 in 2014 compared to 2013 a higher depreciable asset base reflecting higher ongoing capital spending drove the increase 

  

equipment and other rents – equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies freight car intermodal and locomotive leases and office and other rent expenses  equipment and other rents expense decreased  4 million compared to 2014 primarily from a decrease in manifest and intermodal shipments parti ally offset by growth in finished vehicle shipments 

  

higher intermodal volumes and longer cycle times increased shortterm freight car rental expense in 2014 compared to 2013 lower equipment leases essentially offset the higher freight car rental expense as we exercised purchase options on some of our leased equipment 

  

other – other expenses include state and local taxes freight equipment and property damage utilities insurance personal injury environmental employee travel telephone and cellular computer software bad debt and other general expenses  other expenses were flat in 2015 compared to 2014 as higher property taxes were offset by lower costs in other areas 

  

higher property taxes personal injury expense and utilities costs partially offset by lower environmental expense and costs associated with damaged freight resulted in an increase in other costs in 2014 compared to 2013 

  

nonoperating items 

  

  



  

other income – other income increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a 113 million gain from a real estate sale in the second quarter of 2015  partially offset by a gain from the sale of a permanent easement in 2014  

  

other income increased in 2014 versus 2013 due to higher gains from real estate sales and a sale of a permanent easement these gains were partially offset by higher environmental costs on nonoperating property in 2014 and lower lease income due to the 17 million settlement of a land lease contract in 2013 

  

interest expense – interest expense increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to an increased weightedaverage debt level of  130 billion in 2015 from 10 7 billion in 2014 partially offset by the impact of a lower effective interest rate of 48  in 2015 compared to 53 in 2014   

  

interest expense increased in 2014 versus 2013 due to an increased weightedaverage debt level of 107 billion in 2014 from 96 billion in 2013 which more than offset the impact of the lower effective interest rate of 53 in 2014 versus 57 in 2013 

 

income taxes – lower pretax income decreased income taxes in 2015 compared to 2014 our effective tax rate for 2015 was 377 compared to 379 in 2014 

  

higher pretax income increased income taxes in 2014 compared to 2013 our effective tax rate for 2014 was 379 compared to 377 in 2013 

  

other operatingperformance and financial statistics 

  

we report a number of key performance measures weekly to the association of american railroads we provide this data on our website at wwwupcominvestoraarstbreportsindexhtm 

  

operatingperformance statistics 

  

railroad performance measures are included in the table below 

  

  



  

average train speed – average train speed is calculated by dividing train miles by hours operated on our main lines between terminals average train speed as reported to the association of american railroads improved 6 in 2015 compared to 2014 velocity gains resulted from lower volumes improved network fluidity and a strong resource position more favorable weather conditions in the first quarter of 2015 also contributed to the improvement in our average train speed 

  

average train speed decreased 8 in 2014 versus 2013 the decline was as result of a 7 volume increase a major infrastructure project in fort worth texas and inclement weather including flooding in the midwest in the second quarter and severe weather conditions in the first quarter that impacted all major us and canadian railroads 

  

average terminal dwell time – average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our terminals lower average terminal dwell time improves asset utilization and service average terminal dwell time improved 3 in 2015 compared to 2014 reflecting the impact of lower volume and improved network operations 

  

average terminal dwell time increased 12 in 2014 compared to 2013 caused by higher volumes and inclement weather 

  

gross and revenue tonmiles – gross tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled revenue tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles gross tonmiles and revenue tonmiles decreased 9 and 12 respectively in 2015 compared to 2014 resulting from a 6 decrease in carloads changes in commodity mix drove the variances in yearoveryear declines between gross tonmiles revenue tonmiles and carloads 

  

gross tonmiles revenue tonmiles and carloadings all increased 7 in 2014 compared to 2013 

  

operating ratio – operating ratio is our operating expenses reflected as a percentage of operating revenue our operating ratio improved 04 points to a new record low of 631 in 2015 compared to 2014 c ore pricing gains the impact of lower fuel prices resource realignments network efficiencies   and productivity gains more than   offset the impact of lower volume and inflation 

  

our operating ratio improved 26 points to 63 5 in 2014 versus 2013 core pricing business demand and productivity more than offset the incremental operating costs associated with volume a slower network weather and inflation 

  

 

employees – employee levels increased 1 in 2015 compared to 2014 driven by more employees in training and an increase in capital project work more employees were in training as a result of the number of transportation employees hired during the last half of 2014 and early 2015 to handle expected volume increases and who continued receiving training in 2015  most of which occurred in the first nine months of the year 

  

employee levels increased 2 in 2014 versus 2013 a decrease in our capital workforce due to improved productivity and project mix partially offset the larger train and engine workforce required for higher volume levels and a slower network we successfully managed the growth of our fulltime equivalent train and engine force levels at a rate less than our volume growth in 2014

adjusted debt to capital is a nongaap financial measure under sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the total amount of leverage in our capital structure including offbalance sheet lease obligations which we generally incur in connection with financing the acquisition of locomotives and freight cars and certain facilities operating leases were discounted using 48 and 53 at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively the discount rate reflects our effective interest rate we monitor the ratio of adjusted debt to capital as we manage our capital structure to balance costeffective and efficient access to the capital markets with our overall cost of capital adjusted debt to capital should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for debt to capital the tables above provide reconciliations from debt to capital to adjusted debt to capital our december 31 2015 debt to capital ratios increased as a result of a 28 billion increase in debt from december 31 2014 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

as of december 31 2015 our principal sources of liquidity included cash cash equivalents our receivables securitization facility and our revolving credit facility as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets we had 17 billion of committed credit available under our credit facility with no borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2015 we did not make any borrowings under this facility during 2015 the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the 650 million capacity receivables securitization facility was 400 million as of december 31 2015 and is included in our consolidated statements of financial position as debt due after one year our access to this receivables securitization facility may be reduced or restricted if our bond ratings fall to certain levels below investment grade if our bond rating were to deteriorate it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financings is dependent on market conditions deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability we expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity through any or all of the following sources or activities i increasing the size or utilization of our receivables securitization ii issuing commercial paper iii entering into bank loans outside of our revolving credit facility or iv issuing bonds or other debt securities to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets the company’s 17 billion revolving credit facility is intended to support the issuance of commercial paper by upc and also serves as an emergency source of liquidity the company currently does not intend to make any borrowings under this facility 

  

 

at december 31 2015 and 2014 we had a modest working capital surplus this reflects a strong cash position that provides enhanced liquidity in an uncertain economic environment in addition we believe we have adequate access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

  

  



  

operating activities 

  

cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower net income and changes in working capital partially offset by the timing of tax payments 

  

federal tax law provided for 100 bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2011 and 50 bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 20122013 as a result the company deferred a substantial portion of its 20112013 income tax expense contributing to the positive operating cash flow in those years congress extended 50 bonus depreciation for 2014 but this extension occurred in december and the related benefit was realized in 2015 rather than 2014 similarly in december of 2015 congress extended bonus depreciation through 2019 which delayed the benefit of 2015 bonus depreciation into 2016 bonus depreciation will be at a rate of 50 for 2015 2016 and 2017 40 for 2018 and 30 for 2019 

  

higher net income in 2014 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2013 despite higher income tax payments 2014 income tax payments were higher than 2013 primarily due to higher income but also because we paid taxes previously deferred by bonus depreciation 

  

investing activities 

  

higher capital investments in locomotives and freight cars including 327 million in early lease buyouts   which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions   drove the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 

  

higher capital investments including the early buyout of the longterm operating lease of our headquarters building for approximately 261 million drove the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 significant investments also were made for new locomotives freight cars and containers and capacity and commercial facility projects capital investments in 2014 also included 99 million for the early buyout of locomotives and freight cars under longterm operating leases which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions 

  

 

the following tables detail cash capital investments and track statistics for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 

  

  



  







  

  



  

capital plan – in 2016 we expect our capital plan to be approximately 37 5 bi llion which may be revised if business conditions or the regulatory environment affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments while asset replacements will fluctuate as part of our renewal strategy we expect to use 55 to 60 of our capital investments to renew and improve existing capital assets we will continue to invest in our network and terminals where appropriate balancing terminal capacity with mainline capacity significant investments in technology improvements are planned including approximately 375 million for ptc we will also continue commercial investments in rail facilities and equipment including 230 locomotives and 450 freight cars 

  

we expect to fund our 2016 cash capital plan by using some or all of the following cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and cash on hand our annual capital plan is a critical component of our longterm strategic plan we expect our plan will enhance the longterm value of the company for our shareholders by providing sufficient resources to i replace and improve our existing track infrastructure to provide safe and fluid operations ii increase network efficiency by adding or improving facilities and track and iii make investments that meet customer demand and take advantage of opportunities for longterm growth 

  

financing activities 

  

cash used in financing activities increased in 2015 compared to 2014 an increase of 712 million in dividends paid and 240 million for the repurchase of shares under our common stock repurchase program more than offset an increase of 740 million in debt issued and a decrease of 154 million in debt repaid the higher dividend payments primarily were a result of adjusting the dividend payable dates to align with the timing of the quarterly dividend declaration and payment within the same quarter aligning the quarterly dividend declaration and payment resulted in two payments in the first quarter of 2015 the fourth quarter 2014 dividend of 438 million which was paid on january 2 2015 as well as the first quarter 2015 dividend of 484 million which was paid on march 30 2015 the second quarter 2015 dividend of 479 million was paid on june 30 2015 the third quarter 2015 dividend of 476 million was paid on september 30 2015 and the fourth quarter 2015 dividend of 467 million was paid on december 31 2015 higher dividends per share also contributed to the increase in dividends paid 

  

 

cash used in financing activities remained flat in 2014 versus 2013 increases for the repurchase of shares under our common stock repurchase program and higher dividend payments in 2014 of 16 billion compared to 13 billion in 2013 were offset by higher debt issuances in 2014 

  

credit facilities – at december 31 2015 we had 17 billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility the facility which is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper we did not draw on the facility during 2015 commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investmentgrade borrowers the facility allows for borrowings at floating rates based on london interbank offered rates plus a spread depending upon credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt the facility matures in may 2019 under a fiveyear term and requires upc to maintain a debttonetworth coverage ratio at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 and at all times during the periods presented we were in compliance with this covenant 

  

the definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the debttonetworth coverage ratio includes among other things certain credit arrangements capital leases guarantees and unfunded and vested pension benefits under title iv of erisa at december 31 2015 the debttonetworth coverage ratio allowed us to carry up to 414 billion of debt as defined in the facility and we had 143 billion of debt as defined in the facility outstanding at that date under our current capital plans we expect to continue to satisfy the debttonetworth coverage ratio however many factors beyond our reasonable control could affect our ability to comply with this provision in the future the facility does not include any other financial restrictions credit rating triggers other than ratingdependent pricing or any other provision that could require us to post collateral the facility also includes a 125 million crossdefault provision and a changeofcontrol provision 

  

during 2015 we did not issue or repay any commercial paper and at december 31 2015 and 2014 we had no commercial paper outstanding our revolving credit facility supports our outstanding commercial paper balances and unless we change the terms of our commercial paper program our aggregate issuance of commercial paper will not exceed the amount of borrowings available under the facility 

  

see further discussion in this item 7 under receivables securitization facility for information regarding the company’s receivables securitization facility 

  

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

  

for each of the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 116 135 and 118 respectively the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis earnings represent income from continuing operations less equity earnings net of distributions plus fixed charges and income taxes fixed charges represent interest charges amortization of debt discount and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges see exhibit 12 to this report for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

  

common shareholders’ equity 

  

dividend restrictions – our revolving credit facility includes a debttonet worth covenant discussed in the credit facilities section above that under certain circumstances restricts the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders the amount of retained earnings available for dividends was 136 billion and 154 billion at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively 

  

 

share repurchase program 

  

effective january 1 2014 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 120 million shares of our common stock by december 31 2017 replacing our previous repurchase program as of december 31 2015 we repurchased a total of 160 billion of our common stock since the commencement of our repurchase programs in 2007 the table below represents shares repurchased under this repurchase program 

  

  



  

managements assessments of market conditions and other pertinent facts guide the timing and volume of all repurchases we expect to fund any share repurchases under this program through cash generated from operations the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties debt issuances and cash on hand repurchased shares are recorded in treasury stock at cost which includes any applicable commissions and fees 

  

from jan uary 1 2016 through february 4  2016 we repurchased 3 7 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately 2 68 million 

  

shelf registration statement and significant new borrowings – we filed a new shelf registration statement with the sec that became effective on february 9 2015 the board of directors authorized the issuance of up to 40 billion of debt securities replacing the 40 billion authorized under our shelf registration filed in february 2013 which was fully utilized after our january 2015 debt offering noted below under our current shelf registration we may issue from time to time any combination of debt securities preferred stock common stock or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings we have no immediate plans to issue equity securities however we will continue to explore opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under our shelf registration and therefore we may issue additional debt securities at any time 

  

during 2015 we issued the following unsecured fixedrate debt securities under our shelf registrations 

  

  



  

we used the net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes including the repurchase of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program these debt securities include changeofcontrol provisions at december 31 2015 we had remaining authority to issue up to 22 billion of debt securities under our current shelf registration 

  

equipment trust – on may 12 2015 uprr consummated a passthrough pt financing whereby a pt trust was created which issued 399 million of pt trust certificates with a stated interest rate of 2695 the pt trust certificates will mature on may 12 2027 the proceeds from the issuance of the pt trust certificates were used to purchase equipment trust certificates to be issued by uprr to finance the acquisition of 182 locomotives the equipment trust certificates are secured by a lien on the 

 

locomotives the 399 million is classified as debt due after one year in our consolidated statements of financial position 

  

debt exchange – on august 21 2013 we exchanged 1170 million of various outstanding notes and debentures due between 2016 and 2040 the existing notes for 439 million of 3646 notes the new 2024 notes due february 15 2024 and 700 million of 4821 notes the new 2044 notes due february 1 2044 plus cash consideration of approximately 280 million in addition to 8 million for accrued and unpaid interest on the existing notes in accordance with asc 4705040 debtmodifications and extinguishmentsderecognition this transaction was accounted for as a debt exchange as the exchanged debt instruments are not considered to be substantially different the cash consideration was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of debt and the balance of the unamortized discount and issue costs from the existing notes is being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the terms of the new 2024 notes and the new 2044 notes no gain or loss was recognized as a result of the exchange costs related to the debt exchange that were payable to parties other than the debt holders totaled approximately 9 million and were included in interest expense during the year ended december 31 2013 

  

the following table lists the outstanding notes and debentures that were exchanged 

  

  



  

receivables securitization facility – the railroad maintains a 650 million 3year receivables securitization facility maturing in july 2017 under which it sells most of its eligible thirdparty receivables to union pacific receivables inc upri a consolidated whollyowned bankruptcyremote subsidiary that may subsequently transfer without recourse an undivided interest in accounts receivable to investors the investors have no recourse to the railroad’s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims creditors of the railroad do not have recourse to the assets of upri 

  

the amount outstanding under the facility was 400 million at both december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively the facility was supported by 09 billion and 12 billion of accounts receivable as collateral at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively which as a retained interest is included in accounts receivable net in our consolidated statements of financial position 

  

the outstanding amount the railroad is allowed to maintain under the facility with a maximum of 650 million may fluctuate based on the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by business volumes and credit risks including receivables payment quality measures such as default and dilution ratios if default or dilution ratios increase one percent the allowable outstanding amount under the facility would not materially change 

  

the costs of the receivables securitization facility include interest which will vary based on prevailing benchmark and commercial paper rates program fees paid to participating banks commercial paper issuance costs and fees of participating banks for unused commitment availability the costs of the receivables securitization facility are included in interest expense and were  5 million 4 million and 5 million for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

  

as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and as referenced in the tables below we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments including material sources of offbalance sheet and structured finance arrangements other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets as described in item 1a of part ii of this report there is no known trend demand commitment event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition our commercial obligations financings and commitments are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations particularly within the transportation industry 

  

the following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of december 31 2015 

  

  



  













  

  



  









  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

guarantees – at december 31 2015 and 2014 we were contingently liable for 53 million and 82 million in guarantees we have recorded liabilities of 0 and 03 million for the fair value of these obligations as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business and they include guaranteed obligations related to our affiliated operations the final guarantee expires in 2022 we are not aware of any existing event of 

 

default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

other matters 

  

labor agreements – approximately 85 of our 47457 fulltimeequivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions on january 1 2015 current labor agreements became subject to modification and we began the current round of negotiations with the unions existing agreements remain in effect until new agreements are reached or the railway labor act’s procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential emergency boards and congressional intervention are exhausted contract negotiations historically continue for an extended period of time and we rarely experience work stoppages while negotiations are pending 

  

inflation – long periods of inflation significantly increase asset replacement costs for capitalintensive companies as a result assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels depreciation charges on an inflationadjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 

  

derivative financial instruments – we may use derivative financial instruments in limited instances to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and fuel prices we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged both at inception and throughout the hedged period we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items at inception as well as our riskmanagement objectives strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness changes in the fair market value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are charged to earnings we may use swaps collars futures andor forward contracts to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in interest rates and fuel prices however the use of these derivative financial instruments may limit future benefits from favorable price movements 

  

market and credit risk – we address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item we manage credit risk related to derivative financial instruments which is minimal by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements at december 31 2015 and 2014 we were not required to provide collateral nor had we received collateral relating to our hedging activities 

  

determination of fair value – we determine the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or the present value of expected future cash flows 

  

sensitivity analyses – the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 

  

at december 31 2015 we had variablerate debt representing approximately 42 of our total debt if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2016 than our december 31 2015 variable rate which was approximately 11 our interest expense would increase by approximately 6 million this amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balances of our variablerate debt at december 31 2015 

  

market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2015 and amounts to an increase of approximately 16 billion to the fair value of our debt at december 31 2015 we estimated the fair values of our fixedrate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 

  

interest rate fair value hedges – we manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period we generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings we employ derivatives primarily swaps as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix in addition we also obtain flexibility in 

 

managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixedrate debt securities 

  

swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt’s fair value attributable to the changes in interest rates we account for swaps as fair value hedges using the shortcut method as allowed by the derivatives and hedging topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb asc 815 therefore we do not record any ineffectiveness within our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2015 and 2014 we had no interest rate fair value hedges outstanding 

  

interest rate cash flow hedges – we report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affects earnings as of december 31 2015 and 2014 we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding 

  

accounting pronouncements – in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201409 asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  asu 201409 supersedes the revenue recognition guidance in topic 605 revenue recognition the core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in the exchange for those goods or services this standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and can be adopted either retrospectively or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption asu 201409 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in april 2015 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201503 asu 201503 interest  imputation of interest subtopic 83530  asu 201503 changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements to present such costs as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset amortization of debt issuance costs will be reported as interest expense this standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2015 we elected to early adopt asu 201503 on december 31 2015 as a result the company reclassified debt issuance costs from other assets to a direct deduction from debt due after one year on the consolidated statements of financial position asu 201503 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and had no impact on our results of operations or cash flows all prior period financial information presented herein has been adjusted to reflect the retrospective application of this asu 

  

in november 2015 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201517 asu 201517 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes subtopic 74010  asu 201517 simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by eliminating the requirement for companies to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent on the consolidated statements of financial position instead companies will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent this guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2016 and early adoption is permitted we elected to early adopt asu 201517 on december 31 2015 asu 201517 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and had no impact on our results of operations or cash flows  all prior period financial information presented herein has been adjusted to reflect the retrospective application of this asu 

  

in january 2016 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201601 asu 201601 recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities subtopic 82510  asu 201601 provides guidance for the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments this guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2017 and early adoption is not permitted asu 201601 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

asserted and unasserted claims – various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries we cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity to the extent possible we have recorded a liability where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated we do not expect that any known lawsuits claims environmental costs commitments contingent liabilities or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters 

 

indemnities – our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements including certain tax indemnifications can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions 

  

climate change – although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item 1a of this report we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact however we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment including investments in new technologies using training programs to reduce fuel consumption and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency 

  

cr itical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 2 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 these critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 

  

personal injury – the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability including unasserted claims the federal employers’ liability act fela governs compensation for workrelated accidents under fela damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or outofcourt settlements we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 

  

our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments approximately 94 of the recorded liability is related to asserted claims and approximately 6 is related to unasserted claims at december 31 2015 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 318 million to 345 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation 

  

our personal injury liability activity was as follows 

  

  

  



  

 

our personal injury claims activity was as follows 

  

  



  

in conjunction with the liability update performed in 2015 we also reassessed our estimated insurance recoveries we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2015 and 2014 

  

asbestos – we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other parties allege exposure to asbestos we assess our potential liability using a statistical analysis of resolution costs for asbestosrelated claims this liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing costs the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions 

  









  

our liability for asbestosrelated claims is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments approximately 22 of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 78 related to unasserted claims at december 31 2015 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestosrelated claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 120 million to 129 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other 

  

our asbestosrelated liability activity was as follows 

  

  



  

our asbestosrelated claims activity was as follows 

  

  



  

in conjunction with the liability update performed in 2015 we also reassessed our estimated insurance recoveries we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2015 and 2014 the amounts recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts however future events such as the number of new claims filed each year average settlement costs and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts estimates also may vary in the future if strategies activities and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change federal and state laws 

 

governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimants and there are material changes with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants 

  

environmental costs – we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations we have identified 290 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements this includes 31 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government 19 of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 

  

when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in our business we perform with assistance of our consultants environmental assessments on the property we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated our environmental liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments 

  

our environmental liability activity was as follows 

  

  



  

our environmental site activity was as follows 

  

  



  

the environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties cost estimates are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and existing technology laws and regulations the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties sitespecific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal state and local laws governing environmental remediation current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

  

property and depreciation – our railroad operations are highly capital intensive and our large base of homogeneous networktype assets turns over on a continuous basis each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated service lives which are measured in years except for rail in highdensity traffic corridors ie all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment yard and switching tracks and electronic yards for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics use and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources not as singular items we currently have more than 60 depreciable 

 

asset classes and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology asset strategies or other factors 

  

we determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property by means of depreciation studies we perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets ie rail and other track material ties and ballast and other road property our depreciation studies take into account the following factors 

  









  

for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track it has been our experience that the lives of rail in highdensity traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage ie the amount of weight carried over the rail the service lives also vary based on rail weight rail condition eg new or secondhand and rail type eg straight or curve our depreciation studies for rail in highdensity traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross tonmiles carried over the rail ie the weight of loaded and empty freight cars locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile  rail in highdensity traffic corridors accounts for approximately 70 percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material based on the number of gross tonmiles carried over our rail in high density traffic corridors during 2015 the estimated service lives of the majority of this rail ranged from approximately 19 years to approximately 39 years for all other depreciable assets we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively 

  

estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to changes in physical use technology asset strategies and other factors that will have an impact on the retirement profiles of our assets we are not aware of any specific factors that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service lives of our assets actual use and retirement of our assets may vary from our current estimates which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future periods 

  

changes in estimated useful lives of our assets due to the results of our depreciation studies could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately 66 million if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were decreased by one year annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately 70 million  our recent depreciation studies have resulted in lower depreciation rates for some asset classes the se lower rates will partially offset the impact of a projected higher depreciable asset base  resulting in an increase in total depreciation expense by approximately 1 to 2 in 2016 versus 2015 

  

under group depreciation the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using i inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ii the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate in addition we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies any deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets 

  

 

for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions i it is unusual ii it is material in amount and iii it varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies during the last three fiscal years no gains or losses were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad properties a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations 

  

income taxes – we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns these expected future tax consequences are measured based on current tax law the effects of future tax legislation are not anticipated future tax legislation such as a change in the corporate tax rate could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity for example a 1 increase in future income tax rates would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately 390 million 

  

when appropriate we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reflect that these tax assets may not be realized in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized based on management’s judgments using available evidence for purposes of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize a deferred tax asset in 2015 and 2014 there were no valuation allowances 

  

we recognize tax benefits that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement a liability for “unrecognized tax benefits” is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards 

  

pension and other postretirement benefits – we use an actuarial analysis to measure the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and medical and life insurance benefits opeb to eligible employees in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make several assumptions the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets for opeb the critical assumptions are the discount rate and health care cost trend rate 

  

we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually and selected assumptions are based on the following factors 

  







  

the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit for 2015 and the estimated impact on 2015 net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit relative to a change in those assumptions 

  

  



  

  

 



  

the following table presents the net periodic pension and opeb cost for the years ended december 31 

  

  



  

in 2016 we will measure the service cost and interest cost components of our net periodic benefit cost by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year instead of a single weightedaverage discount rate approach our net periodic pension cost is expected to decrease to approximately 42 million in 2016 from 120 million in 2015 our net periodic opeb expense is expected to decrease to approximately 13 million in 2016 from 19 million in 2015

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the companys principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the companys board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

operations 

the railroad along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates is our one reportable operating segment although we provide revenue by commodity group we analyze the net financial results of the railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of our rail network additional information regarding our business and operations including revenue and financial information and data and other information regarding environmental matters is presented in risk factors item 1a legal proceedings item 3 selected financial data item 6 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item 7 and the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 which include information regarding revenues statements of income and total assets 

  

 commodities such as lumber steel paper food and chemicals the transportation of finished vehicles auto parts intermodal containers and truck trailers are included as part of our premium business in 2014 we generated freight revenues totaling 226 billion from the following six commodity groups 

agricultural products – transportation of grains commodities produced from these grains and food and beverage products generated 17 of the railroad’s 2014 freight revenue the company accesses most major grain markets linking the midwest and western us producing areas to export terminals in the pacific northwest and gulf coast ports as well as mexico we also serve significant domestic markets including grain processors animal feeders and ethanol producers in the midwest west south and rocky mountain states unit trains which transport a single commodity between producers and export terminals or domestic markets represent approximately 42 of our agricultural shipments 

automotive – we are the largest automotive carrier west of the mississippi river and operate or access over 40 vehicle distribution centers the railroad’s extensive franchise serves five vehicle assembly plants and connects to west coast ports mexico gateways and the gulf of mexico to accommodate both import and export shipments in addition to transporting finished vehicles uprr provides expedited handling of automotive parts in both boxcars and intermodal containers destined for mexico the us and canada the automotive group generated 9 of union pacific’s freight revenue in 2014 

chemicals – transporting chemicals generated 16 of our freight revenue in 2014 the railroad’s unique franchise serves the chemical producing areas along the gulf coast where roughly 60 of the company’s chemical business originates terminates or travels our chemical franchise also accesses chemical producers in the rocky mountains and on the west coast the company’s chemical shipments include four broad categories petrochemicals fertilizer soda ash and other petrochemicals include industrial chemicals plastics and petroleum products including crude oil and liquid petroleum gases currently these products move primarily to and from the gulf coast region fertilizer movements originate in the gulf coast region the western us and canada through interline access for delivery to major agricultural users in the midwest western us as well as abroad soda ash originates in southwestern wyoming and california destined for chemical and glass producing markets in north america and abroad other shipments include sodium products phosphorus rock and sulfur 

coal – shipments of coal and petroleum coke accounted for 18 of our freight revenue in 2014 the railroad’s network supports the transportation of coal and petroleum coke to independent and regulated power companies and industrial facilities throughout the us through interchange gateways and ports uprr’s reach extends to eastern us utilities mexico europe and asia water terminals allow the railroad to move western us coal east via the mississippi and ohio rivers as well as the great lakes export coal moves through west coast ports to asia and through the mississippi river and houston to europe coal traffic originating in the southern powder river basin sprb area of wyoming is the largest segment of the railroad’s coal business 

industrial products – our extensive network facilitates the movement of numerous commodities between thousands of origin and destination points throughout north america the industrial products group consists of several categories including construction products minerals consumer goods metals 

  

lumber paper and other miscellaneous products in 2014 this group generated 20 of union pacific’s total freight revenue commercial residential and governmental infrastructure investments drive shipments of steel aggregates cement components cement and wood products oil and gas drilling generates demand for raw steel finished pipe frac sand stone and drilling fluid commodities industrial and light manufacturing plants receive steel nonferrous materials minerals and other raw materials paper and packaging commodities as well as appliances move to major metropolitan areas for consumers lumber shipments originate primarily in the pacific northwest and western canada and move throughout the us for use in new home construction and repair and remodeling 

intermodal – our intermodal business includes two segments international and domestic international business consists of import and export container traffic that mainly passes through west coast ports served by uprr’s extensive terminal network domestic business includes container and trailer traffic picked up and delivered within north america for intermodal marketing companies primarily shipper agents and logistics companies as well as truckload carriers lessthantruckload and package carriers with timesensitive business requirements are also an important part of domestic shipments together international and domestic business generated 20 of upc’s 2014 freight revenue 

seasonality – some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons reflecting either or both the nature of the commodity such as certain agricultural and food products that have specific growing and harvesting seasons and the demand cycle for the commodity such as intermodal traffic that generally peaks during the third quarter to meet holidayrelated demand for consumer goods during the fourth quarter the peak shipping seasons for these commodities can vary considerably each year depending upon various factors including the strength of domestic and international economies and currencies and the strength of harvests and market prices for agricultural products in response to an annual request from the surface transportation board stb of the us department of transportation dot to all of the class i railroads operating in the us we submit a publicly available letter during the third quarter detailing our plans for handling traffic during the third and fourth quarters and providing other information requested by the stb 

working capital – at december 31 2014 and 2013 we had a modest working capital surplus which provides enhanced liquidity in addition we believe we have adequate access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

competition – we are subject to competition from other railroads motor carriers ship and barge operators and pipelines our main railroad competitor is burlington northern santa fe llc its primary subsidiary bnsf railway company bnsf operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors in addition we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers motor carrier competition exists for five of our six commodity groups excluding most coal shipments because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and gulf coast waterways barges can be particularly competitive especially for grain and bulk commodities in certain areas where we operate in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times quality and reliability of service from motor carriers and other railroads motor carriers in particular can have an advantage over railroads with respect to transit times and timeliness of service however railroads are much more fuelefficient than trucks which reduces the impact of transporting goods on the environment and public infrastructure and we have been making efforts to convert certain truck traffic to rail additionally we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any of the following could also affect the competitiveness of our transportation services for some or all of our commodities i improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation ii legislation that eliminates or significantly reduces the size or weight limitations applied to motor carriers or iii legislation or regulatory changes that impose operating restrictions on railroads or that adversely affect the profitability of some or all railroad traffic for more information regarding risks we face from competition see the risk factors in item 1a of this report 

key suppliers – we depend on two key domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives due to the capital intensive nature of the locomotive manufacturing business and sophistication of this equipment potential new suppliers face high barriers of entry into this industry therefore if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives for any reason including insolvency or bankruptcy we could experience a significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations additionally for a high percentage of our rail purchases we utilize two steel 

  

producers one domestic and one international that meet our specifications rail is critical for maintenance replacement improvement and expansion of our network and facilities rail manufacturing also has high barriers of entry and if one of those suppliers discontinues operations for any reason including insolvency or bankruptcy we could experience cost increases and difficulty obtaining rail 

employees – approximately 85 of our 47201 fulltimeequivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions on january 1 2015 current labor agreements became subject to modification and we began the current round of negotiations with the unions existing agreements remain in effect until new agreements are reached or the railway labor act’s procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential emergency boards and congressional intervention are exhausted contract negotiations historically continue for an extended period of time and we rarely experience work stoppages while negotiations are pending 

railroad security – our security efforts consist of a wide variety of measures including employee training engagement with our customers training of emergency responders and partnerships with numerous federal state and local government agencies while federal law requires us to protect the confidentiality of our security plans designed to safeguard against terrorism and other security incidents the following provides a general overview of our security initiatives 

uprr security measures – we maintain a comprehensive security plan designed to both deter and respond to any potential or actual threats as they arise the plan includes four levels of alert status each with its own set of countermeasures we employ our own police force consisting of more than 200 commissioned and highlytrained officers our employees also undergo recurrent security and preparedness training as well as federallymandated hazardous materials and security training we regularly review the sufficiency of our employee training programs we maintain the capability to move critical operations to backup facilities in different locations 

we operate an emergency response management center 24 hours a day the center receives reports of emergencies dangerous or potentially dangerous conditions and other safety and security issues from our employees the public and law enforcement and other government officials in cooperation with government officials we monitor both threats and public events and as necessary we may alter rail traffic flow at times of concern to minimize risk to communities and our operations we comply with the hazardous materials routing rules and other requirements imposed by federal law we also design our operating plan to expedite the movement of hazardous material shipments to minimize the time rail cars remain idle at yards and terminals located in or near major population centers additionally in compliance with transportation security agency regulations we deployed information systems and instructed employees in tracking and documenting the handoff of rail security sensitive materials with customers and interchange partners 

we also have established a number of our own innovative safety and securityoriented initiatives ranging from various investments in technology to the officer on the train program which provides local law enforcement officers with the opportunity to ride with train crews to enhance their understanding of railroad operations and risks our staff of information security professionals continually assesses cyber security risks and implements mitigation programs that evolve with the changing technology threat environment to date we have not experienced any material disruption of our operations due to a cyber threat or attack directed at us 

cooperation with federal state and local government agencies – we work closely on physical and cyber security initiatives with government agencies including the dot and the department of homeland security dhs as well as local police departments fire departments and other first responders in conjunction with the association of american railroads aar we sponsor ask rail a mobile application which provides first responders with secure links to electronic information including commodity and emergency response information required by emergency personnel to respond to accidents and other situations we also participate in the national joint terrorism task force a multiagency effort established by the us department of justice and the federal bureau of investigation to combat and prevent terrorism 

we work with the coast guard us customs and border protection cbp and the military transport management command which monitor shipments entering the uprr rail network at us border crossings and ports we were the first railroad in the us to be named a partner in cbp’s customs 

  

trade partnership against terrorism a partnership designed to develop enhance and maintain effective security processes throughout the global supply chain 

cooperation with customers and trade associations – through transcaer transportation community awareness and emergency response we work with the aar the american chemistry council the american petroleum institute and other chemical trade groups to provide communities with preparedness tools including the training of emergency responders in cooperation with the federal railroad administration fra and other interested groups we are also working to develop additional improvements to tank car design that will further limit the risk of releases of hazardous materials 

governmental and environmental regulation 

governmental regulation – our operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local regulations generally applicable to all businesses see also the discussion of certain regulatory proceedings in legal proceedings item 3 

the operations of the railroad are also subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the stb the stb has jurisdiction over rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic common carrier service of regulated traffic freight car compensation transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines and acquisition of control of rail common carriers in 2014 the stb continued its efforts to explore whether to expand rail regulation the stb has requested parties to discuss the stb’s methodology for determining railroad revenue adequacy and the possible use of a revenue adequacy constraint in regulating railroad rates the stb also held hearings to evaluate the potential impact of expanded reciprocal switching arrangements on railroads for the past several legislative sessions proposed bills have been introduced in congress that aim to alter the regulatory structure of the railroad industry we will continue to monitor any legislative activity involving rail and transportation regulation and respond accordingly 

the operations of the railroad also are subject to the regulations of the fra and other federal and state agencies on january 12 2010 the fra issued initial rules governing installation of positive train control ptc by the end of 2015 the final regulation was issued on august 8 2014 although still under development ptc is a collision avoidance technology intended to override engineer controlled locomotives and stop traintotrain and overspeed accidents misaligned switch derailments and unauthorized entry to work zones following the issuance of the initial rules the fra acknowledged that projected costs will exceed projected benefits by a ratio of at least 22 to one and we estimate that our costs will be higher than those assumed by the fra in august 2012 the fra provided congress with a status report regarding implementation of ptc this report indicated that the rail industry will likely achieve only partial deployment of ptc by the current deadline due to significant technical developments training and deployment and the delay in issuing the final rule through 2014 we have invested approximately 16 billion in the development of ptc the company is planning to submit its ptc safety plan to the fra in the second quarter of 2015 

on august 1 2014 the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa issued proposed rules concerning the transportation of certain flammable liquids the proposed rules include a variety of possible measures including tank car standards speed restrictions braking system requirements community notification and operating restrictions we along with others in the rail industry submitted comments concerning the proposed rules railroad operations for the entire industry could be impacted depending on the outcome of the final rules we will continue to monitor this rulemaking process 

dot the occupational safety and health administration phmsa and dhs along with other federal agencies have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety movement of hazardous materials and hazardous waste emissions requirements and equipment standards the rail safety improvement act of 2008 among other things revised hours of service rules for train and certain other railroad employees mandated implementation of ptc imposed passenger service requirements addressed safety at rail crossings increased the number of safety related employees of the fra and increased fines that may be levied against railroads for safety violations additionally various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law 

environmental regulation – we are subject to extensive federal and state environmental statutes and regulations pertaining to public health and the environment the statutes and regulations are 

  

administered and monitored by the environmental protection agency epa and by various state environmental agencies the primary laws affecting our operations are the resource conservation and recovery act regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act regulating the cleanup of contaminated properties the clean air act regulating air emissions and the clean water act regulating waste water discharges

the information set forth in this item 1a should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this report including management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item 7 and financial statements and supplementary data item 8 

we must manage fluctuating demand for our services and network capacity – if there is significant demand for our services that exceeds the designed capacity of our network we may experience network difficulties including congestion and reduced velocity that could compromise the level of service we provide to our customers this level of demand may also compound the impact of weather and weatherrelated events on our operations and velocity although we continue to improve our transportation plan add capacity improve operations at our yards and other facilities and improve our ability to address surges in demand for any reason with adequate resources we cannot be sure that these measures will fully or adequately address any service shortcomings resulting from demand exceeding our planned capacity we may experience other operational or service difficulties related to network capacity dramatic and unplanned fluctuations in demand for rail service with respect to one or more commodities or operating regions or other events that could negatively impact our operational efficiency any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in the event that we experience significant reductions in demand for rail services with respect to one or more commodities we may experience increased costs associated with resizing our operations including higher unit operating costs and costs for the storage of locomotives rail cars and other equipment workforce adjustments and other related activities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we transport hazardous materials – we transport certain hazardous materials and other materials including crude oil ethanol and toxic inhalation hazard tih materials such as chlorine that pose certain risks in the event of a release or combustion additionally us laws impose common carrier obligations on railroads that require us to transport certain hazardous materials regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss a rail accident or other incident or accident on our network at our facilities or at the facilities of our customers involving the release or combustion of hazardous materials could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury property damage and environmental penalties and remediation in excess of our insurance coverage for these risks which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to significant governmental regulation – we are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal state and local authorities covering a variety of health safety labor environmental economic as discussed below and other matters many laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses permits and other authorizations and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us governments or regulators may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate without providing us any recourse to address any adverse effects on our business including without limitation regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution business relationships with other railroads calculation of our cost of capital or other inputs relevant to computing our revenue adequacy the prices we charge and costs and expenses significant legislative activity in congress or regulatory activity by the stb could expand regulation of railroad operations and prices for rail services which could reduce capital spending on our rail network facilities and equipment and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity as part of the rail safety improvement act of 2008 rail carriers must currently implement ptc by the end of 2015 which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make other capital investments rail 

  

carriers likely will not meet the current mandatory deadline for ptc implementation due to various factors additionally one or more consolidations of class i railroads could also lead to increased regulation of the rail industry 

we may be affected by general economic conditions – prolonged severe adverse domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of financial and credit markets may affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry and may have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity and our results of operations and financial condition 

we face competition from other railroads and other transportation providers – we face competition from other railroads motor carriers ships barges and pipelines in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service while we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks barges and maritime operators are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation or legislation that eliminates or significantly reduces the burden of the size or weight limitations currently applicable to motor carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect the competitive environment in which we operate 

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures – as a railroad with a vast network we are exposed to severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods mudslides or landslides extreme temperatures and significant precipitation line outages and other interruptions caused by these conditions can adversely affect our entire rail network and can adversely affect revenue costs and liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations – we rely on information technology in all aspects of our business if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if we are unable to develop or implement new technology such as ptc or the latest version of our transportation control systems we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally if a cyber attack or other event causes significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment we could suffer a significant service interruption safety failure security breach or other operational difficulties which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures – as a railroad with operations in densely populated urban areas and other cities and a vast rail network we are exposed to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage environmental liability and other matters any material changes to litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving any or all of property damage personal injury and environmental liability that exceed our insurance coverage for such risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to significant environmental laws and regulations – due to the nature of the railroad business our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waters handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and hazardous material or petroleum releases we generate and transport hazardous and nonhazardous waste in our operations and we did so in our former operations environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties leased properties and properties owned by third parties as well as to properties we currently own environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation we have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated or are strictly liable under these laws or regulations we currently have certain obligations at existing sites for investigation remediation and monitoring and we likely will have obligations at other sites in the future liabilities for these obligations affect our estimate based on our experience and as necessary the advice and assistance of our consultants however actual costs may vary from our estimates due to any or all of several factors including changes to environmental laws or interpretations of such laws technological changes affecting investigations and remediation the 

  

participation and financial viability of other parties responsible for any such liability and the corrective action or change to corrective actions required to remediate any existing or future sites we could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we may be affected by climate change and market or regulatory responses to climate change – climate change including the impact of global warming could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gasses including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating costs restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that a use commodities that we carry to produce energy b use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry or c manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels including chemical producers farmers and food producers and automakers and other manufacturers significant cost increases government regulation or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns including for example the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers finally we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change any of these factors individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations – the us class i railroads are party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions the majority of our employees belong to labor unions and are subject to these agreements disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in among other things strikes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts which could cause a significant disruption of our operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could compromise our service reliability or significantly increase our costs for health care wages and other benefits which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

the availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations – changes in demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to meet demand for rail service unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we may be affected by fluctuating fuel prices – fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses diesel fuel prices can be subject to dramatic fluctuations and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results although we currently are able to recover a significant amount of our fuel expenses from our customers through revenue from fuel surcharges we cannot be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elevated fuel costs through our fuel surcharges additionally future market conditions or legislative or regulatory activities could adversely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharges or adequately recover increased fuel costs through fuel surcharges as fuel prices fluctuate our fuel surcharge programs trail such fluctuations in fuel price by approximately two months and may be a significant source of quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear volatility particularly in periods of rapidly changing prices international political and economic factors events and conditions affect the volatility of fuel prices and supplies weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity a severe shortage of or disruption to domestic fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity alternatively lower fuel prices could have a positive impact on the economy by increasing consumer discretionary spending that potentially could increase demand for various consumer products we transport however lower fuel prices could have a negative impact on other commodities we 

  

transport such as coal frac sand and crude oil shipments which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we utilize capital markets – due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements we utilize longterm debt instruments bank financing and commercial paper from timetotime and we pledge certain of our receivables significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets including the credit markets or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to and significantly increase the cost of commercial paper and other financing sources including bank credit facilities and the issuance of longterm debt including corporate bonds a significant deterioration of our financial condition could result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade which could restrict or at certain credit levels below investment grade may prohibit us from utilizing our current receivables securitization facility this may also limit our access to external sources of capital and significantly increase the costs of short and longterm debt financing 

a significant portion of our revenue involves transportation of commodities to and from international markets – although revenues from our operations are attributable to transportation services provided in the us a significant portion of our revenues involves the transportation of commodities to and from international markets including mexico and southeast asia by various carriers and at times various modes of transportation significant and sustained interruptions of trade with mexico or countries in southeast asia including china could adversely affect customers and other entities that directly or indirectly purchase or rely on rail transportation services in the us as part of their operations and any such interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity any one or more of the following could cause a significant and sustained interruption of trade with mexico or countries in southeast asia a a deterioration of security for international trade and businesses b the adverse impact of new laws rules and regulations or the interpretation of laws rules and regulations by government entities courts or regulatory bodies including taxing authorities that affect our customers doing business in foreign countries c any significant adverse economic developments such as extended periods of high inflation material disruptions in the banking sector or in the capital markets of these foreign countries and significant changes in the valuation of the currencies of these foreign countries that could materially affect the cost or value of imports or exports d shifts in patterns of international trade that adversely affect import and export markets and e a material reduction in foreign direct investment in these countries 

we are subject to legislative regulatory and legal developments involving taxes – taxes are a significant part of our expenses we are subject to us federal state and foreign income payroll property sales and use fuel and other types of taxes changes in tax rates enactment of new tax laws revisions of tax regulations and claims or litigation with taxing authorities could result in substantially higher taxes and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are dependent on certain key suppliers of locomotives and rail – due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry therefore if one of the domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives discontinues manufacturing locomotives for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience significant cost increases and reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary for our operations additionally for a high percentage of our rail purchases we utilize two steel producers one domestic and one international that meet our specifications rail is critical to our operations for rail replacement programs maintenance and for adding additional network capacity new rail and storage yards and expansions of existing facilities this industry similarly has high barriers to entry and if one of these suppliers discontinues operations for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience both significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail for maintenance and other projects 

we may be affected by acts of terrorism war or risk of war – our rail lines facilities and equipment including rail cars carrying hazardous materials could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks terrorist attacks or other similar events any government response thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in addition insurance premiums for some or all of our current coverages could increase dramatically or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future

environmental matters – certain of our properties are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment see discussion of environmental issues in business – governmental and environmental regulation item 1 and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies – environmental item 7 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation that occur in connection with our business we routinely assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest available information and when necessary we seek input from our thirdparty advisors when making these assessments consistent with sec rules and requirements we describe below material pending legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities other proceedings arising under federal state or local environmental laws and regulations including governmental proceedings involving potential fines penalties or other monetary sanctions in excess of 100000 and such other pending matters that we may determine to be appropriate 

  

environmental matters 

as previously reported in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2012 the illinois attorney general’s office notified uprr on january 14 2013 that it will seek a penalty against the railroad for environmental conditions caused by its predecessor at a former locomotive fueling facility in south pekin illinois this former cnw facility discontinued fueling operations in the early 1980s subsequent environmental investigation revealed evidence of fuel releases to soil and groundwater in january 2007 the state rejected uprr’s proposed compliance commitment agreement and responded with a notice of intent to pursue legal action uprr continued to perform remedial investigations under the supervision of the illinois epa in june 2012 the illinois epa approved uprr’s proposed remedial action plan for the site consisting of no further action and monitoring for a period of ten years subsequently the state notified uprr that it would seek to recover a civil penalty and during early negotiations it offered to settle its claim for 240000 uprr rejected this offer the state sued uprr on october 26 2013 in the circuit court for the tenth judicial circuit tazewell county illinois through continued settlement negotiations the parties have reached a tentative agreement to settle this matter in exchange for a payment by uprr of 100000 final terms for a written agreement are being developed 

we received notices from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are or may be liable under federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the us including sites on the superfund national priorities list or state superfund lists we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings and suits because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs 

information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies – environmental item 7 

other matters 

antitrust litigation – as we reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2007 20 rail shippers many of whom are represented by the same law firms filed virtually identical antitrust lawsuits in various federal district courts against us and four other class i railroads in the us currently uprr and three other class i railroads are the named defendants in the lawsuit the original plaintiff filed the first of these claims in the us district court in new jersey on may 14 2007 the number of complaints reached a total of 30 these suits allege that the named railroads engaged in pricefixing by establishing common fuel surcharges for certain rail traffic 

in addition to suits filed by direct purchasers of rail transportation services a few of the suits involved plaintiffs alleging that they are or were indirect purchasers of rail transportation and sought to represent a purported class of indirect purchasers of rail transportation services that paid fuel surcharges these complaints added allegations under state antitrust and consumer protection laws on november 6 2007 the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation ordered that all of the rail fuel surcharge cases be transferred to judge paul friedman of the us district court in the district of columbia for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings following numerous hearings and rulings judge friedman dismissed the complaints of the indirect purchasers which the indirect purchasers appealed on april 16 2010 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia affirmed judge friedman’s ruling dismissing the indirect purchasers’ claims based on various state laws 

with respect to the direct purchasers’ complaint judge friedman conducted a twoday hearing on october 6 and 7 2010 on the class certification issue and the railroad defendants’ motion to exclude evidence of interline communications on april 7 2011 judge friedman issued an order deferring any decision on class certification until the supreme court issued its decision in the walmart employment discrimination case 

on june 21 2012 judge friedman issued his decision which certified a class of plaintiffs with eight named plaintiff representatives the decision included in the class all shippers that paid a ratebased fuel surcharge to any one of the defendant railroads for rateunregulated rail transportation from july 1 2003 through december 31 2008 this was a procedural ruling which did not affirm any of the claims asserted by the plaintiffs and does not affect the ability of the railroad defendants to disprove the allegations made by the plaintiffs on july 5 2012 the defendant railroads filed a petition with the us court of appeals for 

  

the district of columbia requesting that the court review the class certification ruling on august 28 2012 a panel of the circuit court of the district of columbia referred the petition to a merits panel of the court to address the issues in the petition and to address whether the district court properly granted class certification the circuit court heard oral arguments on may 3 2013 on august 9 2013 the circuit court vacated the class certification decision and remanded the case to the district court to reconsider the class certification decision in light of a recent supreme court case and incomplete consideration of errors in the expert report of the plaintiffs on october 31 2013 judge friedman approved a schedule agreed to by all parties for consideration of the class certification issue on remand 

on october 2 2014 the plaintiffs informed judge friedman that their economic expert had a previously undisclosed conflict of interest judge friedman ruled on november 26 2014 that the plaintiffs may file a supplemental expert report to support their motion for class certification the plaintiffs must file their supplemental expert report on or before april 1 2015 the defendant railroads will then have the opportunity to respond to the plaintiffs’ supplement report judge friedman has not yet set a new date to hear oral arguments on plaintiffs’ motion for class certification 

as we reported in our current report on form 8k filed on june 10 2011 the railroad received a complaint filed in the us district court for the district of columbia on june 7 2011 by oxbow carbon  minerals llc and related entities oxbow the complaint named the railroad and one other us class i railroad as defendants and alleged that the named railroads engaged in pricefixing and monopolistic practices in connection with fuel surcharge programs and pricing of shipments of certain commodities including coal and petroleum coke the complaint sought injunctive relief and payment of damages of over 30 million and other unspecified damages including treble damages some of the allegations in the complaint were addressed in the existing fuel surcharge litigation referenced above the complaint also included additional unrelated allegations regarding alleged limitations on competition for shipments of oxbow’s commodities judge friedman who presides over the fuel surcharge matter described above also presides over this matter on february 26 2013 judge friedman granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss oxbow’s complaint for failure to state properly a claim under the antitrust laws however the dismissal was without prejudice to refile the complaint judge friedman approved a schedule that allowed oxbow to file a revised complaint which oxbow filed on may 1 2013 the amended complaint alleges that uprr and one other class i railroad violated sections 1 and 2 of the sherman antitrust act and that uprr also breached a tolling agreement between oxbow and uprr oxbow claims that it paid more than 50 million in wrongfully imposed fuel surcharges uprr and the other railroad filed separate motions to dismiss the oxbow revised complaint on july 1 2013 judge friedman heard oral arguments on the motions to dismiss filed by uprr and the other railroad on january 8 2015 

we deny the allegations that our fuel surcharge programs violate the antitrust laws or any other laws we believe that these lawsuits are without merit and we will vigorously defend our actions therefore we currently believe that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on any of our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

 free cash flow is not considered a financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe free cash flow is important to management and investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to 

  

generate cash without additional external financings free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for cash provided by operating activities the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities gaap measure to free cash flow nongaap measure 

 

 2015 outlook 

 

  

  

 lower fuel prices could have a positive impact on the economy by increasing consumer discretionary spending that potentially could increase demand for various consumer products that we transport alternatively lower fuel prices will likely have a negative impact on other commodities such as coal frac sand and crude oil shipments

 we generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our six commodity groups freight revenues vary with volume carloads and average revenue per car arc changes in price traffic mix and fuel surcharges drive arc we provide some of our customers with contractual incentives for meeting or exceeding specified cumulative volumes or shipping to and from specific locations which we record as reductions to freight revenues based on the actual or projected future shipments we recognize freight revenues as shipments move from origin to destination we allocate freight revenues between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them 

other revenues include revenues earned by our subsidiaries revenues from our commuter rail operations and accessorial revenues which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us or when we perform additional services such as switching or storage we recognize other revenues as we perform services or meet contractual obligations 

freight revenues from all six commodity groups increased during 2014 compared to 2013 driven by 7 volume growth and core pricing gains of 25 volume growth from grain frac sand rock and intermodal domestic and international shipments offset declines in crude oil 

freight revenues from five of our six commodity groups increased during 2013 compared to 2012 revenue from agricultural products was down slightly compared to 2012 arc increased 5 driven by core pricing gains shifts in business mix and an automotive logistics management arrangement volume essentially was flat year over year as growth in automotive frac sand crude oil and domestic intermodal offset declines in coal international intermodal and grain shipments 

our fuel surcharge programs generated freight revenues of 28 billion 26 billion and 26 billion in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively fuel surcharge in 2014 increased 6 driven by our 7 carloadings increase fuel surcharge in 2013 essentially was flat versus 2012 as lower fuel price offset improved fuel recovery provisions and the lag effect of our programs surcharges trail fluctuations in fuel price by approximately two months 

in 2014 other revenue increased from 2013 due to higher revenues at our subsidiaries primarily those that broker intermodal and automotive services accessorial revenue driven by increased volume and per diem revenue for container usage previously included in automotive freight revenue 

in 2013 other revenue increased from 2012 due primarily to miscellaneous contract revenue and higher revenues at our subsidiaries that broker intermodal and automotive services 

  

the following tables summarize the yearoveryear changes in freight revenues revenue carloads and arc by commodity type 

 

  

   

  

 higher arc due to price increases and the logistics management arrangement that covers fees and container costs coupled with increased shipments of automotive parts and finished vehicles improved automotive revenue in 2013 compared to 2012 higher production and sales levels during 2013 drove the volume growth 

 

 volume gains and price improvement increased freight revenue from chemicals in 2013 versus 2012 shipments of crude oil from the bakken permian niobrara and eagle ford shale formations primarily to the gulf area drove the growth in shipments of 

  

chemicals in addition shipments of industrial chemicals increased as manufacturing housing and automotive markets improved 

 

 arc gains driven by price increases and positive business mix partially offset by volume declines increased freight revenue from coal shipments in 2013 versus 2012 sprb shipments declined 10 from 2012 due to the loss of a customer contract at the beginning of the year relatively mild summer weather and tighter coal inventory management by utilities shipments from colorado and utah mines decreased 13 compared to 2012 driven by soft domestic demand and mine production issues partially offset by second half growth in international shipments severe flooding and washouts in colorado also reduced volumes from certain producers in the third quarter 

 

   

 compared to 2012 domestic traffic increased 3 due to overall economic growth along with conversions from truck transportation to rail international traffic declined 2 versus 2012 reflecting market share shifts within the ocean carrier industry and an increase in transloading in the second half of the year transloading involves the transfer of goods from international to domestic containers at distribution centers near west coast ports which reduces demand for rail transportation from these centers in international containers 

mexico business – each of our commodity groups includes revenue from shipments to and from mexico revenue from mexico business increased 8 to 23 billion in 2014 versus 2013 volume levels increased 8 from 2013 as increases in agricultural products chemicals intermodal automotive and industrial products offset lower export coal shipments 

revenue from mexico business increased 9 to 21 billion in 2013 versus 2012 shipments were up 3 versus 2012 all commodity groups grew with the exception of agricultural products the largest growth came from automotive and industrial products shipments 

  

operating expenses 

 

  

 compensation and benefits – compensation and benefits include wages payroll taxes health and welfare costs pension costs other postretirement benefits and incentive costs volumerelated expenses including training and a slower network increased our train and engine work force which along with general wage and benefit inflation drove increased wages weatherrelated costs in the first quarter of 2014 also increased costs 

general wages and benefits inflation including increased pension and other postretirement benefits and higher work force levels drove the increases in 2013 versus 2012 the impact of ongoing productivity initiatives partially offset these increases 

fuel – fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and nonhighway vehicles and heavy equipment volume growth of 7 as measured by gross tonmiles drove the increase in fuel expense this was essentially offset by lower locomotive diesel fuel prices which averaged 297 per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in 2014 compared to 315 in 2013 along with a slight improvement in fuel consumption rate computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross tonmiles 

lower locomotive diesel fuel prices which averaged 315 per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in 2013 compared to 322 in 2012 decreased expenses by 75 million volume as measured by gross tonmiles decreased 1 while the fuel consumption rate computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross tonmiles increased 2 compared to 2012 declines in heavier more fuelefficient coal shipments drove the variances in grosstonmiles and the fuel consumption rate 

purchased services and materials – expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors and other service providers including equipment maintenance and contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services materials used to maintain the railroad’s lines structures and equipment costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other railroads transportation and lodging for train crew employees trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers leased automobile maintenance expenses and tools and supplies expenses for purchased services increased 8 compared to 2013 primarily due to volume 

  

related expenses incurred by our logistics subsidiaries for external transportation and increased crew transportation and lodging due to volumes and a slower network in addition higher consulting fees and higher contract expenses including equipment maintenance increased costs compared to 2013 locomotive and freight car material expenses increased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to additional volumes including the impact of activating stored equipment to address operational issues caused by demand and a slower network 

expenses for purchased services increased 10 in 2013 compared to 2012 due to logistics management fees an increase in locomotive overhauls and repairs on jointly owned property 

depreciation – the majority of depreciation relates to road property including rail ties ballast and other track material depreciation was up 7 compared to 2013 a higher depreciable asset base reflecting higher ongoing capital spending drove the increase 

depreciation was up 1 in 2013 compared to 2012 recent depreciation studies allowed us to use longer estimated service lives for certain equipment which partially offset the impact of a higher depreciable asset base resulting from larger capital spending in recent years 

equipment and other rents – equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies freight car intermodal and locomotive leases and office and other rent expenses higher intermodal volumes and longer cycle times increased shortterm freight car rental expense in 2014 compared to 2013 lower equipment leases essentially offset the higher freight car rental expense as we exercised purchase options on some of our leased equipment 

additional container costs resulting from the logistics management arrangement and increased automotive shipments partially offset by lower cycle times drove a 51 million increase in our shortterm freight car rental expense in 2013 versus 2012 conversely lower locomotive and freight car lease expenses partially offset the higher freight car rental expense 

other – other expenses include state and local taxes freight equipment and property damage utilities insurance personal injury environmental employee travel telephone and cellular computer software bad debt and other general expenses higher property taxes personal injury expense and utilities costs partially offset by lower environmental expense and costs associated with damaged freight drove the increase in other costs in 2014 compared to 2013 

higher property taxes and costs associated with damaged freight and property increased other costs in 2013 compared to 2012 continued improvement in our safety performance and lower estimated liability for personal injury which reduced our personal injury expense yearoveryear partially offset increases in other costs 

nonoperating items 

 

 other income – other income increased in 2014 versus 2013 due to higher gains from real estate sales and a sale of a permanent easement these gains were partially offset by higher environmental costs on nonoperating property in 2014 and lower lease income due to the 17 million settlement of a land lease contract in 2013 

other income increased in 2013 versus 2012 due to higher gains from real estate sales and increased lease income including the favorable impact from the 17 million settlement of a land lease contract these increases were partially offset by interest received from a tax refund in 2012 

  

interest expense – interest expense increased in 2014 versus 2013 due to an increased weightedaverage debt level of 108 billion in 2014 from 96 billion in 2013 which more than offset the impact of the lower effective interest rate of 53 in 2014 versus 57 in 2013 

interest expense decreased in 2013 versus 2012 due to a lower effective interest rate of 57 in 2013 versus 60 in 2012 the increase in the weightedaverage debt level to 96 billion in 2013 from 91 billion in 2012 partially offset the impact of the lower effective interest rate 

income taxes – higher pretax income increased income taxes in 2014 compared to 2013 our effective tax rate for 2014 was 379 compared to 377 in 2013 

higher pretax income increased income taxes in 2013 compared to 2012 our effective tax rate for 2013 was 377 compared to 376 in 2012 

other operatingperformance and financial statistics 

we report a number of key performance measures weekly to the association of american railroads aar we provide this data on our website at wwwupcominvestoraarstbreportsindexhtm 

operatingperformance statistics 

railroad performance measures are included in the table below 

 

 average train speed – average train speed is calculated by dividing train miles by hours operated on our main lines between terminals average train speed as reported to the association of american railroads decreased 8 in 2014 versus 2013 the decline was driven by a 7 volume increase a major infrastructure project in fort worth texas and inclement weather including flooding in the midwest in the second quarter and severe weather conditions in the first quarter that impacted all major us and canadian railroads 

average train speed decreased 2 in 2013 versus 2012 the decline was driven by severe weather conditions and shifts of traffic to sections of our network with higher utilization 

average terminal dwell time – average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our terminals lower average terminal dwell time improves asset utilization and service average terminal dwell time increased 12 in 2014 compared to 2013 caused by higher volumes and inclement weather 

average terminal dwell time increased 3 in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to growth of manifest traffic which requires more time in terminals for switching cars and building trains 

gross and revenue tonmiles – gross tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled revenue tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles gross tonmiles revenue tonmiles and carloadings all increased 7 in 2014 compared to 2013 

gross tonmiles and revenue tonmiles declined 1 in 2013 compared to 2012 and carloads remained relatively flat driven by declines in coal and agricultural products offset by growth in chemical autos and industrial products changes in commodity mix drove the yearoveryear variances between gross tonmiles revenue tonmiles and carloads 

  

operating ratio – operating ratio is our operating expenses reflected as a percentage of operating revenue our operating ratio improved 26 points to a new record low of 635 in 2014 versus 2013 core pricing business demand and productivity more than offset the incremental operating costs associated with volume a slower network weather and inflation 

our operating ratio improved 17 points to a then record low of 661 in 2013 versus 2012 core pricing and productivity gains more than offset the impact of inflation 

employees – employee levels increased 2 in 2014 versus 2013 a decrease in our capital workforce due to improved productivity and project mix partially offset the larger train and engine workforce required for higher volume levels and a slower network we successfully managed the growth of our fulltime equivalent train and engine force levels at a rate less than our volume growth in 2014 compared to 2013 

employee levels increased 1 in 2013 versus 2012 shifts in our traffic mix which required more resources largely concentrated in the southern region work related to higher capital investment in positive train control and more individuals in the training pipeline contributed to the higher employee levels 

return on average common shareholders’ equity 

 

 return on invested capital as adjusted roic 

 

 roic is considered a nongaap financial measure by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe this measure is important in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our longterm capital investments in addition we currently use roic as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of equity compensation for our executives roic should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for other information provided in accordance with gaap the most comparable gaap measure is return on average common shareholders’ equity the tables above provide reconciliations from return on average common shareholders’ equity to roic our 2014 roic improved 15 points compared to 2013 primarily as a result of higher earnings 

  

debt to capital 

 

 adjusted debt to capital is a nongaap financial measure under sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the total amount of leverage in our capital structure including offbalance sheet lease obligations which we generally incur in connection with financing the acquisition of locomotives and freight cars and certain facilities operating leases were discounted using 53 and 57 at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively the discount rate reflects our effective interest rate we monitor the ratio of adjusted debt to capital as we manage our capital structure to balance costeffective and efficient access to the capital markets with our overall cost of capital adjusted debt to capital should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for debt to capital the tables above provide reconciliations from debt to capital to adjusted debt to capital our december 31 2014 debt to capital ratios increased as a result of a 19 billion increase in debt from december 31 2013 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2014 our principal sources of liquidity included cash cash equivalents our receivables securitization facility and our revolving credit facility as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets we had 17 billion of committed credit available under our credit facility with no borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2014 we did not make any borrowings under this facility during 2014 the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the 650 million capacity receivables securitization facility was 400 million as of december 31 2014 and is included in our consolidated statements of financial position as debt due after one year our access to this receivables securitization facility may be reduced or restricted if our bond ratings fall to certain levels below investment grade if our bond rating were to deteriorate it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financings is dependent on market conditions deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability we expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity through any or all of the following sources or activities i increasing the size or utilization of our receivables securitization ii issuing commercial paper iii entering into bank loans outside of our revolving credit facility or iv issuing bonds or other debt securities to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets the company’s 17 billion revolving credit facility is intended to support the issuance of commercial paper by upc and also serves as an emergency source of liquidity the company currently does not intend to make any borrowings under this facility 

at december 31 2014 and 2013 we had a modest working capital surplus this reflects a strong cash position that provides enhanced liquidity in an uncertain economic environment in addition we believe 

  

we have adequate access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

 

 operating activities 

higher net income in 2014 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2013 despite higher income tax payments 2014 income tax payments were higher than 2013 primarily due to higher income but also because we paid taxes previously deferred by bonus depreciation discussed below 

higher net income in 2013 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2012 in addition we made payments in 2012 for past wages as a result of national labor negotiations which reduced cash provided by operating activities in 2012 lower tax benefits from bonus depreciation as discussed below partially offset the increases 

federal tax law provided for 100 bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2011 and 50 bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 20122013 as a result the company deferred a substantial portion of its 20112013 income tax expense contributing to the positive operating cash flow in those years congress extended 50 bonus depreciation for 2014 but this extension occurred in december and did not have a significant benefit on our income tax payments during 2014 

investing activities 

higher capital investments including the early buyout of the longterm operating lease of our headquarters building for approximately 261 million drove the increase in cash used in investing activities compared to 2013 significant investments also were made for new locomotives freight cars and containers and capacity and commercial facility projects capital investments in 2014 also included 99 million for the early buyout of locomotives and freight cars under longterm operating leases which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions 

lower capital investments in locomotives and freight cars in 2013 drove the decrease in cash used in investing activities compared to 2012 included in capital investments in 2012 was 75 million for the early buyout of 165 locomotives under longterm operating and capital leases during the first quarter of 2012 which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions 

  

the following tables detail cash capital investments and track statistics for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 

 

  

  

  

 capital plan – in 2015 we expect our capital plan to be approximately 43 billion which may be revised if business conditions or the regulatory environment affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments while asset replacements will fluctuate as part of our renewal strategy we expect to use 55 to 60 of our capital investments to renew and improve existing capital assets our major investment categories include renewing track infrastructure and upgrading our fleet of locomotives freight cars and domestic intermodal containers in 2015 we plan to acquire 218 locomotives and increase freight car and container acquisitions additionally we will continue increasing our network and terminal capacity especially in the southern region while balancing terminal capacity with mainline capacity in 2015 we also plan to begin constructing a major classification yard at hearne texas and continue developing several intermodal automotive and chemicals facilities significant investments in technology improvements are planned including approximately 450 million for ptc 

we expect to fund our 2015 cash capital plan by using some or all of the following cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and cash on hand our annual capital plan is a critical component of our longterm strategic plan we expect our plan will enhance the longterm value of the company for our shareholders by providing sufficient resources to i replace and improve our existing track infrastructure to provide safe and fluid operations ii increase network efficiency by adding or improving facilities and track and iii make investments that meet customer demand and take advantage of opportunities for longterm growth 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities remained flat in 2014 versus 2013 increases for the repurchase of shares under our common stock repurchase program and higher dividend payments in 2014 of 16 billion compared to 13 billion in 2013 were offset by higher debt issuances in 2014 

cash used in financing activities increased in 2013 versus 2012 driven by a 744 million increase for the repurchase of shares under our common stock repurchase program and higher dividend payments in 2013 of 13 billion compared to 11 billion in 2012 we increased our debt levels in 2013 which partially offset the increase in cash used in financing activities 

  

dividends – on february 5 2015 we increased the quarterly dividend to 055 per share payable on march 30 2015 to shareholders of record on february 27 2015 we expect to fund the increase in the quarterly dividend through cash generated from operations and cash on hand at december 31 2014 

credit facilities – during the second quarter of 2014 we replaced our 18 billion revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in may 2015 with a new 17 billion facility that expires in may 2019 the facility the facility is based on substantially similar terms as those in the previous credit facility on december 31 2014 we had 17 billion of credit available under the facility which is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper we did not draw on either facility at any time during 2014 commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investmentgrade borrowers the facility allows for borrowings at floating rates based on london interbank offered rates plus a spread depending upon credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt 

the facility requires that the corporation maintain a debttonetworth coverage ratio as a condition to making a borrowing at december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 and at all times during the year we were in compliance with this covenant the definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the debttonetworth coverage ratio includes among other things certain credit arrangements capital leases guarantees and unfunded and vested pension benefits under title iv of erisa at december 31 2014 the debttonetworth coverage ratio allowed us to carry up to 424 billion of debt as defined in the facility and we had 116 billion of debt as defined in the facility outstanding at that date under our current capital plans we expect to continue to satisfy the debttonetworth coverage ratio however many factors beyond our reasonable control could affect our ability to comply with this provision in the future the facility does not include any other financial restrictions credit rating triggers other than ratingdependent pricing or any other provision that could require us to post collateral the facility also includes a 125 million crossdefault provision and a changeofcontrol provision 

during 2014 we did not issue or repay any commercial paper and at december 31 2014 and 2013 we had no commercial paper outstanding our revolving credit facility supports our outstanding commercial paper balances and unless we change the terms of our commercial paper program our aggregate issuance of commercial paper will not exceed the amount of borrowings available under the facility 

see further discussion in this item 7 under receivables securitization facility for information regarding the company’s receivables securitization facility 

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

for each of the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 135 118 and 104 respectively the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis earnings represent income from continuing operations less equity earnings net of distributions plus fixed charges and income taxes fixed charges represent interest charges amortization of debt discount and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges see exhibit 12 to this report for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

common shareholders’ equity 

dividend restrictions – our revolving credit facility includes a debttonet worth covenant discussed in the credit facilities section above that under certain circumstances restricts the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders the amount of retained earnings available for dividends was 154 billion and 163 billion at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

  

share repurchase program 

effective january 1 2014 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 120 million shares of our common stock by december 31 2017 replacing our previous repurchase program as of december 31 2014 we repurchased a total of 126 billion of our common stock since the commencement of our repurchase programs in 2007 the table below represents shares repurchased in 2013 under our previous repurchase program and shares repurchased in 2014 under the new program 

 

 management’s assessments of market conditions and other pertinent facts guide the timing and volume of all repurchases we expect to fund any share repurchases under this program through cash generated from operations the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties debt issuances and cash on hand repurchased shares are recorded in treasury stock at cost which includes any applicable commissions and fees 

from january 1 2015 through february 6 2015 we repurchased 28 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately 327 million 

shelf registration statement and significant new borrowings – under our current shelf registration we may issue from time to time any combination of debt securities preferred stock common stock or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings we have no immediate plans to issue equity securities however we will continue to explore opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under our shelf registration and therefore we may issue additional debt securities at any time 

during 2014 we issued the following unsecured fixedrate debt securities under our current shelf registration 

 

 we used the net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes including the repurchase of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program these debt securities include changeofcontrol provisions at december 31 2014 we had remaining authority to issue up to 115 billion of debt securities under our shelf registration 

subsequent event – in 2015 we issued the following unsecured fixedrate debt securities under our current shelf registration 

 

   

proceeds from this offering are for general corporate purposes including the repurchase of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program these debt securities include changeofcontrol provisions this offering exhausted our current authority to issue debt securities under our existing shelf registration 

on february 5 2015 the board of directors approved proceeding with a new shelf registration statement and authorized the issuance of up to 40 billion of debt securities 

equipment trust – on may 20 2014 uprr consummated a passthrough pt financing whereby a pt trust was created which issued 500 million of pt trust certificates with a stated interest rate of 3227 the pt trust certificates will mature on may 14 2026 the proceeds from the issuance of the pt trust certificates net of 3 million in transaction fees were used to purchase equipment trust certificates to be issued by uprr to finance the acquisition of 245 locomotives the equipment trust certificates are secured by a lien on the locomotives 

debt exchange – on august 21 2013 we exchanged 1170 million of various outstanding notes and debentures due between 2016 and 2040 the existing notes for 439 million of 3646 notes the new 2024 notes due february 15 2024 and 700 million of 4821 notes the new 2044 notes due february 1 2044 plus cash consideration of approximately 280 million in addition to 8 million for accrued and unpaid interest on the existing notes in accordance with asc 4705040 debtmodifications and extinguishmentsderecognition this transaction was accounted for as a debt exchange as the exchanged debt instruments are not considered to be substantially different the cash consideration was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of debt and the balance of the unamortized discount and issue costs from the existing notes is being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the terms of the new 2024 notes and the new 2044 notes no gain or loss was recognized as a result of the exchange costs related to the debt exchange that were payable to parties other than the debt holders totaled approximately 9 million and were included in interest expense during the three months ended september 30 2013 

the following table lists the outstanding notes and debentures that were exchanged 

 

 debt redemption – on may 14 2013 we redeemed all 40 million of our outstanding 565 port of corpus christi authority revenue refunding bonds due december 1 2022 the redemption resulted in an early extinguishment charge of 1 million in the second quarter of 2013 

receivables securitization facility – on july 29 2014 we completed the renewal of our receivables securitization facility the new 650 million 3year facility replaces the prior 600 million 364day facility under the facility the railroad sells most of its eligible thirdparty receivables to union pacific receivables inc upri a whollyowned bankruptcyremote subsidiary that may subsequently transfer without recourse an undivided interest in accounts receivable to investors the investors have no 

  

recourse to the railroad’s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims creditors of the railroad do not have recourse to the assets of upri 

the amount outstanding under the facility was 400 million and 0 at december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 respectively the facility was supported by 12 billion and 11 billion of accounts receivable as collateral at december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 respectively which as a retained interest is included in accounts receivable net in our consolidated statements of financial position 

the outstanding amount the railroad is allowed to maintain under the facility with a maximum of 650 million may fluctuate based on the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by business volumes and credit risks including receivables payment quality measures such as default and dilution ratios if default or dilution ratios increase one percent the allowable outstanding amount under the facility would not materially change 

the costs of the receivables securitization facility include interest which will vary based on prevailing benchmark and commercial paper rates program fees paid to participating banks commercial paper issuing costs and fees of participating banks for unused commitment availability the costs of the receivables securitization facility are included in interest expense and were 4 million 5 million and 3 million for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and as referenced in the tables below we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments including material sources of offbalance sheet and structured finance arrangements other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets as described in item 1a of part ii of this report there is no known trend demand commitment event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition our commercial obligations financings and commitments are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations particularly within the transportation industry 

the following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of december 31 2014 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

guarantees – at december 31 2014 and 2013 we were contingently liable for 82 million and 299 million in guarantees we have recorded liabilities of 03 million and 1 million for the fair value of these obligations as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business and they include guaranteed obligations related to our equipment financings and affiliated operations the final guarantee expires in 2022 we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

other matters 

labor agreements – approximately 85 of our 47201 fulltimeequivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions on january 1 2015 current labor agreements became subject to modification and we began the current round of negotiations with the unions existing agreements remain in effect until new agreements are reached or the railway labor act’s procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential emergency boards and congressional intervention are exhausted contract negotiations historically continue for an extended period of time and we rarely experience work stoppages while negotiations are pending 

inflation – long periods of inflation significantly increase asset replacement costs for capitalintensive companies as a result assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels depreciation charges on an inflationadjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 

derivative financial instruments – we may use derivative financial instruments in limited instances to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and fuel prices we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged both at inception and throughout the hedged period we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items at inception as well as our riskmanagement objectives strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness changes in the fair market value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are charged to earnings we may use swaps collars futures andor forward contracts to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in interest rates and fuel prices however the use of these derivative financial instruments may limit future benefits from favorable price movements 

market and credit risk – we address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item we manage credit risk related to derivative financial instruments which is minimal by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements at december 31 2014 and 2013 we were not required to provide collateral nor had we received collateral relating to our hedging activities 

  

determination of fair value – we determine the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or the present value of expected future cash flows 

sensitivity analyses – the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 

at december 31 2014 we had variablerate debt representing approximately 53 of our total debt if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2015 than our december 31 2014 variable rate which was approximately 09 our interest expense would increase by approximately 4 million this amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balances of our variablerate debt at december 31 2014 

market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2014 and amounts to an increase of approximately 13 billion to the fair value of our debt at december 31 2014 we estimated the fair values of our fixedrate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 

interest rate fair value hedges – we manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period we generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings we employ derivatives primarily swaps as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix in addition we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixedrate debt securities 

swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt’s fair value attributable to the changes in interest rates we account for swaps as fair value hedges using the shortcut method as allowed by the derivatives and hedging topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb asc 815 therefore we do not record any ineffectiveness within our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2014 and 2013 we had no interest rate fair value hedges outstanding 

interest rate cash flow hedges – we report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affects earnings at december 31 2014 and 2013 we had reductions of 0 and 1 million respectively recorded as an accumulated other comprehensive loss as of december 31 2014 and 2013 we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding 

accounting pronouncements – in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201409 asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  asu 201409 supersedes the revenue recognition guidance in topic 605 revenue recognition the core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in the exchange for those goods or services this standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 asu 201409 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

asserted and unasserted claims – various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries we cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity however to the extent possible where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated we have recorded a liability we do not expect that any known lawsuits claims environmental costs commitments contingent liabilities or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters 

indemnities – our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements including certain tax indemnifications can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount depending on the 

  

nature of the transactions and the agreements due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions 

climate change – although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item 1a of this report we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact however we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment including investments in new technologies using training programs to reduce fuel consumption and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 2 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 these critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 

personal injury – the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability including unasserted claims the federal employers’ liability act fela governs compensation for workrelated accidents under fela damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or outofcourt settlements we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 

our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments approximately 93 of the recorded liability is related to asserted claims and approximately 7 is related to unasserted claims at december 31 2014 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 335 million to 368 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation 

our personal injury liability activity was as follows 

 

   

our personal injury claims activity was as follows 

 

 in conjunction with the liability update performed in 2014 we also reassessed our estimated insurance recoveries we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2014 and 2013 

asbestos – we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other parties allege exposure to asbestos we assess our potential liability using a statistical analysis of resolution costs for asbestosrelated claims this liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing costs the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions 

 

    our liability for asbestosrelated claims is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments approximately 21 of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 79 related to unasserted claims at december 31 2014 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestosrelated claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 126 million to 135 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other 

our asbestosrelated liability activity was as follows 

 

 in conjunction with the liability update performed in 2014 we also reassessed our estimated insurance recoveries we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2014 and 2013 the amounts recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts however future events such as the number of new claims filed each year average settlement costs and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts estimates also may vary in the future if 

  

strategies activities and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change federal and state laws governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimants and there are material changes with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants 

environmental costs – we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations we have identified 270 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements this includes 29 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government 16 of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 

when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in our business we perform with assistance of our consultants environmental assessments on the property we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated our environmental liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments 

our environmental liability activity was as follows 

 

 our environmental site activity was as follows 

 

 the environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties cost estimates are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and existing technology laws and regulations the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties sitespecific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal state and local laws governing environmental remediation current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

property and depreciation – our railroad operations are highly capital intensive and our large base of homogeneous networktype assets turns over on a continuous basis each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated service lives which are measured in years except for rail in highdensity traffic corridors ie all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment yard and switching tracks and electronic yards for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics use and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes 

  

and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources not as singular items we currently have more than 60 depreciable asset classes and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology asset strategies or other factors 

we determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property by means of depreciation studies we perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets ie rail and other track material ties and ballast and other road property our depreciation studies take into account the following factors 

 

    for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track it has been our experience that the lives of rail in highdensity traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage ie the amount of weight carried over the rail the service lives also vary based on rail weight rail condition eg new or secondhand and rail type eg straight or curve our depreciation studies for rail in highdensity traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross tonmiles carried over the rail ie the weight of loaded and empty freight cars locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile rail in highdensity traffic corridors accounts for approximately 70 percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material based on the number of gross tonmiles carried over our rail in high density traffic corridors during 2014 the estimated service lives of the majority of this rail ranged from approximately 18 years to approximately 35 years for all other depreciable assets we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively 

estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to changes in physical use technology asset strategies and other factors that will have an impact on the retirement profiles of our assets we are not aware of any specific factors that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service lives of our assets actual use and retirement of our assets may vary from our current estimates which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future periods 

changes in estimated useful lives of our assets due to the results of our depreciation studies could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately 63 million if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were decreased by one year annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately 68 million our recent depreciation studies have resulted in lower depreciation rates for some asset classes the lower rates combined with a projected higher depreciable asset base will increase total depreciation expense by approximately 4 to 6 in 2015 versus 2014 

under group depreciation the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using i inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ii the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate in addition we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies any deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets 

  

for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions i it is unusual ii it is material in amount and iii it varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies during the last three fiscal years no gains or losses were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad properties a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations 

income taxes – we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns these expected future tax consequences are measured based on current tax law the effects of future tax legislation are not anticipated future tax legislation such as a change in the corporate tax rate could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity for example a 1 increase in future income tax rates would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately 380 million 

when appropriate we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reflect that these tax assets may not be realized in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized based on management’s judgments using available evidence for purposes of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize a deferred tax asset in 2014 and 2013 there were no valuation allowances 

we recognize tax benefits that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement a liability for “unrecognized tax benefits” is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards 

pension and other postretirement benefits – we use an actuarial analysis to measure the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and medical and life insurance benefits opeb to eligible employees in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make several assumptions the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets for opeb the critical assumptions are the discount rate and health care cost trend rate 

we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually and selected assumptions are based on the following factors 

 

   the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit for 2014 and the estimated impact on 2014 net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit relative to a change in those assumptions 

 

   

 the following table presents the net periodic pension and opeb cost for the years ended december 31 

 

 our net periodic pension cost is expected to increase to approximately 105 million in 2015 from 69 million in 2014 our net periodic opeb expense is expected to increase to approximately 18 million in 2015 from 15 million in 2014 the increases are driven by the implementation of new mortality tables issued by the society of actuaries in october 2014 along with a decrease in the pension discount rate to 394 and a decrease in the opeb discount rate to 374

additionally the ceo and cfo determined that there were no changes to the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting 

  

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

the management of union pacific corporation and subsidiary companies the corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f the corporation’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the corporation’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 

all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

the corporation’s management assessed the effectiveness of the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 in making this assessment it used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control – integrated framework 2013 based on our assessment management believes that as of december 31 2014 the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended december 31 2014 of the corporation and our report dated february 6 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule

coal – shipments of coal and petroleum coke accounted for 19 of our freight revenue in 2013 the railroad’s network supports the transportation of coal and petroleum coke to independent and regulated power companies and industrial facilities throughout the us through interchange gateways and ports up’s reach extends to eastern us utilities mexico europe and asia water terminals allow the railroad to move western us coal east via the mississippi and ohio rivers as well as the great lakes export coal moves through west coast ports to asia and through the mississippi river and houston to europe coal traffic originating in the southern powder river basin sprb area of wyoming is the largest segment of up’s coal business 

industrial products – our extensive network facilitates the movement of numerous commodities between thousands of origin and destination points throughout north america the industrial products group consists of several categories including construction products minerals consumer goods metals 

  

lumber paper and other miscellaneous products in 2013 this group generated 18 of union pacific’s total freight revenue commercial residential and governmental infrastructure investments drive shipments of steel aggregates cement components cement and wood products oil and gas drilling generates demand for raw steel finished pipe frac sand stone and drilling fluid commodities industrial and light manufacturing plants receive steel nonferrous materials minerals and other raw materials paper and packaging commodities as well as appliances move to major metropolitan areas for consumers lumber shipments originate primarily in the pacific northwest and western canada and move throughout the us for use in new home construction and repair and remodeling 

intermodal – our intermodal business includes two segments international and domestic international business consists of import and export container traffic that mainly passes through west coast ports served by up’s extensive terminal network domestic business includes container and trailer traffic picked up and delivered within north america for intermodal marketing companies primarily shipper agents and logistics companies as well as truckload carriers lessthantruckload and package carriers with timesensitive business requirements are also an important part of domestic shipments together international and domestic business generated 20 of up’s 2013 freight revenue 

seasonality – some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons reflecting either or both the nature of the commodity such as certain agricultural and food products that have specific growing and harvesting seasons and the demand cycle for the commodity such as intermodal traffic which generally has a peak shipping season during the third quarter to meet holidayrelated demand for consumer goods during the fourth quarter the peak shipping seasons for these commodities can vary considerably from year to year depending upon various factors including the strength of domestic and international economies and currencies and the strength of harvests and market prices for agricultural products in response to an annual request delivered by the surface transportation board stb of the us department of transportation dot to all of the class i railroads operating in the us we issue a publicly available letter during the third quarter detailing our plans for handling traffic during the third and fourth quarters and providing other information requested by the stb 

working capital – at december 31 2013 and 2012 we had a modest working capital surplus which provides enhanced liquidity in addition we believe we have adequate access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

competition – we are subject to competition from other railroads motor carriers ship and barge operators and pipelines our main railroad competitor is burlington northern santa fe llc its primary subsidiary bnsf railway company bnsf operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors in addition we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers motor carrier competition exists for five of our six commodity groups excluding most coal shipments because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and gulf coast waterways barges can be particularly competitive especially for grain and bulk commodities in certain areas where we operate in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times quality and reliability of service from motor carriers and other railroads motor carriers in particular can have an advantage over railroads with respect to transit times and timeliness of service however railroads are much more fuel efficient than trucks which reduces the impact of transporting goods on the environment and public infrastructure and railroads operating in the us including us have been making efforts to convert certain traffic from motor carriers to railroad service additionally we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any of the following could also affect the competitiveness of our transportation services for some or all of our commodities i improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation ii legislation that eliminates or significantly reduces the size or weight limitations applied to motor carriers or iii legislation or regulatory changes that impose operating restrictions on railroads or that adversely affect the profitability of some or all railroad traffic for more information regarding risks we face from competition see the risk factors in item 1a of this report 

key suppliers – we depend on two key domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives due to the capital intensive nature of the locomotive manufacturing business and sophistication of this equipment potential new suppliers face high barriers of entry into this industry therefore if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives for any reason including insolvency or bankruptcy we could experience a significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations additionally for a high percentage of our rail purchases we utilize two steel 

  

producers one domestic and one international that meet our specifications rail is critical for both maintenance of our network and replacement and improvement or expansion of our network and facilities rail manufacturing also has high barriers of entry and if one of those suppliers discontinues operations for any reason including insolvency or bankruptcy we could experience cost increases and difficulty obtaining rail 

employees – approximately 86 of our 46445 fulltimeequivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions in 2012 we concluded the most recent round of negotiations which began in 2010 with the ratification of new agreements by several unions all of the unions executed similar multiyear agreements that provide for higher employee cost sharing of employee health and welfare benefits and higher wages the current agreements will remain in effect until renegotiated under provisions of the railway labor act the next round of negotiations will begin in early 2015 

railroad security – our security efforts rely upon a wide variety of measures including employee training cooperation with our customers training of emergency responders and partnerships with numerous federal state and local government agencies while federal law requires us to protect the confidentiality of our security plans designed to safeguard against terrorism and other security incidents the following provides a general overview of our security initiatives 

uprr security measures – we maintain a comprehensive security plan designed to both deter and to respond to any potential or actual threats as they arise the plan includes four levels of alert status each with its own set of countermeasures we employ our own police force consisting of more than 200 commissioned and highlytrained officers our employees also undergo recurrent security and preparedness training as well as federallymandated hazardous materials and security training we regularly review the sufficiency of our employee training programs we maintain the capability to move critical operations to backup facilities in different locations 

we have an emergency response management center which operates 24 hours a day the center receives reports of emergencies dangerous or potentially dangerous conditions and other safety and security issues from our employees the public and law enforcement and other government officials in cooperation with government officials we monitor both threats and public events and as necessary we may alter rail traffic flow at times of concern to minimize risk to communities and our operations we comply with the hazardous materials routing rules and other requirements imposed by federal law we also design our operating plan to expedite the movement of hazardous material shipments to minimize the time rail cars remain idle at yards and terminals located in or near major population centers additionally in compliance with transportation security agency regulations we deployed information systems and instructed employees in tracking and documenting the handoff of rail security sensitive material with customers and interchange partners 

we also have established a number of our own innovative safety and securityoriented initiatives ranging from various investments in technology to the officer on the train program which provides local law enforcement officers with the opportunity to ride with train crews to enhance their understanding of railroad operations and risks our staff of information security professionals continually assesses cyber security risks and implements mitigation programs that evolve with the changing technology threat environment to date we have not experienced any material disruption of our operations due to a cyber threat or attack directed at us 

cooperation with federal state and local government agencies – we work closely on physical and cyber security initiatives with government agencies that include the dot and the department of homeland security dhs as well as local police departments fire departments and other first responders in conjunction with dot dhs and other railroads we sponsor operation respond which provides first responders with secure links to electronic railroad resources including mapping systems shipment records and other essential information required by emergency personnel to respond to accidents and other situations we also participate in the national joint terrorism task force a multiagency effort established by the us department of justice and the federal bureau of investigation to combat and prevent terrorism 

we work with the coast guard us customs and border protection cbp and the military transport management command which monitor shipments entering the uprr rail network at us border crossings and ports we were the first railroad in the us to be named a partner in cbp’s customs 

  

trade partnership against terrorism a partnership designed to develop enhance and maintain effective security processes throughout the global supply chain 

cooperation with customers and trade associations – along with other railroads we work with the american chemistry council to train approximately 200000 emergency responders annually we work with many of our chemical shippers to establish plant security plans and we continue to take steps to more closely monitor and track hazardous materials shipments in cooperation with the federal railroad administration fra and other interested groups we are also working to develop additional improvements to tank car design that will further limit the risk of releases of hazardous materials 

governmental and environmental regulation 

governmental regulation – our operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local regulations generally applicable to all businesses see also the discussion of certain regulatory proceedings in legal proceedings item 3 

the operations of the railroad are also subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the stb the stb has jurisdiction over rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic common carrier service of regulated traffic freight car compensation transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines and acquisition of control of rail common carriers in 2013 the stb continued its efforts to explore whether to expand rail regulation the stb has requested parties to submit studies that describe and quantify the potential impact of expanded reciprocal switching or trackage rights arrangements on railroads for the past several legislative sessions proposed bills have been introduced in congress that aim to alter the regulatory structure of the railroad industry we will continue to monitor any legislative activity involving rail and transportation regulation and respond accordingly 

the operations of the railroad also are subject to the regulations of the fra and other federal and state agencies on january 12 2010 the fra issued initial rules governing installation of positive train control ptc by the end of 2015 the final regulation is still forthcoming although still under development ptc is a collision avoidance technology intended to override engineer controlled locomotives and stop a train before an accident following the issuance of the initial rules the fra acknowledged that projected costs will exceed projected benefits by a ratio of at least 22 to one and we estimate that our costs will be higher than those assumed by the fra in august 2012 the fra provided congress with a status report regarding implementation of ptc this report indicated that the rail industry will likely achieve only partial deployment of ptc by the current deadline due to significant technical and other issues through 2013 we have invested over 12 billion in the development of ptc 

dot the occupational safety and health administration pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration and dhs along with other federal agencies have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety movement of hazardous materials and hazardous waste emissions requirements and equipment standards the rail safety improvement act of 2008 among other things revised hours of service rules for train and certain other railroad employees mandated implementation of ptc imposed passenger service requirements addressed safety at rail crossings increased the number of safety related employees of the fra and increased fines that may be levied against railroads for safety violations additionally various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law 

environmental regulation – we are subject to extensive federal and state environmental statutes and regulations pertaining to public health and the environment the statutes and regulations are administered and monitored by the environmental protection agency epa and by various state environmental agencies the primary laws affecting our operations are the resource conservation and recovery act regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act regulating the cleanup of contaminated properties the clean air act regulating air emissions and the clean water act regulating waste water discharges

the information set forth in this item 1a should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this report including management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item 7 and financial statements and supplementary data item 8 

we must manage fluctuating demand for our services and network capacity – if there is significant demand for our services that exceeds the designed capacity of our network we may experience network difficulties including congestion and reduced velocity that could compromise the level of service we provide to our customers this level of demand may also compound the impact of weather and weatherrelated events on our operations and velocity although we continue to improve our transportation plan add capacity improve operations at our yards and other facilities and improve our ability to address surges in demand for any reason with adequate resources we cannot be sure that these measures will fully or adequately address any service shortcomings resulting from demand exceeding our planned capacity we may experience other operational or service difficulties related to network capacity dramatic and unplanned increases or decreases of demand for rail service with respect to one or more of our commodity groups or operating regions or other events that could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in the event that we experience significant reductions of demand for rail services with respect to one or more of our commodity groups we may experience increased costs associated with resizing our operations including higher unit operating costs and costs for the storage of locomotives rail cars and other equipment workforce adjustments and other related activities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we transport hazardous materials – we transport certain hazardous materials and other materials including crude oil and toxic inhalation hazard tih materials such as chlorine that pose certain risks in the event of a release or combustion additionally us laws impose common carrier obligations on railroads that require us to transport certain hazardous materials regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss a rail accident or other incident or accident on our network at our facilities or at the facilities of our customers involving the release or combustion of hazardous materials could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury property damage and environmental penalties and remediation in excess of our insurance coverage for these risks which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to significant governmental regulation – we are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal state and local authorities covering a variety of health safety labor environmental economic as discussed below and other matters many laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses permits and other authorizations and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us governments or regulators may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate without providing us any recourse to address any adverse effects on our business including without limitation regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution business relationships with other railroads calculation of our cost of capital or other inputs relevant to computing our revenue adequacy the prices we charge and costs and expenses significant legislative activity in congress or regulatory activity by the stb could expand regulation of railroad operations and prices for rail services which could reduce capital spending on our rail network facilities and equipment and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity as part of the rail safety improvement act of 2008 rail carriers must currently implement ptc by the end of 2015 which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make other capital investments rail carriers likely will not meet the current mandatory deadline for ptc implementation due to various factors additionally one or more consolidations of class i railroads could also lead to increased regulation of the rail industry 

we may be affected by general economic conditions – prolonged severe adverse domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of financial and credit markets may affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry and may have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity and our results of operations and financial condition 

we face competition from other railroads and other transportation providers – we face competition from other railroads motor carriers ships barges and pipelines in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service while we must build or 

  

acquire and maintain our rail system trucks barges and maritime operators are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation or legislation that eliminates or significantly reduces the burden of the size or weight limitations currently applicable to motor carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect the competitive environment in which we operate 

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures – as a railroad with a vast network we are exposed to severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods mudslides or landslides extreme temperatures and significant precipitation that may cause business interruptions including line outages on our rail network that can adversely affect our entire rail network and result in increased costs increased liabilities and decreased revenue which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations – we rely on information technology in all aspects of our business if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if we are unable to develop or implement new technology such as ptc or the latest version of our transportation control systems we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally if a cyber attack or other event causes significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment we could suffer a significant service interruption safety failure security breach or other operational difficulties which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures – as a railroad with operations in densely populated urban areas and other cities and a vast rail network we are exposed to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage environmental liability and other matters any material changes to litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving any or all of property damage personal injury and environmental liability that exceed our insurance coverage for such risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to significant environmental laws and regulations – due to the nature of the railroad business our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waters handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and hazardous material or petroleum releases we generate and transport hazardous and nonhazardous waste in our operations and we did so in our former operations environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties leased properties and properties owned by third parties as well as to properties we currently own environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation we have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated or are strictly liable under these laws or regulations we currently have certain obligations at existing sites for investigation remediation and monitoring and we likely will have obligations at other sites in the future liabilities for these obligations affect our estimate based on our experience and as necessary the advice and assistance of our consultants however actual costs may vary from our estimates due to any or all of several factors including changes to environmental laws or interpretations of such laws technological changes affecting investigations and remediation the participation and financial viability of other parties responsible for any such liability and the corrective action or change to correction actions required to remediate any existing or future sites we could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we may be affected by climate change and market or regulatory responses to climate change – climate change including the impact of global warming could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gasses including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating costs restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that a use commodities that we carry 

  

to produce energy b use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry or c manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels including chemical producers farmers and food producers and automakers and other manufacturers significant cost increases government regulation or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns including for example the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers finally we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change any of these factors individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations as the majority of our employees belong to labor unions and labor agreements – the us class i railroads are party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in among other things strikes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts which could cause a significant disruption of our operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could compromise our service reliability or significantly increase our costs for health care wages and other benefits which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

the availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations – changes in demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to meet demand for rail service unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

rising or elevated fuel costs and our ability to mitigate these costs with fuel surcharges – fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses diesel fuel prices can be subject to dramatic fluctuations and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results although we currently are able to recover a significant amount of our fuel expenses from our customers through revenue from fuel surcharges we cannot be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elevated fuel costs through our fuel surcharges additionally future market conditions or legislative or regulatory activities could adversely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharges or adequately recover increased fuel costs through fuel surcharges international political and economic factors events and conditions affect fuel prices and supplies weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity a severe shortage of or disruption to domestic fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we utilize capital markets – due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements we utilize longterm debt instruments bank financing and commercial paper from timetotime and we pledge certain of our receivables significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets including the credit markets or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to and significantly increase the cost of commercial paper and other financing sources including bank credit facilities and the issuance of longterm debt including corporate bonds a significant deterioration of our financial condition could result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade which could restrict or at certain credit levels below investment grade may prohibit us from utilizing our current receivables securitization facility this may also limit our access to external sources of capital and significantly increase the costs of short and longterm debt financing 

a significant portion of our revenue involves transportation of commodities to and from international markets – although revenues from our operations are attributable to transportation services provided in the united states a significant portion of our revenues involves the transportation of commodities to and 

  

from international markets including mexico and southeast asia by various carriers and at times various modes of transportation significant and sustained interruptions of trade with mexico or countries in southeast asia including china could adversely affect customers and other entities that directly or indirectly purchase or rely on rail transportation services in the us as part of their operations and any such interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity any one or more of the following could cause a significant and sustained interruption of trade with mexico or countries in southeast asia a deterioration of security for international trade and businesses the adverse impact of new laws rules and regulations or the interpretation of laws rules and regulations by government entities courts or regulatory bodies including taxing authorities that affect our customers doing business in foreign countries any significant adverse economic developments such as extended periods of high inflation material disruptions in the banking sector or in the capital markets of these foreign countries and significant changes in the valuation of the currencies of these foreign countries that could materially affect the cost or value of imports or exports shifts in patterns of international trade that adversely affect import and export markets and a material reduction in foreign direct investment in these countries 

we are subject to legislative regulatory and legal developments involving taxes – taxes are a significant part of our expenses we are subject to us federal state and foreign income payroll property sales and use fuel and other types of taxes changes in tax rates enactment of new tax laws revisions of tax regulations and claims or litigation with taxing authorities could result in substantially higher taxes and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are dependent on certain key suppliers of locomotives and rail – due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry therefore if one of the domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives discontinues manufacturing locomotives for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience significant cost increases and reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary for our operations additionally for a high percentage of our rail purchases we utilize two steel producers one domestic and one international that meet our specifications rail is critical to our operations for rail replacement programs maintenance and for adding additional network capacity new rail and storage yards and expansions of existing facilities this industry similarly has high barriers to entry and if one of these suppliers discontinues operations for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience both significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail for maintenance and other projects 

we may be affected by acts of terrorism war or risk of war – our rail lines facilities and equipment including rail cars carrying hazardous materials could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks terrorist attacks or other similar events any government response thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in addition insurance premiums for some or all of our current coverages could increase dramatically or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future

environmental matters – certain of our properties are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment see discussion of environmental issues in business – governmental and environmental regulation item 1 and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies – environmental item 7 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation that occur in connection with our business we routinely assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest available information and when necessary we seek input from our thirdparty advisors when making these assessments consistent with sec rules and requirements we describe below material pending legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities other proceedings arising under federal state or local environmental laws and regulations including governmental proceedings involving potential fines penalties or other monetary sanctions in excess of 100000 and such other pending matters that we may determine to be appropriate 

environmental matters 

as previously reported in our annual report on form 10k for 2012 the illinois attorney general’s office notified uprr on january 14 2013 that it will seek a penalty against the railroad for environmental conditions caused by its predecessor at a former locomotive fueling facility in south pekin illinois this former cnw facility discontinued fueling operations in the early 1980s subsequent environmental investigation revealed evidence of fuel releases to soil and groundwater in january 2007 the state rejected uprr’s proposed compliance commitment agreement and responded with a notice of intent to pursue legal action uprr continued to perform remedial investigations under the supervision of the illinois epa in june 2012 the illinois epa approved uprr’s proposed remedial action plan for the contamination although no further action is required for the contamination the state is now seeking to recover a penalty the state offered to settle the matter prior to litigation for payment of a 240000 penalty uprr rejected that offer and the state sued uprr on october 26 2013 in the circuit court for the tenth judicial circuit tazewell county illinois uprr will vigorously defend against the allegations in the complaint although the complaint does not state an amount for the proposed penalty any penalty whether payable by settlement or following an unsuccessful defense of the claim may exceed 100000 

we received notices from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are or may be liable under federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the us including sites on the superfund national priorities list or state superfund lists we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings and suits because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs 

information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies – environmental item 7 

other matters 

antitrust litigation – as we reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2007 20 rail shippers many of whom are represented by the same law firms filed virtually identical antitrust lawsuits in various federal district courts against us and four other class i railroads in the us currently uprr and three other class i railroads are the named defendants in the lawsuit the original plaintiff filed the first of these claims in the us district court in new jersey on may 14 2007 the number of complaints reached a total of 30 these suits allege that the named railroads engaged in pricefixing by establishing common fuel surcharges for certain rail traffic 

in addition to suits filed by direct purchasers of rail transportation a few of the suits involved plaintiffs alleging that they are or were indirect purchasers of rail transportation and sought to represent a purported class of indirect purchasers of rail transportation that paid fuel surcharges these complaints added allegations under state antitrust and consumer protection laws on november 6 2007 the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation ordered that all of the rail fuel surcharge cases be transferred to judge paul friedman of the us district court in the district of columbia for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings following numerous hearings and rulings judge friedman dismissed the complaints of the indirect purchasers which the indirect purchasers appealed on april 16 2010 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia affirmed judge friedman’s ruling dismissing the indirect purchasers’ claims based on various state laws 

  

with respect to the direct purchasers’ complaint judge friedman conducted a twoday hearing on october 6 and 7 2010 on the class certification issue and the railroad defendants’ motion to exclude evidence of interline communications on april 7 2011 judge friedman issued an order deferring any decision on class certification until the supreme court issued its decision in the walmart employment discrimination case 

on june 21 2012 judge friedman issued his decision which certified a class of plaintiffs with eight named plaintiff representatives the decision included in the class all shippers that paid a ratebased fuel surcharge to any one of the defendant railroads for rateunregulated rail transportation from july 1 2003 through december 31 2008 this was a procedural ruling which did not affirm any of the claims asserted by the plaintiffs and does not affect the ability of the railroad defendants to disprove the allegations made by the plaintiffs on july 5 2012 the defendant railroads filed a petition with the us court of appeals for the district of columbia requesting that the court review the class certification ruling on august 28 2012 a panel of the circuit court of the district of columbia referred the petition to a merits panel of the court to address the issues in the petition and to address whether the district court properly granted class certification the circuit court heard oral arguments on may 3 2013 on august 9 2013 the circuit court vacated the class certification decision and remanded the case to the district court to reconsider the class certification decision in light of a recent supreme court case and incomplete consideration of errors in the expert report of the plaintiffs on october 31 2013 judge friedman approved a schedule agreed to by all parties for consideration of the class certification issue on remand the schedule which includes dates for briefs expert reports and depositions concludes in june 2014 the court has not set a date for hearing arguments on the class certification issue or any other aspect of this litigation 

as we reported in our current report on form 8k filed on june 10 2011 the railroad received a complaint filed in the us district court for the district of columbia on june 7 2011 by oxbow carbon  minerals llc and related entities oxbow the complaint named the railroad and one other us class i railroad as defendants and alleged that the named railroads engaged in pricefixing and monopolistic practices in connection with fuel surcharge programs and pricing of shipments of certain commodities including coal and petroleum coke the complaint sought injunctive relief and payment of damages of over 30 million and other unspecified damages including treble damages some of the allegations in the complaint were addressed in the existing fuel surcharge litigation referenced above the complaint also included additional unrelated allegations regarding alleged limitations on competition for shipments of oxbow’s commodities judge friedman who presides over the fuel surcharge matter described above also presides over this matter on february 26 2013 judge friedman granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss oxbow’s complaint for failure to state properly a claim under the antitrust laws however the dismissal was without prejudice to refile the complaint judge friedman approved a schedule that allowed oxbow to file a revised complaint which oxbow filed on may 1 2013 the amended complaint alleges that uprr and one other class i railroad violated sections 1 and 2 of the sherman antitrust act and that uprr also breached a tolling agreement between oxbow and uprr oxbow claims that it paid more than 50 million in wrongfully imposed fuel surcharges uprr and the other railroad filed separate motions to dismiss the oxbow revised complaint on july 1 2013 

we deny the allegations that our fuel surcharge programs violate the antitrust laws or any other laws we believe that these lawsuits are without merit and we will vigorously defend our actions therefore we currently believe that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on any of our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

 results of operations 

operating revenues 

 

 we generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our six commodity groups freight revenues vary with volume carloads and arc changes in price traffic mix and fuel surcharges drive arc we provide some of our customers with contractual incentives for meeting or exceeding specified cumulative volumes or shipping to and from specific locations which we record as reductions to freight revenues based on the actual or projected future shipments we recognize freight revenues as shipments move from origin to destination we allocate freight revenues between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them 

other revenues include revenues earned by our subsidiaries revenues from our commuter rail operations and accessorial revenues which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us or when we perform additional services such as switching or storage we recognize other revenues as we perform services or meet contractual obligations 

freight revenues from five of our six commodity groups increased during 2013 compared to 2012 revenue from agricultural products was down slightly compared to 2012 arc increased 5 driven by core pricing gains shifts in business mix and an automotive logistics management arrangement volume was essentially flat year over year as growth in automotives frac sand crude oil and domestic intermodal offset declines in coal international intermodal and grain shipments 

freight revenues from four of our six commodity groups increased during 2012 compared to 2011 revenues from coal and agricultural products declined during the year our franchise diversity allowed us to take advantage of growth from shalerelated markets crude oil frac sand and pipe and strong automotive manufacturing which offset volume declines from coal and agricultural products arc increased 7 driven by core pricing gains and higher fuel cost recoveries improved fuel recovery provisions and higher fuel prices including the lag effect of our programs surcharges trail fluctuations in fuel price by approximately two months combined to increase revenues from fuel surcharges 

our fuel surcharge programs generated freight revenues of 26 billion 26 billion and 22 billion in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively fuel surcharge in 2013 was essentially flat versus 2012 as lower fuel price offset improved fuel recovery provisions and the lag effect of our programs surcharges trail fluctuations in fuel price by approximately two months rising fuel prices and more shipments subject to fuel surcharges drove the increase from 2011 to 2012 

in 2013 other revenue increased from 2012 due primarily to miscellaneous contract revenue and higher revenues at our subsidiaries that broker intermodal and automotive services 

in 2012 other revenues increased from 2011 due primarily to higher revenues at our subsidiaries that broker intermodal and automotive services assessorial revenues also increased in 2012 due to container revenue related to an increase in intermodal shipments 

  

the following tables summarize the yearoveryear changes in freight revenues revenue carloads and arc by commodity type 

 

  

  

   

  

 improvement in chemicals shipments in addition plastics and industrial chemicals shipments increased as low natural gas prices have made us chemicals more cost competitive globally declines in potash due to temporary shutdowns and reduced production at several mines partially offset the increases in chemical shipments during the year 

 

 lower volume partially offset by pricing gains and fuel surcharge recoveries reduced freight revenue from coal shipments in 2012 compared to 2011 shipments of coal from the southern powder river basin sprb mines decreased 15 from 2011 above average coal stockpiles due to an unseasonably warm winter and low natural gas prices which caused some displacement of coal in electricity production led to 

  

the volume declines in addition the loss of two contracts to a competitor contributed to lower volumes from the sprb coal shipments from the colorado and utah mines increased 2 versus 2011 increased export shipments of colorado and utah coal in 2012 offset the domestic declines due to higher stockpiles and low natural gas prices 

 

 2011 shipments of nonmetallic minerals primarily frac sand grew in response to increased horizontal drilling activity for energy products more construction activity during a relatively mild winter led to higher demand for shipments of lumber cement and stone compared to 2011 the growth in housing starts throughout 2012 also increased lumber shipments up 12 from 2011 steel shipments finished slightly down from 2011 levels as lower demand for export scrap and mine production issues in the second half of the year offset increases in the first half due to higher demand for steel coils and plate for pipe and auto production 

 

 recovery provisions core pricing gains and volume growth increased freight revenue from intermodal shipments in 2012 volume levels from international traffic remained flat yearoveryear as the loss of a customer contract in the first half of the year offset modest west coast import growth domestic traffic increased 3 versus 2011 due to better market conditions and continued conversion of traffic from truck to rail 

mexico business – each of our commodity groups includes revenue from shipments to and from mexico revenue from mexico business increased 9 to 21 billion in 2013 versus 2012 shipments were up 3 versus 2012 all commodity groups grew with the exception of agricultural products the largest growth came from automotive and industrial products shipments 

revenue from mexico business increased 8 to 19 billion in 2012 versus 2011 volume levels for four of the six commodity groups industrial products and agricultural products declined were up 5 in aggregate versus 2011 with particularly strong growth in automotive and intermodal shipments 

  

operating expenses 

 

  

 volume related fuel savings 2 fewer gallons of fuel consumed and 38 million of weather related expenses in 2011 which favorably affects the comparison partially offset the cost increase 

compensation and benefits – compensation and benefits include wages payroll taxes health and welfare costs pension costs other postretirement benefits and incentive costs general wages and benefits inflation higher work force levels and increased pension and other postretirement benefits drove the increases in 2013 versus 2012 the impact of ongoing productivity initiatives partially offset these increases 

expenses in 2012 were essentially flat versus 2011 as operational improvements and cost reductions offset general wage and benefit inflation and higher pension and other postretirement benefits in addition weather related costs increased these expenses in 2011 

fuel – fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and nonhighway vehicles and heavy equipment lower locomotive diesel fuel prices which averaged 315 per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in 2013 compared to 322 in 2012 decreased expenses by 75 million volume as measured by gross tonmiles decreased 1 while the fuel consumption rate computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross tonmiles increased 2 compared to 2012 declines in heavier more fuelefficient coal shipments drove the variances in grosstonmiles and the fuel consumption rate 

higher locomotive diesel fuel prices which averaged 322 per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in 2012 compared to 312 in 2011 increased expenses by 105 million volume as measured by gross tonmiles decreased 2 in 2012 versus 2011 driving expense down the fuel consumption rate was flat yearoveryear 

purchased services and materials – expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors and other service providers including equipment maintenance and contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services materials used to maintain the railroad’s lines structures and equipment costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other railroads transportation and lodging for train crew employees trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers leased automobile maintenance expenses and tools and 

  

supplies expenses for purchased services increased 10 compared to 2012 due to logistics management fees an increase in locomotive overhauls and repairs on jointly owned property 

expenses for contract services increased 103 million in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to increased demand for transportation services purchased by our logistics subsidiaries for their customers and additional costs for repair and maintenance of locomotives and freight cars 

depreciation – the majority of depreciation relates to road property including rail ties ballast and other track material depreciation was up 1 compared to 2012 recent depreciation studies allowed us to use longer estimated service lives for certain equipment which partially offset the impact of a higher depreciable asset base resulting from larger capital spending in recent years 

a higher depreciable asset base reflecting ongoing capital spending increased depreciation expense in 2012 compared to 2011 

equipment and other rents – equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies freight car intermodal and locomotive leases and office and other rent expenses additional container costs resulting from the logistics management arrangement and increased automotive shipments partially offset by lower cycle times drove a 51 million increase in our shortterm freight car rental expense versus 2012 conversely lower locomotive and freight car lease expenses partially offset the higher freight car rental expense 

increased automotive and intermodal shipments partially offset by improved carcycle times drove an increase in our shortterm freight car rental expense in 2012 compared to 2011 conversely lower locomotive lease expense partially offset the higher freight car rental expense 

other – other expenses include state and local taxes freight equipment and property damage utilities insurance personal injury environmental employee travel telephone and cellular computer software bad debt and other general expenses higher property taxes and costs associated with damaged freight and property increased other costs in 2013 compared to 2012 continued improvement in our safety performance and lower estimated liability for personal injury which reduced our personal injury expense yearoveryear partially offset increases in other costs 

other costs in 2012 were slightly higher than 2011 primarily due to higher property taxes despite continual improvement in our safety experience and lower estimated annual costs personal injury expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 as the liability reduction resulting from historical claim experience was less than the reduction in 2011 

nonoperating items 

 

 other income – other income increased in 2013 versus 2012 due to higher gains from real estate sales and increased lease income including the favorable impact from the 17 million settlement of a land lease contract these increases were partially offset by interest received from a tax refund in 2012 

other income decreased in 2012 versus 2011 due to lower gains from real estate sales and higher environmental costs associated with nonoperating properties partially offset by interest received from a tax refund 

interest expense – interest expense decreased in 2013 versus 2012 due to a lower effective interest rate of 57 in 2013 versus 60 in 2012 the increase in the weightedaverage debt level to 96 billion in 2013 from 91 billion in 2012 partially offset the impact of the lower effective interest rate 

interest expense decreased in 2012 versus 2011 reflecting a lower effective interest rate in 2012 of 60 versus 62 in 2011 as the debt level did not materially change from 2011 to 2012 

  

income taxes – higher pretax income increased income taxes in 2013 compared to 2012 our effective tax rate for 2013 was relatively flat at 377 compared to 376 in 2012 

income taxes were higher in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily driven by higher pretax income our effective tax rate remained relatively flat at 376 in 2012 compared to 375 in 2011 

other operatingperformance and financial statistics 

we report a number of key performance measures weekly to the association of american railroads aar we provide this data on our website at wwwupcominvestorsreportsindexshtml 

operatingperformance statistics 

railroad performance measures are included in the table below 

 

  

 note average rail car inventory is no longer being reported as a key railroad performance measure because of recently identified inaccuracies in the aar’s calculation for the rail industry which prevents comparisons to prior reporting periods the impact of changes in rail car inventory will be described as necessary in connection with our discussion of train speed andor terminal dwell metrics 

average train speed – average train speed is calculated by dividing train miles by hours operated on our main lines between terminals average train speed as reported to the association of american railroads aar decreased 2 in 2013 versus 2012 the decline was driven by severe weather conditions and shifts of traffic to sections of our network with higher utilization 

average train speed increased 4 in 2012 versus 2011 efficient operations and relatively mild weather conditions during the year compared favorably to 2011 during which severe winter weather flooding and extreme heat and drought affected various parts of our network we continued operating a fluid and efficient network while handling essentially the same volume and adjusting operations to accommodate increased capital project work on our network compared to 2011 

average terminal dwell time – average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our terminals lower average terminal dwell time improves asset utilization and service average terminal dwell time increased 3 primarily due to continuing growth of manifest traffic which requires more time in terminals for switching cars and building trains average terminal dwell time remained flat in 2012 compared to 2011 despite a shift in traffic mix to more manifest shipments which require more switching at terminals 

gross and revenue tonmiles – gross tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled revenue tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles gross tonmiles and revenue tonmiles declined 1 in 2013 compared to 2012 and carloads remained relatively flat driven by declines in coal and agricultural products offset by growth in chemical autos and industrial products gross tonmiles declined 2 in 2012 compared to 2011 while revenue tonmiles decreased 4 and carloads remained relatively flat changes in commodity mix drove the yearoveryear variances between gross tonmiles revenue tonmiles and carloads 

  

operating ratio – operating ratio is our operating expenses reflected as a percentage of operating revenue our operating ratio improved 17 points to a new record low of 661 in 2013 versus 2012 core pricing and productivity gains more than offset the impact of inflation our operating ratio improved 29 points to a record low of 678 in 2012 versus 2011 core pricing gains improved fuel recovery provisions efficient operations and cost reductions more than offset the impact of inflationary pressures 

employees – employee levels increased 1 in 2013 versus 2012 shifts in our traffic mix which requires more resources largely concentrated in the southern region work related to higher capital investment in positive train control and more individuals in the training pipeline contributed to the higher employee levels employee levels increased 2 in 2012 versus 2011 work related to the increase in capital investment including positive train control accounted for over half of the increase additionally the shift in our traffic mix required more resources in the southern region to support the growth in shalerelated shipments 

customer satisfaction index – our customer satisfaction survey asks customers to rate how satisfied they are with our performance over the last 12 months on a variety of attributes a higher score indicates higher customer satisfaction as of january 1 2014 we significantly changed the methodology for compiling our customer satisfaction information and as a result we will not include this index in future reports as no meaningful comparison is available 

return on average common shareholders’ equity 

 

 return on invested capital as adjusted roic 

 

 roic is considered a nongaap financial measure by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe this measure is important in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our longterm capital investments in addition we currently use roic as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of equity compensation for our executives roic should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for other information provided in accordance with gaap the most comparable gaap measure is return on average common shareholders’ equity the tables above provide reconciliations from return on average common shareholders’ equity to roic our 2013 roic improved 07 points compared to 2012 primarily as a result of higher earnings 

  

debt to capital  adjusted debt to capital 

 

 adjusted debt to capital is a nongaap financial measure under sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the total amount of leverage in our capital structure including offbalance sheet lease obligations which we generally incur in connection with financing the acquisition of locomotives and freight cars and certain facilities operating leases were discounted using 57 and 60 at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the discount rate reflects our effective interest rate we monitor the ratio of adjusted debt to capital as we manage our capital structure to balance costeffective and efficient access to the capital markets with our overall cost of capital adjusted debt to capital should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for debt to capital the tables above provide reconciliations from debt to capital to adjusted debt to capital our december 31 2013 debt to capital ratios decreased as a result of a 13 billion increase in equity from december 31 2012 driven by higher earnings 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2013 our principal sources of liquidity included cash cash equivalents our receivables securitization facility and our revolving credit facility as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets we had 18 billion of committed credit available under our credit facility with no borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2013 we did not make any borrowings under this facility during 2013 the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the 600 million capacity receivables securitization facility was 0 as of december 31 2013 amounts outstanding under this facility are included in our consolidated statements of financial position as debt due after one year our access to this receivables securitization facility may be reduced or restricted if our bond ratings fall to certain levels below investment grade if our bond rating were to deteriorate it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financings is dependent on market conditions deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability we expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity through any or all of the following sources or activities i increasing the size or utilization of our receivables securitization ii issuing commercial paper iii entering into bank loans outside of our revolving credit facility or iv issuing bonds or other debt securities to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets the company’s 18 billion revolving credit facility is intended to support the issuance of commercial paper by upc and also serves as an emergency source of liquidity the company currently does not intend to make any borrowings under this facility 

at december 31 2013 and 2012 we had a modest working capital surplus this reflects a strong cash position that provides enhanced liquidity in an uncertain economic environment in addition we believe we have adequate access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

  

 operating activities 

higher net income in 2013 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2012 in addition we made payments in 2012 for past wages as a result of national labor negotiations which reduced cash provided by operating activities in 2012 lower tax benefits from bonus depreciation as discussed below partially offset some of the increases 

higher net income in 2012 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2011 partially offset by lower tax benefits from bonus depreciation and payments for past wages based on national labor negotiations settled in 2012 

federal tax law provided for 100 bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2011 and 50 bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2012 and 2013 as a result the company deferred a substantial portion of its 2011 2012 and 2013 income tax expense this deferral decreased 2011 2012 and 2013 income tax payments thereby contributing to the positive operating cash flow in future years however income tax payments will increase as we pay these previously deferred income taxes 

investing activities 

lower capital investments in locomotives and freight cars drove the decrease in cash used in investing activities compared to 2012 

higher capital investments in 2012 drove the increase in cash used in investing activities compared to 2011 included in capital investments in 2012 was 75 million for the early buyout of 165 locomotives under longterm operating and capital leases during the first quarter of 2012 which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions 

the following tables detail cash capital investments and track statistics for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 

 

  

   

 capital plan – in 2014 we expect our total capital investments to be approximately 39 billion which may be revised if business conditions or the regulatory environment affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments while the number of our assets replaced will fluctuate as part of our replacement strategy for 2014 we expect to use over 60 of our capital investments to replace and improve existing capital assets among our major investment categories are replacing and improving track infrastructure and upgrading our locomotive freight car and container fleets including the acquisition of 200 locomotives additionally we will continue increasing our network and terminal capacity especially in the southern region and balancing terminal capacity with more mainline capacity construction of a major rail facility at santa teresa new mexico will be completed in 2014 and will include a runthrough and fueling facility as well as an intermodal ramp we also plan to make significant investments in technology improvements including approximately 450 million for ptc 

we expect to fund our 2014 cash capital investments by using some or all of the following cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and cash on hand our annual capital plan is a critical component of our longterm strategic plan which we expect will enhance the longterm value of the corporation for our shareholders by providing sufficient resources to i replace and improve our existing track infrastructure to provide safe and fluid operations ii increase network efficiency by adding or improving facilities and track and iii make investments that meet customer demand and take advantage of opportunities for longterm growth 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities increased in 2013 versus 2012 driven by a 744 million increase for the repurchase of shares under our common stock repurchase program and higher dividend payments in 2013 of 13 billion compared to 11 billion in 2012 we increased our debt levels in 2013 which partially offset the increase in cash used in financing activities 

cash used in financing activities increased in 2012 versus 2011 dividend payments in 2012 increased by 309 million reflecting our higher dividend rate and common stock repurchases increased by 56 million our debt levels did not materially change from 2011 after a decline in debt levels from 2010 therefore less cash was used in 2012 for debt activity than in 2011 

dividends – on february 6 2014 we increased the quarterly dividend to 091 per share payable on april 1 2014 to shareholders of record on february 28 2014 we expect to fund the increase in the quarterly dividend through cash generated from operations and cash on hand at december 31 2013 

credit facilities – on december 31 2013 we had 18 billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility the facility which is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper we did not draw on the facility during 2013 commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investmentgrade borrowers the facility allows for borrowings at floating rates based on london interbank offered rates plus a spread depending upon credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt the facility matures in 2015 under a four year term and requires the corporation to maintain a debttonetworth coverage ratio as a condition to making a borrowing at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 and at all times during the year we were in compliance with this covenant 

the definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the debttonetworth coverage ratio includes among other things certain credit arrangements capital leases guarantees and unfunded and vested pension benefits under title iv of erisa at december 31 2013 the debttonetworth coverage ratio allowed us to carry up to 424 billion of debt as defined in the facility and we had 99 billion of debt as defined in the facility outstanding at that date under our current capital plans we expect to continue to satisfy the debttonetworth coverage ratio however many factors beyond our reasonable control 

  

could affect our ability to comply with this provision in the future the facility does not include any other financial restrictions credit rating triggers other than ratingdependent pricing or any other provision that could require us to post collateral the facility also includes a 75 million crossdefault provision and a changeofcontrol provision 

during 2013 we did not issue or repay any commercial paper and at december 31 2013 and 2012 we had no commercial paper outstanding our revolving credit facility supports our outstanding commercial paper balances and unless we change the terms of our commercial paper program our aggregate issuance of commercial paper will not exceed the amount of borrowings available under the facility 

as of december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 we have reclassified as longterm debt 0 and 100 million respectively of debt due within one year that we intend to refinance this reclassification reflects our ability and intent to refinance any shortterm borrowings and certain current maturities of longterm debt on a longterm basis 

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

for each of the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 118 104 and 84 respectively the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis earnings represent income from continuing operations less equity earnings net of distributions plus fixed charges and income taxes fixed charges represent interest charges amortization of debt discount and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges see exhibit 12 to this report for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

common shareholders’ equity 

dividend restrictions – our revolving credit facility includes a debttonet worth covenant discussed in the credit facilities section above that under certain circumstances restricts the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders the amount of retained earnings available for dividends was 163 billion and 151 billion at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively

effective april 1 2011 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of 40 million shares of our common stock by march 31 2014 replacing our previous repurchase program as of december 31 2013 we repurchased a total of 93 billion of our common stock since the commencement of our repurchase programs the table below represents shares repurchased under this repurchase program 

 

 on november 21 2013 our board of directors approved the early renewal of the share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to 60 million shares of our common stock by december 31 2017 the new authorization was effective january 1 2014 and replaces the previous authorization which expired on december 31 2013 three months earlier than its original expiration date 

management’s assessments of market conditions and other pertinent facts guide the timing and volume of all repurchases we expect to fund any share repurchases under this program through cash generated from operations the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties debt issuances and cash on hand repurchased shares are recorded in treasury stock at cost which includes any applicable commissions and fees 

shelf registration statement and significant new borrowings – we filed an automatic shelf registration statement that became effective on february 8 2013 the board of directors authorized the 

  

issuance of up to 4 billion of debt securities replacing the 14 billion of authority remaining under our shelf registration filed in february 2010 sec rules require upc a large accelerated filer to file a new shelf registration statement every three years under the current shelf registration we may issue from time to time any combination of debt securities preferred stock common stock or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings we have no immediate plans to issue equity securities however we will continue to explore opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under our shelf registration and therefore we may issue additional debt securities at any time 

during 2013 we issued the following unsecured fixedrate debt securities under our current shelf registration 

 

 we used the net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes including the repurchase of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program these debt securities include changeofcontrol provisions at december 31 2013 we had remaining authority to issue up to 285 billion of debt securities under our shelf registration 

in may 2012 we borrowed 100 million under a 4yearterm bank loan the loan the loan has a floating rate based on london interbank offered rates plus a spread and is prepayable in whole or in part without a premium prior to maturity the agreement documenting the loan has provisions similar to our revolving credit facility including identical debttonetworth covenant and change of control provisions and similar customary default provisions the agreement does not include any other financial restrictions credit rating triggers or any other provision that would require us to post collateral 

subsequent event – in 2014 we issued the following unsecured fixedrate debt securities under our current shelf registration 

 

 proceeds from this offering are for general corporate purposes including the repurchase of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program these debt securities include changeofcontrol provisions as of february 7 2014 we had remaining authority from our board of directors to issue up to 185 billion of debt securities under our shelf registration 

debt exchange – on august 21 2013 we exchanged 1170 million of various outstanding notes and debentures due between 2016 and 2040 existing notes for 439 million of 3646 notes new 2024 notes due february 15 2024 and 700 million of 4821 notes new 2044 notes due february 1 2044 plus cash consideration of approximately 280 million in addition to 8 million for accrued and unpaid interest on the existing notes in accordance with asc 4705040 debtmodifications and extinguishmentsderecognition this transaction was accounted for as a debt exchange as the exchanged debt instruments are not considered to be substantially different the cash consideration was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of debt and the balance of the unamortized discount and issue costs from the existing notes is being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the terms of the new 2024 notes and the new 2044 notes no gain or loss was recognized as a result of the exchange costs related to the debt exchange that were payable to parties other than the debt holders totaled approximately 9 million and were included in interest expense during the three months ended september 30 2013 

  

the following table lists the outstanding notes and debentures that were exchanged 

 

 debt redemptions – on may 14 2013 we redeemed all 40 million of our outstanding 565 port of corpus christi authority revenue refunding bonds due december 1 2022 the redemption resulted in an early extinguishment charge of 1 million in the second quarter of 2013 

on november 30 2012 we redeemed all 450 million of our outstanding 545 notes due january 31 2013 the redemption resulted in an early extinguishment charge of 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 

on april 28 2012 we redeemed all 100 million of our outstanding 570 tooele county utah hazardous waste treatment revenue bonds due november 1 2026 the redemption resulted in an early extinguishment charge of 2 million in the second quarter of 2012 

on december 19 2011 we redeemed the remaining 175 million of our 65 notes due april 15 2012 and all 300 million of our outstanding 6125 notes due january 15 2012 the redemptions resulted in an early extinguishment charge of 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 

receivables securitization facility – the railroad maintains a 600 million 364day receivables securitization facility under which it sells most of its eligible thirdparty receivables to union pacific receivables inc upri a whollyowned bankruptcyremote subsidiary that may subsequently transfer without recourse an undivided interest in accounts receivable to investors the investors have no recourse to the railroad’s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims creditors of the railroad do not have recourse to the assets of upri 

the amount outstanding under the facility was 0 and 100 million at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively the facility was supported by 11 billion of accounts receivable as collateral at both december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 which as a retained interest is included in accounts receivable net in our condensed consolidated statements of financial position 

the outstanding amount the railroad is allowed to maintain under the facility with a maximum of 600 million may fluctuate based on the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by business volumes and credit risks including receivables payment quality measures such as default and dilution ratios if default or dilution ratios increase one percent the allowable outstanding amount under the facility would not materially change 

the costs of the receivables securitization facility include interest which will vary based on prevailing commercial paper rates program fees paid to banks commercial paper issuing costs and fees for unused commitment availability the costs of the receivables securitization facility are included in interest expense and were 5 million 3 million and 4 million for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

  

in july 2013 the 600 million receivables securitization facility was renewed for an additional 364day period at comparable terms and conditions 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and as referenced in the tables below we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments including material sources of offbalance sheet and structured finance arrangements other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets as described in item 1a of part ii of this report there is no known trend demand commitment event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition our commercial obligations financings and commitments are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations particularly within the transportation industry 

the following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of december 31 2013 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

offbalance sheet arrangements 

guarantees – at december 31 2013 and 2012 we were contingently liable for 299 million and 307 million in guarantees we have recorded a liability of 1 million and 2 million for the fair value of these obligations as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business and they include guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building equipment financings and affiliated operations the final guarantee expires in 2022 we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

other matters 

labor agreements – approximately 86 of our 46445 fulltimeequivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions in 2012 we concluded the most recent round of negotiations which began in 2010 with the ratification of new agreements by several unions all of the unions executed similar multiyear agreements that provide for higher employee cost sharing of employee health and welfare benefits and higher wages the current agreements will remain in effect until renegotiated under provisions of the railway labor act the next round of negotiations will begin in early 2015 

inflation – long periods of inflation significantly increase asset replacement costs for capitalintensive companies as a result assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels depreciation charges on an inflationadjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 

derivative financial instruments – we may use derivative financial instruments in limited instances to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and fuel prices we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged both at inception and throughout the hedged period we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items at inception as well as our riskmanagement objectives strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness changes in the fair market value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are charged to earnings we may use swaps collars futures andor forward contracts to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in interest rates and fuel prices however the use of these derivative financial instruments may limit future benefits from favorable price movements 

market and credit risk – we address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item we manage credit risk related to derivative financial instruments which is minimal by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements at december 31 2013 and 2012 we were not required to provide collateral nor had we received collateral relating to our hedging activities 

determination of fair value – we determine the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or the present value of expected future cash flows 

sensitivity analyses – the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 

at december 31 2013 we had variablerate debt representing approximately 22 of our total debt if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2014 than our december 31 2013 variable rate which was approximately 09 our interest expense would increase by approximately 2 million this amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balances of our variablerate debt at december 31 2013 

market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2013 and amounts to an increase of approximately 1 billion to the fair value of our debt at december 31 2013 we estimated the fair values of our fixedrate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 

  

interest rate fair value hedges – we manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period we generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings we employ derivatives primarily swaps as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix in addition we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixedrate debt securities 

swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt’s fair value attributable to the changes in interest rates we account for swaps as fair value hedges using the shortcut method as allowed by the derivatives and hedging topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb asc therefore we do not record any ineffectiveness within our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we had no interest rate fair value hedges outstanding 

interest rate cash flow hedges – we report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affects earnings at both december 31 2013 and 2012 we had reductions of 1 million recorded as an accumulated other comprehensive loss that is being amortized on a straightline basis through september 30 2014 as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding 

accounting pronouncements – on february 5 2013 the fasb issued accounting standards update 201302 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu 201302 which adds additional disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income we adopted this asu during the three months ended march 31 2013 

asserted and unasserted claims – various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries we cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity however to the extent possible where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated we have recorded a liability we do not expect that any known lawsuits claims environmental costs commitments contingent liabilities or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters 

indemnities – our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements including certain tax indemnifications can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions 

climate change – although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item 1a of this report we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact however we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment including investments in new technologies using training programs to reduce fuel consumption and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 2 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 these critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment 

  

and estimates if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 

personal injury – the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability including unasserted claims the federal employers’ liability act fela governs compensation for workrelated accidents under fela damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or outofcourt settlements we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 

our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments approximately 92 of the recorded liability is related to asserted claims and approximately 8 is related to unasserted claims at december 31 2013 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 294 million to 322 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation 

our personal injury liability activity was as follows 

 

 our personal injury claims activity was as follows 

 

 asbestos – we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other parties allege exposure to asbestos we assess our potential liability using a statistical analysis of resolution costs for asbestosrelated claims this liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing costs the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions 

 

    our liability for asbestosrelated claims is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments approximately 18 of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 82 related to unasserted claims at december 31 2013 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestosrelated claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 131 million to 141 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other 

  

our asbestosrelated liability activity was as follows 

 

 our asbestosrelated claims activity was as follows 

 

 in conjunction with the liability update performed in 2013 we also reassessed estimated insurance recoveries we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2013 and 2012 the amounts recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts however future events such as the number of new claims filed each year average settlement costs and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts estimates also may vary in the future if strategies activities and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change federal and state laws governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimants and there are material changes with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants 

environmental costs – we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations we have identified 268 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements this includes 33 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government 17 of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 

when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in our business we perform with assistance of our consultants environmental assessments on the property we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated we do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable at december 31 2013 and 2012 none of our environmental liability was discounted while less than 1 of our environmental liability was discounted at 20 at december 31 2011 

our environmental liability activity was as follows 

 

  

   

our environmental site activity was as follows 

 

 the environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties cost estimates are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and existing technology laws and regulations the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties sitespecific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal state and local laws governing environmental remediation current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

property and depreciation – our railroad operations are highly capital intensive and our large base of homogeneous networktype assets turns over on a continuous basis each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated service lives which are measured in years except for rail in highdensity traffic corridors ie all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment yard and switching tracks and electronic yards for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics use and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources not as singular items we currently have more than 60 depreciable asset classes and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology asset strategies or other factors 

we determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property by means of depreciation studies we perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets ie rail and other track material ties and ballast and other road property our depreciation studies take into account the following factors 

 

    for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track it has been our experience that the lives of rail in highdensity traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage ie the amount of weight carried over the rail the service lives also vary based on rail weight rail condition eg new or secondhand and rail type eg straight or curve our depreciation studies for rail in high density traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross tonmiles carried over the rail ie the weight of loaded and empty freight cars locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile rail in highdensity traffic corridors accounts for approximately 70 percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material based on the number of gross tonmiles carried over our rail in high density traffic corridors during 2013 the estimated service lives of the majority of this rail ranged from approximately 15 years to approximately 30 years for all other depreciable assets we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives 

  

of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively 

estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to changes in physical use technology asset strategies and other factors that will have an impact on the retirement profiles of our assets we are not aware of any specific factors that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service lives of our assets actual use and retirement of our assets may vary from our current estimates which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future periods 

changes in estimated useful lives of our assets due to the results of our depreciation studies could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately 59 million if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were decreased by one year annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately 63 million our recent depreciation studies have resulted in changes in depreciation rates for some asset classes but did not significantly affect our annual depreciation expense 

under group depreciation the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using i inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ii the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate in addition we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies any deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets 

for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions i is unusual ii is material in amount and iii varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies during the last three fiscal years no gains or losses were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad properties a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations 

income taxes – we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns these expected future tax consequences are measured based on current tax law the effects of future tax legislation are not anticipated future tax legislation such as a change in the corporate tax rate could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity for example a 1 increase in future income tax rates would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately 370 million 

when appropriate we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reflect that these tax assets may not be realized in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized based on management’s judgments using available evidence for purposes of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize a deferred tax asset in 2013 and 2012 there were no valuation allowances 

we recognize tax benefits that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement a liability for “unrecognized tax benefits” is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards 

pension and other postretirement benefits – we use an actuarial analysis to measure the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and medical and life insurance benefits opeb to eligible employees in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make 

  

several assumptions the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets for opeb the critical assumptions are the discount rate and health care cost trend rate 

we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually and selected assumptions are based on the following factors 

 

   the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit for 2013 and the estimated impact on 2013 net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit relative to a change in those assumptions 

 

 the following table presents the net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit for the years ended december 31 

 

 our net periodic pension cost is expected to decrease to approximately 65 million in 2014 from 110 million in 2013 the decrease is driven mainly by an increase in the discount rate to 472 our net periodic opeb expense is expected to increase to approximately 15 million in 2014 from 14 million in 2013 the increase in our net periodic opeb cost is primarily driven by a decrease in the amortization of prior service credits from accumulated other comprehensive income

 item 9a controls and procedures 

as of the end of the period covered by this report the corporation carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the corporation’s management including the corporation’s chief executive officer ceo and executive vice president – finance and chief financial officer cfo of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to exchange act rules 13a15 and 15d15 in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives based upon that evaluation the ceo and the cfo concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report the corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the sec and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

additionally the ceo and cfo determined that there were no changes to the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting 

  

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

the management of union pacific corporation and subsidiary companies the corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f the corporation’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the corporation’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 

all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

the corporation’s management assessed the effectiveness of the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 in making this assessment it used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control – integrated framework 1992 based on our assessment management believes that as of december 31 2013 the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 

the corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting this report appears on the next page 

february 6 2014 

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

to the board of directors and shareholders of union pacific corporation

automotive – we are the largest automotive carrier west of the mississippi river and operate or access over 40 vehicle distribution centers the railroad’s extensive franchise serves vehicle assembly plants and connects to west coast ports and the port of houston to accommodate both import and export shipments in addition to transporting finished vehicles up provides expedited handling of automotive parts in both boxcars and intermodal containers destined for mexico the us and canada the automotive group generated 9 of union pacific’s freight revenue in 2012 

chemicals – transporting chemicals generated 16 of our freight revenue in 2012 the railroad’s unique franchise serves the chemical producing areas along the gulf coast where roughly twothirds of the company’s chemical business originates terminates or travels our chemical franchise also accesses chemical producers in the rocky mountains and on the west coast the company’s chemical shipments include three broad categories petrochemicals fertilizer and soda ash petrochemicals include industrial chemicals plastics and petroleum products including crude oil and liquid petroleum gases the petroleum products primarily originate from the bakken shale formation in north dakota and the permian and eagle ford shale formations in texas which we also deliver to the gulf coast area fertilizer movements originate in the gulf coast region the western part of the us and canada for delivery to major agricultural users in the midwest western us and abroad soda ash originates in southwestern wyoming and california destined for chemical and glass producing markets in north america and abroad 

coal – shipments of coal and petroleum coke accounted for 20 of our freight revenue in 2012 the railroad’s network supports the transportation of coal and petroleum coke to utilities and industrial facilities throughout the us through interchange gateways and ports up’s reach extends to eastern us utilities mexico europe and asia water terminals allow the railroad to move western us coal east via the mississippi and ohio rivers as well as the great lakes export coal moves through west coast ports to asia and through mississippi river and gulf coast terminals to europe coal traffic originating in the southern powder river basin sprb area of wyoming is the largest segment of up’s coal business 

industrial products – our extensive network facilitates the movement of numerous commodities between thousands of origin and destination points throughout north america the industrial products commodity group consists of several categories including construction products metals minerals paper consumer 

  

goods lumber and other miscellaneous products in 2012 this group generated 18 of union pacific’s total freight revenue commercial and highway construction drives shipments of steel and construction products consisting of rock cement and roofing materials oil and gas drilling generates demand for raw steel finished pipe frac sand and drilling fluid products industrial manufacturing plants receive nonferrous metals and industrial minerals paper and consumer goods including furniture and appliances move to major metropolitan areas for consumers lumber shipments originate primarily in the pacific northwest and canada and move throughout the us for use in new home construction and repair and remodeling

seasonality – some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons reflecting either or both the nature of the commodity such as certain agricultural and food products that have specific growing and harvesting seasons and the demand cycle for the commodity such as intermodal traffic which generally has a peak shipping season during the third quarter to meet holidayrelated demand for consumer goods during the fourth quarter the peak shipping seasons for these commodities can vary considerably from year to year depending upon various factors including the strength of domestic and international economies and currencies and the strength of harvests and market prices for agricultural products in response to an annual request delivered by the surface transportation board stb of the us department of transportation dot to all of the class i railroads operating in the us we issue a publicly available letter during the third quarter detailing our plans for handling traffic during the third and fourth quarters and providing other information requested by the stb 

working capital – at december 31 2012 and 2011 we had a working capital surplus this reflects a strong cash position which provides enhanced liquidity in an uncertain economic environment in addition we believe we have adequate access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

competition – we are subject to competition from other railroads motor carriers ship and barge operators and pipelines our main rail competitor is burlington northern santa fe llc its rail subsidiary bnsf railway company bnsf operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors in addition we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers motor carrier competition exists for five of our six commodity groups excluding coal because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and gulf coast waterways barges can be particularly competitive especially for grain and bulk commodities in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service while we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation or legislation releasing motor carriers from their size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

key suppliers – we depend on two key domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives due to the capital intensive nature of the locomotive manufacturing business and sophistication of this equipment potential new suppliers face high barriers of entry into this industry therefore if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives for any reason including insolvency or bankruptcy we could experience a significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations additionally for a high percentage of our rail purchases we utilize two suppliers one domestic and one international that meet our specifications rail is critical for both maintenance of our network and replacement and improvement or expansion of our network and facilities rail manufacturing also has high barriers of entry and if one of those suppliers discontinues operations for any reason including insolvency or bankruptcy we could experience cost increases and difficulty obtaining rail 

employees – approximately 86 of our 45928 fulltimeequivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions during the year we concluded the most recent round of negotiations which began in 

  

2010 with the ratification of new agreements by several unions that continued negotiating into 2012 all of the unions executed similar multiyear agreements that provide for higher employee cost sharing of employee health and welfare benefits and higher wages the current agreements will remain in effect until renegotiated under provisions of the railway labor act the next round of negotiations will begin in early 2015 

railroad security – our security efforts rely upon a wide variety of measures including employee training cooperation with our customers training of emergency responders and partnerships with numerous federal state and local government agencies while federal law requires us to protect the confidentiality of our security plans designed to safeguard against terrorism and other security incidents the following provides a general overview of our security initiatives 

uprr security measures – we maintain a comprehensive security plan designed to both deter and to respond to any potential or actual threats as they arise the plan includes four levels of alert status each with its own set of countermeasures we employ our own police force consisting of more than 200 commissioned and highlytrained officers our employees also undergo recurrent security and preparedness training as well as federallymandated hazardous materials and security training we regularly review the sufficiency of our employee training programs we maintain the capability to move critical operations to backup facilities in different locations 

we have an emergency response management center which operates 24 hours a day the center receives reports of emergencies dangerous or potentially dangerous conditions and other safety and security issues from our employees the public and law enforcement and other government officials in cooperation with government officials we monitor both threats and public events and as necessary we may alter rail traffic flow at times of concern to minimize risk to communities and our operations we comply with the hazardous materials routing rules and other requirements imposed by federal law we also design our operating plan to expedite the movement of hazardous material shipments to minimize the time rail cars remain idle at yards and terminals located in or near major population centers additionally in compliance with transportation security agency regulations we deployed information systems and instructed employees in tracking and documenting the handoff of rail security sensitive material with customers and interchange partners 

we also have established a number of our own innovative safety and securityoriented initiatives ranging from various investments in technology to the officer on the train program which provides local law enforcement officers with the opportunity to ride with train crews to enhance their understanding of railroad operations and risks our staff of information security professionals continually assesses cyber security risks and implements mitigation programs that evolve with the changing technology threat environment 

cooperation with federal state and local government agencies – we work closely on physical and cyber security initiatives with government agencies that include the dot and the department of homeland security dhs as well as local police departments fire departments and other first responders in conjunction with dot dhs and other railroads we sponsor operation respond which provides first responders with secure links to electronic railroad resources including mapping systems shipment records and other essential information required by emergency personnel to respond to accidents and other situations we also participate in the national joint terrorism task force a multiagency effort established by the us department of justice and the federal bureau of investigation to combat and prevent terrorism 

we work with the coast guard us customs and border protection cbp and the military transport management command which monitor shipments entering the uprr rail network at us border crossings and ports we were the first railroad in the us to be named a partner in cbp’s customstrade partnership against terrorism a partnership designed to develop enhance and maintain effective security processes throughout the global supply chain 

cooperation with customers and trade associations – along with other railroads we work with the american chemistry council to train approximately 200000 emergency responders annually we work with many of our chemical shippers to establish plant security plans and we continue to take steps to more closely monitor and track hazardous materials shipments in cooperation with the federal railroad administration fra and other interested groups we are also working to develop additional improvements to tank car design that will further limit the risk of releases of hazardous materials 

  

governmental and environmental regulation 

governmental regulation – our operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local regulations generally applicable to all businesses see also the discussion of certain regulatory proceedings in legal proceedings item 3 

the operations of the railroad are also subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the stb the stb has jurisdiction over rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic common carrier service of regulated traffic freight car compensation transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines and acquisition of control of rail common carriers in 2012 the stb continued its efforts to explore whether to expand rail regulation the stb has requested parties to submit studies that describe and quantify the potential impact of expanded reciprocal switching or trackage rights arrangements on railroads although several bills involving railroad regulation expired during the last session of congress we continually monitor any legislative activity involving rail and transportation regulation 

the operations of the railroad also are subject to the regulations of the fra and other federal and state agencies on january 12 2010 the fra issued initial rules governing installation of positive train control ptc by the end of 2015 the final regulation is still forthcoming although still under development ptc is a collision avoidance technology intended to override locomotive controls and stop a train before an accident following the issuance of the initial rules the fra acknowledged that projected costs will exceed projected benefits by a ratio of at least 22 to one and we estimate that our costs will be higher than those assumed by the fra in august 2012 the fra provided congress with a status report regarding implementation of ptc this report indicated that the rail industry will likely achieve only partial deployment of ptc by the current deadline due to significant technical and other issues through 2012 we have invested nearly 750 million in the development of ptc 

dot the occupational safety and health administration and dhs along with other federal agencies have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety movement of hazardous materials and hazardous waste emissions requirements and equipment standards the rail safety improvement act of 2008 among other things revised hours of service rules for train and certain other railroad employees mandated implementation of ptc imposed passenger service requirements addressed safety at rail crossings increased the number of safety related employees of the fra and increased fines that may be levied against railroads for safety violations additionally various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law 

environmental regulation – we are subject to extensive federal and state environmental statutes and regulations pertaining to public health and the environment the statutes and regulations are administered and monitored by the environmental protection agency epa and by various state environmental agencies the primary laws affecting our operations are the resource conservation and recovery act regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act regulating the cleanup of contaminated properties the clean air act regulating air emissions and the clean water act regulating waste water discharges

 item 1a risk factors 

the information set forth in this item 1a should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this report including management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item 7 and financial statements and supplementary data item 8 

we must manage fluctuating demand for our services and network capacity – if there is significant demand for our services that exceeds the designed capacity of our network we may experience network difficulties including congestion and reduced velocity that could compromise the level of service we provide to our customers this level of demand may also compound the impact of weather and weatherrelated events on our operations and velocity although we continue to improve our transportation plan add capacity improve operations at our yards and other facilities and improve our ability to address surges in demand for any reason with adequate resources we cannot be sure that these measures will fully or adequately address any service shortcomings resulting from demand exceeding our planned capacity we may experience other operational or service difficulties related to network capacity dramatic and unplanned increases or decreases of demand for rail service with respect to one or more of our commodity groups or operating regions or other events that could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in the event that we experience significant reductions of demand for rail services with respect to one or more of our commodity groups we may experience increased costs associated with resizing our operations including higher unit operating costs and costs for the storage of locomotives rail cars and other equipment workforce adjustments and other related activities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we may be affected by general economic conditions – prolonged severe adverse domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of financial and credit markets including the availability of short and longterm debt financing may affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry and may have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity and our results of operations and financial condition 

we are required to transport hazardous materials – federal laws require railroads including us to transport certain hazardous materials regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss any rail accident or other incident or accident on our network at our facilities or at the facilities of our customers involving the release of hazardous materials including toxic inhalation hazard or tih materials such as chlorine could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury property damage and environmental penalties and remediation which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we face competition from other railroads and other transportation providers – we face competition from other railroads motor carriers ships barges and pipelines in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service while we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation or legislation releasing motor carriers from their size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect the competitive environment in which we operate 

we are subject to significant governmental regulation – we are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal state and local authorities covering a variety of health safety labor environmental economic as discussed below and other matters many laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses permits and other authorizations and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us governments or regulators may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate without providing us any recourse to address any adverse effects on our business including without limitation regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution business relationships with other railroads calculation of our cost of capital or other inputs relevant to computing our revenue adequacy the prices we charge and costs and expenses significant legislative activity in congress or regulatory activity by the stb could expand regulation of railroad operations and prices for rail services which could reduce capital spending on our rail network facilities and equipment and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity as part 

  

of the rail safety improvement act of 2008 rail carriers must currently implement ptc by the end of 2015 which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make other capital investments rail carriers may not meet the mandatory deadline for ptc implementation one or more consolidations of class i railroads could also lead to increased regulation of the rail industry 

we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations – we rely on information technology in all aspects of our business if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if we are unable to develop or implement new technology such as ptc or the latest version of our transportation control systems we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally if a cyber attack or other event causes significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment we could suffer a significant service interruption safety failure security breach or other operational difficulties which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations as the majority of our employees belong to labor unions and labor agreements – the us class i railroads are party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in among other things strikes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts which could cause a significant disruption of our operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could compromise our service reliability or significantly increase our costs for health care wages and other benefits which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures – as a railroad with a vast network we are exposed to severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods mudslides or landslides extreme temperatures and significant precipitation that may cause business interruptions including line outages on our rail network that can adversely affect our entire rail network and result in increased costs increased liabilities and decreased revenue which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures – as a railroad with operations in densely populated urban areas and other cities and a vast rail network we are exposed to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage environmental liability and other matters any material changes to litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving any or all of property damage personal injury and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to significant environmental laws and regulations – due to the nature of the railroad business our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waters handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and hazardous material or petroleum releases we generate and transport hazardous and nonhazardous waste in our operations and we did so in our former operations environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties leased properties and properties owned by third parties as well as to properties we currently own environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation we have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated or are strictly liable under these laws or regulations we could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we may be affected by climate change and market or regulatory responses to climate change – climate change including the impact of global warming could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gasses including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating 

  

costs restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that a use commodities that we carry to produce energy b use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry or c manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels including chemical producers farmers and food producers and automakers and other manufacturers significant cost increases government regulation or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns including for example the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers finally we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change any of these factors individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

the availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations – changes in demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to meet demand for rail service unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

rising or elevated fuel costs and whether we are able to mitigate these costs with fuel surcharges could materially and adversely affect our business – fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses diesel fuel prices are subject to dramatic fluctuations and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results although we currently are able to recover a significant amount of our increased fuel expenses through revenue from fuel surcharges we cannot be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elevated fuel costs through surcharges future market conditions or legislative or regulatory activities could adversely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharges or adequately recover increased fuel costs through fuel surcharges international political and economic circumstances affect fuel prices and supplies weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity if a fuel supply shortage were to arise higher fuel prices could despite our fuel surcharge programs have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we utilize capital markets – due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements we utilize longterm debt instruments bank financing and commercial paper from timetotime and we pledge certain of our receivables significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets including the credit markets or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to and significantly increase the cost of commercial paper and other financing sources including bank credit facilities and the issuance of longterm debt including corporate bonds a deterioration of our financial condition could result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade which could prohibit or restrict us from utilizing our current receivables securitization facility or accessing external sources of short and longterm debt financing and significantly increase the costs associated with utilizing the receivables securitization facility and issuing both commercial paper and longterm debt 

we are subject to legislative regulatory and legal developments involving taxes – taxes are a significant part of our expenses we are subject to us federal state and foreign income payroll property sales and use fuel and other types of taxes changes in tax rates enactment of new tax laws revisions of tax regulations and claims or litigation with taxing authorities could result in substantially higher taxes and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are dependent on certain key suppliers of locomotives and rail – due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry therefore if one of the domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives discontinues manufacturing locomotives for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience significant cost 

  

increases and reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary for our operations additionally for a high percentage of our rail purchases we utilize two suppliers one domestic and one international that meet our specifications rail is critical to our operations for rail replacement programs maintenance and for adding additional network capacity new rail and storage yards and expansions of existing facilities this industry similarly has high barriers to entry and if one of these suppliers discontinues operations for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience both significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail for maintenance and other projects 

we may be affected by acts of terrorism war or risk of war – our rail lines facilities and equipment including rail cars carrying hazardous materials could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks terrorist attacks or other similar events any government response thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in addition insurance premiums for some or all of our current coverages could increase dramatically or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future

the harriman dispatching center hdc located in omaha nebraska is our primary dispatching facility it is linked to regional dispatching and locomotive management facilities at various locations along our network hdc employees coordinate moves of locomotives and trains manage traffic and train crews on our network and coordinate interchanges with other railroads over 900 employees currently work onsite in the facility in the event of a disruption of operations at hdc due to a cyber attack flooding or severe weather or other event we maintain the capability to conduct critical operations at backup facilities in different locations 

rail facilities 

in addition to our track structure we operate numerous facilities including terminals for intermodal and other freight rail yards for trainbuilding classification yards switching storageintransit the temporary storage of customer goods in rail cars prior to shipment and other activities offices to administer and manage our operations dispatching centers to direct traffic on our rail network crew quarters to house train crews along our network and shops and other facilities for fueling maintenance and repair of locomotives and repair and maintenance of rail cars and other equipment the following tables include the major yards and terminals on our system 

 

   

 rail equipment 

our equipment includes owned and leased locomotives and rail cars heavy maintenance equipment and machinery other equipment and tools in our shops offices and facilities and vehicles for maintenance transportation of crews and other activities as of december 31 2012 we owned or leased the following units of equipment 

 

 capital expenditures 

our rail network requires significant annual capital investments for replacement improvement and expansion these investments enhance safety support the transportation needs of our customers and improve our operational efficiency additionally we add new locomotives and freight cars to our fleet to replace older less efficient equipment to support growth and customer demand and to reduce our impact on the environment through the acquisition of more fuel efficient and lowemission locomotives 

2012 capital expenditures – during 2012 we made capital investments totaling 37 billion see the capital expenditures table in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources – financial condition item 7 

  

2013 capital expenditures – in 2013 we expect to make capital investments of approximately 36 billion including expenditures for ptc of approximately 450 million we may revise our 2013 capital plan if business conditions warrant or if new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments see discussion of our 2013 capital plan in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – 2013 outlook item 7 

other 

equipment encumbrances – equipment with a carrying value of approximately 29 billion at both december 31 2012 and 2011 served as collateral for capital leases and other types of equipment obligations in accordance with the secured financing arrangements utilized to acquire such railroad equipment 

as a result of the merger of missouri pacific railroad company mprr with and into uprr on january 1 1997 and pursuant to the underlying indentures for the mprr mortgage bonds uprr must maintain the same value of assets after the merger in order to comply with the security requirements of the mortgage bonds as of the merger date the value of the mprr assets that secured the mortgage bonds was approximately 60 billion in accordance with the terms of the indentures this collateral value must be maintained during the entire term of the mortgage bonds irrespective of the outstanding balance of such bonds 

environmental matters – certain of our properties are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment see discussion of environmental issues in business – governmental and environmental regulation item 1 and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies – environmental item 7 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation that occur in connection with our business we routinely assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest available information and when necessary we seek input from our thirdparty advisors when making these assessments consistent with sec rules and requirements we describe below material pending legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities other proceedings arising under federal state or local environmental laws and regulations including governmental proceedings involving potential fines penalties or other monetary sanctions in excess of 100000 and such other pending matters that we may determine to be appropriate 

environmental matters 

on january 14 2013 the illinois attorney general’s office notified uprr that it will seek a penalty against the railroad for environmental conditions caused by its predecessor at a former locomotive fueling facility in south pekin illinois this former cnw facility discontinued fueling operations in the early 1980s subsequent environmental investigation revealed evidence of fuel releases to soil and groundwater in january 2007 the state rejected uprr’s proposed compliance commitment agreement and responded with a notice of intent to pursue legal action uprr continued to perform remedial investigations under the supervision of the illinois epa in june 2012 the illinois epa approved uprr’s proposed remedial action plan for the contaminated groundwater although no further action is required for the contamination the state is now seeking to recover a penalty the state has offered to settle the matter prior to litigation for payment of a 240000 penalty if we are unable to reach an agreement the state will pursue legal action for a penalty which we expect will exceed 100000 

we received notices from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are or may be liable under federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the us including sites on the superfund national priorities list or state superfund lists we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings and suits because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs 

  

information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies – environmental item 7 

other matters 

antitrust litigation – as we reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2007 20 small rail shippers many of whom are represented by the same law firms filed virtually identical antitrust lawsuits in various federal district courts against us and four other class i railroads in the us one railroad was eventually dropped from the lawsuit the original plaintiff filed the first of these claims in the us district court in new jersey on may 14 2007 and the additional plaintiffs filed claims in district courts in various states including florida illinois alabama pennsylvania and the district of columbia these suits allege that the named railroads engaged in pricefixing by establishing common fuel surcharges for certain rail traffic 

we received additional complaints following the initial claim increasing the total number of complaints to 30 in addition to suits filed by direct purchasers of rail transportation a few of the suits involved plaintiffs alleging that they are or were indirect purchasers of rail transportation and seeking to represent a purported class of indirect purchasers of rail transportation that paid fuel surcharges these complaints added allegations under state antitrust and consumer protection laws on november 6 2007 the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation ordered that all of the rail fuel surcharge cases be transferred to judge paul friedman of the us district court in the district of columbia for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings subsequently the direct purchaser plaintiffs and the indirect purchaser plaintiffs filed consolidated amended class action complaints against uprr and three other class i railroads 

one additional shipper filed a separate antitrust suit during 2008 subsequently the shipper voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice 

on october 10 2008 judge friedman heard oral arguments with respect to the defendant railroads’ motions to dismiss in a ruling on november 7 2008 judge friedman denied the motion with respect to the direct purchasers’ complaint and pretrial proceedings are underway in that case the status of which is described below on december 31 2008 judge friedman dismissed the complaints of the indirect purchasers based upon state antitrust consumer protection and unjust enrichment laws he also ruled however that these plaintiffs could proceed with their claim for injunctive relief under the federal antitrust laws which is identical to a claim by the direct purchaser plaintiffs the indirect purchasers appealed judge friedman’s ruling to the us court of appeals for the district of columbia on april 16 2010 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia affirmed judge friedman’s ruling dismissing the indirect purchasers’ claims based on various state laws 

with respect to the direct purchasers’ complaint judge friedman conducted a twoday hearing on october 6 and 7 2010 on the class certification issue and the railroad defendants’ motion to exclude evidence of interline communications on april 7 2011 judge friedman issued an order deferring any decision on class certification until the supreme court issued its decision in the walmart employment discrimination case 

on june 21 2012 judge friedman issued his decision certifying a class of plaintiffs to be represented by the eight named plaintiffs the class includes all shippers that paid a ratebased fuel surcharge to any one of the defendant railroads for rateunregulated rail transportation from july 1 2003 through december 1 2008 this is a procedural ruling which does not affirm any of the claims asserted by the plaintiffs and does not affect the ability of the railroad defendants to disprove the allegations made by the plaintiffs on july 5 2012 the defendant railroads filed a petition with the us court of appeals for the district of columbia requesting that the court review the class certification ruling on august 28 2012 a panel of the circuit court of the district of columbia referred the petition to a merits panel of the court to address the issues in the petition and to address whether the district court properly granted class certification 

we deny the allegations that our fuel surcharge programs violate the antitrust laws or any other laws we believe that these lawsuits are without merit and we will vigorously defend our actions therefore we currently believe that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on any of our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

 results of operations 

operating revenues 

 

 we generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our six commodity groups freight revenues vary with volume carloads and average revenue per car arc changes in price traffic mix and fuel surcharges drive arc we provide some of our customers with contractual incentives for meeting or exceeding specified cumulative volumes or shipping to and from specific locations which we record as reductions to freight revenues based on the actual or projected future shipments we recognize freight revenues as shipments move from origin to destination we allocate freight revenues between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them 

other revenues include revenues earned by our subsidiaries revenues from our commuter rail operations and accessorial revenues which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us or when we perform additional services such as switching or storage we recognize other revenues as we perform services or meet contractual obligations 

freight revenues from four of our six commodity groups increased during 2012 compared to 2011 revenues from coal and agricultural products declined during the year our franchise diversity allowed us to take advantage of growth from shalerelated markets crude oil frac sand and pipe and strong automotive manufacturing which offset volume declines from coal and agricultural products arc increased 7 driven by core pricing gains and higher fuel cost recoveries improved fuel recovery provisions and higher fuel prices including the lag effect of our programs surcharges trail fluctuations in fuel price by approximately two months combined to increase revenues from fuel surcharges 

freight revenues for all six commodity groups increased during 2011 compared to 2010 while volume increased in all commodity groups except intermodal increased demand in many market sectors with particularly strong growth in chemicals industrial products and automotive shipments for the year generated the increases arc increased 12 driven by higher fuel cost recoveries and core pricing gains fuel cost recoveries include fuel surcharge revenue and the impact of resetting the base fuel price for certain traffic higher fuel prices volume growth and new fuel surcharge provisions in renegotiated contracts all combined to increase revenues from fuel surcharges 

our fuel surcharge programs excluding indexbased contract escalators that contain some provision for fuel generated freight revenues of 26 billion 22 billion and 12 billion in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively ongoing rising fuel prices and increased fuel surcharge coverage drove the increases additionally fuel surcharge revenue is not entirely comparable to prior periods as we continue to convert portions of our nonregulated traffic to mileagebased fuel surcharge programs 

  

in 2012 other revenues increased from 2011 due primarily to higher revenues at our subsidiaries that broker intermodal and automotive services assessorial revenues also increased in 2012 due to container revenue related to an increase in intermodal shipments 

in 2011 other revenues increased from 2010 due primarily to higher revenues at our subsidiaries that broker intermodal and automotive services 

the following tables summarize the yearoveryear changes in freight revenues revenue carloads and arc by commodity type 

 

  

   

  

  

  

   

volume gains fuel surcharges and price improvements increased freight revenue from chemicals in 2011 versus 2010 in mid2010 we began moving crude oil shipments from the bakken formation in north dakota to facilities in louisiana this new business along with shipments from the eagle ford shale formation in south texas contributed to a 37 increase in shipments of petroleum products during 2011 strong domestic demand and robust spring planting increased fertilizer shipments by 9 versus 2010 additionally improving market conditions increased demand for industrial chemicals during 2011 driving volume levels up versus 2010 

 

 core pricing gains higher fuel surcharges and increased volume grew coal freight revenue in 2011 versus 2010 levels shipments of coal from the sprb were up 5 in 2011 compared to 2010 reflecting new business to wisconsin facilities and the startup of a new power plant near waco texas completion of a yearlong equipment relocation process at one of the mines in the third quarter of 2011 and minimal production problems elsewhere improved shipments from colorado and utah by 3 in 2011 versus 2010 these gains along with increased exports to europe and asia offset first half production problems and weak demand from eastern coal utilities 

 

   

 mexico business – each of our commodity groups includes revenue from shipments to and from mexico revenue from mexico business increased 8 to 19 billion in 2012 versus 2011 volume levels for four of the six commodity groups industrial products and agricultural products declined were up 5 in aggregate versus 2011 with particularly strong growth in automotive and intermodal shipments 

revenue from mexico business increased 16 to 18 billion in 2011 versus 2010 volume levels increased 9 in aggregate versus 2010 with particularly strong growth in automotive and industrial products coal was the one commodity group that declined as one of our customers conducted a supplier contract renewal during the year shifting transportation modes from rail to truck during the process 

  

operating expenses 

 

  

 compensation and benefits – compensation and benefits include wages payroll taxes health and welfare costs pension costs other postretirement benefits and incentive costs expenses in 2012 were essentially flat versus 2011 as operational improvements and cost reductions offset general wage and benefit inflation and higher pension and other postretirement benefits in addition weather related costs increased these expenses in 2011 

a combination of general wage and benefit inflation volumerelated expenses higher training costs associated with new hires additional crew costs due to speed restrictions caused by the midwest flooding and heat and drought in the south and higher pension expense drove the increase during 2011 compared to 2010 

fuel – fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and nonhighway vehicles and heavy equipment higher locomotive diesel fuel prices which averaged 322 per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in 2012 compared to 312 in 2011 increased expenses by 105 million volume as measured by gross tonmiles decreased 2 in 2012 versus 2011 driving expense down the fuel consumption rate was flat yearoveryear 

higher locomotive diesel fuel prices which averaged 312 including taxes and transportation costs in 2011 compared to 229 per gallon in 2010 increased expenses by 922 million in addition higher gasoline prices for highway and nonhighway vehicles also increased yearoveryear volume as measured by gross tonmiles increased 5 in 2011 versus 2010 driving expense up by 122 million 

purchased services and materials – expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors and other service providers including equipment 

  

maintenance and contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services materials used to maintain the railroad’s lines structures and equipment costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other railroads transportation and lodging for train crew employees trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers leased automobile maintenance expenses and tools and supplies expenses for contract services increased 103 million in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to increased demand for transportation services purchased by our logistics subsidiaries for their customers and additional costs for repair and maintenance of locomotives and freight cars 

expenses for contract services increased 106 million in 2011 versus 2010 driven by volumerelated external transportation services incurred by our subsidiaries and various other types of contractual services including floodrelated repairs mitigation and improvements volumerelated crew transportation and lodging costs as well as expenses associated with jointly owned operating facilities also increased costs compared to 2010 in addition an increase in locomotive maintenance materials used to prepare a portion of our locomotive fleet for return to active service due to increased volume and additional capacity for weather related issues and warranty expirations increased expenses in 2011 

depreciation – the majority of depreciation relates to road property including rail ties ballast and other track material a higher depreciable asset base reflecting ongoing capital spending increased depreciation expense in 2012 compared to 2011 

a higher depreciable asset base reflecting ongoing capital spending increased depreciation expense in 2011 compared to 2010 higher depreciation rates for rail and other track material also contributed to the increase the higher rates which became effective january 1 2011 resulted primarily from increased track usage based on higher gross tonmiles in 2010 

equipment and other rents – equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies freight car intermodal and locomotive leases and office and other rent expenses increased automotive and intermodal shipments partially offset by improved carcycle times drove an increase in our shortterm freight car rental expense in 2012 conversely lower locomotive lease expense partially offset the higher freight car rental expense 

costs increased in 2011 versus 2010 as higher shortterm freight car rental expense and container lease expense offset lower freight car and locomotive lease expense 

other – other expenses include personal injury freight and property damage destruction of equipment insurance environmental bad debt state and local taxes utilities telephone and cellular employee travel computer software and other general expenses other costs in 2012 were slightly higher than 2011 primarily due to higher property taxes despite continual improvement in our safety experience and lower estimated annual costs personal injury expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 as the liability reduction resulting from historical claim experience was less than the reduction in 2011 

higher property taxes casualty costs associated with destroyed equipment damaged freight and property and environmental costs increased other costs in 2011 compared to 2010 a onetime payment of 45 million in the first quarter of 2010 related to a transaction with csxi and continued improvement in our safety performance and lower estimated liability for personal injury which reduced our personal injury expense yearoveryear partially offset increases in other costs 

nonoperating items 

 

 other income – other income decreased in 2012 versus 2011 due to lower gains from real estate sales and higher environmental costs associated with nonoperating properties partially offset by an interest payment from a tax refund 

  

other income increased in 2011 versus 2010 due to higher gains from real estate sales lower environmental costs associated with nonoperating properties and the comparative impact of premiums paid for early redemption of longterm debt in the first quarter of 2010 

interest expense – interest expense decreased in 2012 versus 2011 reflecting a lower effective interest rate in 2012 of 60 versus 62 in 2011 as the debt level did not materially change in 2012 

interest expense decreased in 2011 versus 2010 due to a lower weightedaverage debt level of 92 billion versus 97 billion the effective interest rate was 62 in both 2011 and 2010 

income taxes – higher pretax income increased income taxes in 2012 compared to 2011 our effective tax rate for 2012 was relatively flat at 376 compared to 375 in 2011 

income taxes were higher in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily driven by higher pretax income our effective tax rate remained relatively flat at 375 in 2011 compared to 373 in 2010 

other operatingperformance and financial statistics 

we report key performance measures weekly to the association of american railroads aar including carloads average daily inventory of freight cars on our system average train speed and average terminal dwell time we provide this data on our website at wwwupcominvestorsreportsindexshtml 

operatingperformance statistics 

railroad performance measures reported to the aar as well as other performance measures are included in the table below 

 

 average train speed – average train speed is calculated by dividing train miles by hours operated on our main lines between terminals average train speed as reported to the association of american railroads aar increased 4 in 2012 versus 2011 efficient operations and relatively mild weather conditions during the year compared favorably to 2011 during which severe winter weather flooding and extreme heat and drought affected various parts of our network we continued operating a fluid and efficient network while handling essentially the same volume and adjusting operations to accommodate increased capital project work on our network compared to 2011 the extreme weather challenges in addition to increased carloadings and traffic mix changes led to a 2 decrease in average train speed in 2011 compared to 2010 

average terminal dwell time – average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our terminals lower average terminal dwell time improves asset utilization and service average terminal dwell time remained flat in 2012 compared to 2011 despite a shift in traffic mix to more manifest shipments which require more switching at terminals average terminal dwell time increased 3 in 2011 compared to 2010 additional volume weather challenges track replacement programs and a shift of traffic mix to more manifest shipments which require additional terminal processing all contributed to the increase 

average rail car inventory – average rail car inventory is the daily average number of rail cars on our lines including rail cars in storage lower average rail car inventory reduces congestion in our yards and sidings which increases train speed reduces average terminal dwell time and improves rail car utilization despite a shift in traffic mix from coal to shalerelated and automotive shipments with longer 

  

cycle times productivity improvements reduced average rail car inventory by 1 in 2012 compared to 2011 average rail car inventory decreased slightly in 2011 compared to 2010 as we continued to adjust the size of our freight car fleet 

gross and revenue tonmiles – gross tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled revenue tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles gross tonmiles declined 2 in 2012 compared to 2011 while revenue tonmiles decreased 4 and carloads remained relatively flat changes in commodity mix drove the yearoveryear variances between gross tonmiles revenue tonmiles and carloads gross and revenuetonmiles increased 5 in 2011 compared to 2010 driven by a 3 increase in carloads and mix changes to heavier commodity groups notably a 5 increase in coal shipments 

operating ratio – operating ratio is our operating expenses reflected as a percentage of operating revenue our operating ratio improved 29 points to a record low of 678 in 2012 versus 2011 core pricing gains improved fuel recovery provisions efficient operations and cost reductions more than offset the impact of inflationary pressures our operating ratio increased 01 points to 707 in 2011 versus 2010 higher fuel prices inflation and weather related costs partially offset by core pricing gains and productivity initiatives drove the increase 

employees – employee levels increased 2 in 2012 versus 2011 work related to the increase in capital investment including positive train control accounted for over half of the increase additionally the shift in our traffic mix required more resources in the southern region to support the growth in shalerelated shipments employee levels were up 5 in 2011 versus 2010 driven by a 3 increase in volume levels a higher number of trainmen engineers and yard employees receiving training during the year and increased work on capital projects 

customer satisfaction index – our customer satisfaction survey asks customers to rate how satisfied they are with our performance over the last 12 months on a variety of attributes a higher score indicates higher customer satisfaction we believe that improvement in survey results in 2012 generally reflects customer recognition of our service quality supported by our capital investment program 

return on average common shareholders’ equity 

 

 return on invested capital as adjusted roic 

 

 roic is considered a nongaap financial measure by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe this measure is important in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our longterm capital investments in addition we currently use roic as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of equity compensation for our executives roic should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute 

  

for other information provided in accordance with gaap the most comparable gaap measure is return on average common shareholders’ equity the tables on the previous page provide reconciliations from return on average common shareholders’ equity to roic our 2012 roic improved 16 points compared to 2011 primarily as a result of higher earnings 

debt to capital  adjusted debt to capital 

 

 adjusted debt to capital is a nongaap financial measure under sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the total amount of leverage in our capital structure including offbalance sheet lease obligations which we generally incur in connection with financing the acquisition of locomotives and freight cars and certain facilities operating leases were discounted using 60 and 62 at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the discount rate reflects our effective interest rate we monitor the ratio of adjusted debt to capital as we manage our capital structure to balance costeffective and efficient access to the capital markets with our overall cost of capital adjusted debt to capital should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for debt to capital the tables above provide reconciliations from debt to capital to adjusted debt to capital our december 31 2012 debt to capital ratios decreased as a result of a 13 billion increase in equity from december 31 2011 driven by higher earnings 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2012 our principal sources of liquidity included cash cash equivalents our receivables securitization facility and our revolving credit facility as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets we had 18 billion of committed credit available under our credit facility with no borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2012 we did not make any borrowings under this facility during 2012 the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the 600 million capacity receivables securitization facility was 100 million as of december 31 2012 and is included in our consolidated statements of financial position as debt due after one year the receivables securitization facility obligates us to maintain an investment grade bond rating if our bond rating were to deteriorate it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financings is dependent on market conditions deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability we expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity through any or all of the following sources or activities i increasing the utilization of our receivables securitization ii issuing commercial paper iii entering into bank loans outside of our revolving credit facility or iv issuing bonds or other debt securities to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets the company’s 18 billion revolving credit facility is intended to back union pacific’s ability to issue commercial paper and is an emergency backup source of liquidity the company has no current intentions of borrowing under this facility 

  

at december 31 2012 and 2011 we had a working capital surplus this reflects a strong cash position which provides enhanced liquidity in an uncertain economic environment in addition we believe we have adequate access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

 

 operating activities 

higher net income in 2012 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2011 partially offset by lower tax benefits from bonus depreciation as explained below and payments for past wages based on national labor negotiations settled earlier this year 

higher net income and lower cash income tax payments in 2011 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2010 the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 2010 provided for 100 bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2011 and 50 bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2012 as a result of the act the company deferred a substantial portion of its 2011 income tax expense this deferral decreased 2011 income tax payments thereby contributing to the positive operating cash flow in future years however additional cash will be used to pay income taxes that were previously deferred in addition the adoption of a new accounting standard in january of 2010 changed the accounting treatment for our receivables securitization facility from a sale of undivided interests recorded as an operating activity to a secured borrowing recorded as a financing activity which decreased cash provided by operating activities by 400 million in 2010 

investing activities 

higher capital investments in 2012 drove the increase in cash used in investing activities compared to 2011 included in capital investments in 2012 was 75 million for the early buyout of 165 locomotives under longterm operating and capital leases during the first quarter of 2012 which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions 

higher capital investments partially offset by higher proceeds from asset sales in 2011 drove the increase in cash used in investing activities compared to 2010 

  

the tables below detail cash capital investments and track statistics for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

 capital plan – in 2013 we expect our total capital investments to be approximately 36 billion which may be revised if business conditions warrant or if new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments we expect to use over 60 of our 2013 capital investments to replace and improve existing capital assets among our major investment categories are replacing and improving track infrastructure upgrading our locomotive and freight car fleet including acquisition of 100 locomotives and 900 freight cars primarily large covered hoppers gondolas auto racks and refrigerated box cars improving technology including investing in ptc and other capital projects additionally we will continue increasing our network and terminal capacity for example to balance terminal capacity with more mainline capacity from our track expansion in the southern region we are constructing a rail facility at santa teresa new mexico that initially will include a runthrough and fueling facility and an intermodal ramp 

we expect to fund our 2013 cash capital investments by using some or all of the following cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and cash on hand our annual capital plan is a critical component of our longterm strategic plan which we expect will enhance the longterm value of the corporation for our shareholders by providing sufficient resources to i replace and improve our existing track infrastructure to provide safe and fluid operations ii increase network efficiency by adding or improving facilities and track and iii make investments that meet customer demand and take advantage of opportunities for longterm growth 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities increased in 2012 versus 2011 dividend payments increased by 309 million reflecting our higher dividend rate and common stock repurchases increased by 56 million our debt levels did not materially change from last year after a decline in debt levels from 2010 therefore less cash was used in 2012 for debt activity than in 2011 

cash used in financing activities increased in 2011 versus 2010 higher dividend payments in 2011 of 837 million compared to 602 million in 2010 reflecting our increased dividend rate and the repurchase of 14 billion of our common stock a 169 million increase from 2010 repurchases drove the increase we used less cash to reduce outstanding debt in 2011 which partially offset this increase 

  

credit facilities – on december 31 2012 we had 18 billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility the facility which is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper we did not draw on the facility during 2012 commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investmentgrade borrowers the facility allows for borrowings at floating rates based on london interbank offered rates plus a spread depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings the facility matures in 2015 under a four year term and requires the corporation to maintain a debttonetworth coverage ratio as a condition to making a borrowing at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 and at all times during the year we were in compliance with this covenant 

the definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the debttonetworth coverage ratio includes among other things certain credit arrangements capital leases guarantees and unfunded and vested pension benefits under title iv of erisa at december 31 2012 the debttonetworth coverage ratio allowed us to carry up to 398 billion of debt as defined in the facility and we had 96 billion of debt as defined in the facility outstanding at that date under our current capital plans we expect to continue to satisfy the debttonetworth coverage ratio however many factors beyond our reasonable control could affect our ability to comply with this provision in the future the facility does not include any other financial restrictions credit rating triggers other than ratingdependent pricing or any other provision that could require us to post collateral the facility also includes a 75 million crossdefault provision and a changeofcontrol provision 

during 2012 we issued and repaid commercial paper of 50 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 we had no commercial paper outstanding our revolving credit facility supports our outstanding commercial paper balances and unless we change the terms of our commercial paper program our aggregate issuance of commercial paper will not exceed the amount of borrowings available under the facility 

at december 31 2012 and 2011 we reclassified as longterm debt 100 million of debt due within one year that we intend to refinance this reclassification reflected our ability and intent to refinance any shortterm borrowings and certain current maturities of longterm debt on a longterm basis 

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

for each of the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 104 84 and 69 respectively the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis earnings represent income from continuing operations less equity earnings net of distributions plus fixed charges and income taxes fixed charges represent interest charges amortization of debt discount and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges see exhibit 12 to this report for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

common shareholders’ equity 

dividend restrictions – our revolving credit facility includes a debttonet worth covenant discussed in the credit facilities section above that under certain circumstances restricts the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders the amount of retained earnings available for dividends was 151 billion and 138 billion at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

  

share repurchase program 

effective april 1 2011 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of 40 million shares of our common stock by march 31 2014 replacing our previous repurchase program as of december 31 2012 we repurchased a total of 71 billion of our common stock since the commencement of our repurchase programs the table below represents shares repurchased under the new repurchase program except for the first quarter of 2011 which represent shares repurchased under the previous program 

 

 management’s assessments of market conditions and other pertinent facts guide the timing and volume of all repurchases we expect to fund any share repurchases under this program through cash generated from operations the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties debt issuances and cash on hand repurchased shares are recorded in treasury stock at cost which includes any applicable commissions and fees 

shelf registration statement and significant new borrowings – under our current shelf registration we may issue from time to time any combination of debt securities preferred stock common stock or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings we have no immediate plans to issue equity securities however we will continue to explore opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under our shelf registration and therefore we may issue additional debt securities at any time 

during 2012 we issued the following unsecured fixedrate debt securities under our current shelf registration 

 

 we used the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes including the repurchase of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program these debt securities include changeofcontrol provisions at december 31 2012 we had remaining authority to issue up to 14 billion of debt securities under our shelf registration 

on may 22 2012 we borrowed 100 million under a 4yearterm loan the loan the loan has a floating rate based on london interbank offered rates plus a spread and is prepayable in whole or in part without a premium prior to maturity the agreement documenting the loan has provisions similar to our revolving credit facility including identical debttonetworth covenant and change of control provisions and similar customary default provisions the agreement does not include any other financial restrictions credit rating triggers or any other provision that would require us to post collateral 

during the third and fourth quarters of 2012 we acquired 343 locomotives by exercising early buyout rights in certain operating and capital lease agreements following the acquisition of the locomotives we sold them to financing parties and entered into capital lease financing agreements with these parties we did not recognize any gains or losses as a result of these transactions capital lease obligations totaling 286 million are reported in our consolidated statements of financial position as debt at december 31 2012 

  

debt exchange – on june 23 2011 we exchanged 857 million of various outstanding notes and debentures due between 2013 and 2019 existing notes for 750 million of 4163 notes new notes due july 15 2022 plus cash consideration of approximately 267 million and 17 million for accrued and unpaid interest on the existing notes in accordance with the accounting standards codification asc 4705040 debtmodifications and extinguishmentsderecognition this transaction was accounted for as a debt exchange as the exchanged debt instruments are not considered to be substantially different the cash consideration was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of debt and the balance of the unamortized discount and issue costs from the existing notes is being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the term of the new notes no gain or loss was recognized as a result of the exchange costs related to the debt exchange that were payable to parties other than the debt holders totaled approximately 6 million and were included in interest expense during the three months ended june 30 2011 

the following table lists the outstanding notes and debentures that were exchanged 

 

 debt redemptions – on november 30 2012 we redeemed all 450 million of our outstanding 545 notes due january 31 2013 the redemption resulted in an early extinguishment charge of 4 million 

on april 28 2012 we redeemed all 100 million of our outstanding 570 tooele county utah hazardous waste treatment revenue bonds due november 1 2026 the redemption resulted in an early extinguishment charge of 2 million in the second quarter of 2012 

on december 19 2011 we redeemed the remaining 175 million of our 65 notes due april 15 2012 and all 300 million of our outstanding 6125 notes due january 15 2012 the redemptions resulted in an early extinguishment charge of 5 million 

on march 22 2010 we redeemed 175 million of our 65 notes due april 15 2012 the redemption resulted in an early extinguishment charge of 16 million in the first quarter of 2010 

on november 1 2010 we redeemed all 400 million of our outstanding 665 notes due january 15 2011 the redemption resulted in a 5 million early extinguishment charge 

receivables securitization facility – under the receivables securitization facility the railroad sells most of its accounts receivable to union pacific receivables inc upri a whollyowned bankruptcyremote subsidiary upri may subsequently transfer without recourse on a 364day revolving basis an undivided interest in eligible accounts receivable to investors the total capacity to transfer undivided interests to investors under the facility was 600 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the facility was 100 million at both december 31 2012 and 2011 the value of the undivided interest held by investors was supported by 11 billion of accounts receivable at both december 31 2012 and 2011 at both december 31 2012 and 2011 the value of the interest retained by upri was 11 billion this retained interest is included in accounts receivable net in our consolidated statements of financial position 

the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors could fluctuate based upon the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks including default and dilution if default or dilution ratios increase one percent the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would not change as of december 31 2012 should our 

  

credit rating fall below investment grade the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would be reduced and in certain cases the investors would have the right to discontinue the facility 

the railroad collected approximately 201 billion and 188 billion of receivables during the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively upri used certain of these proceeds to purchase new receivables under the facility 

the costs of the receivables securitization facility include interest which will vary based on prevailing commercial paper rates program fees paid to banks commercial paper issuing costs and fees for unused commitment availability the costs of the receivables securitization facility are included in interest expense and were 3 million 4 million and 6 million for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

the investors have no recourse to the railroad’s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims creditors of the railroad do not have recourse to the assets of upri 

in july 2012 the receivables securitization facility was renewed for an additional 364day period at comparable terms and conditions 

subsequent event – on january 2 2013 we transferred an additional 300 million in undivided interest to investors under the receivables securitization facility increasing the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors from 100 million to 400 million 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and as referenced in the tables below we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments including material sources of offbalance sheet and structured finance arrangements other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets as described in item 1a of part ii of this report there is no known trend demand commitment event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition our commercial obligations financings and commitments are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations particularly within the transportation industry 

the following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of december 31 2012 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

guarantees – at december 31 2012 we were contingently liable for 307 million in guarantees we have recorded a liability of 2 million for the fair value of these obligations as of december 31 2012 and 2011 we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business and they include guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building equipment financings and affiliated operations the final guarantee expires in 2022 we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

other matters 

labor agreements – approximately 86 of our 45928 fulltimeequivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions during the year we concluded the most recent round of negotiations which began in 2010 with the ratification of new agreements by several unions that continued negotiating into 2012 all of the unions executed similar multiyear agreements that provide for higher employee cost sharing of employee health and welfare benefits and higher wages the current agreements will remain in effect until renegotiated under provisions of the railway labor act the next round of negotiations will begin in early 2015 

inflation – long periods of inflation significantly increase asset replacement costs for capitalintensive companies as a result assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels depreciation charges on an inflationadjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 

derivative financial instruments – we may use derivative financial instruments in limited instances to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and fuel prices we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged both at inception and throughout the hedged period we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items at inception as well as our riskmanagement objectives strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness changes in the fair market value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are charged to earnings we may use swaps collars futures andor forward contracts to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in interest rates and fuel prices however the use of these derivative financial instruments may limit future benefits from favorable price movements 

market and credit risk – we address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item we manage credit risk related to derivative financial instruments which is minimal by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements at december 31 2012 and 2011 we were not required to provide collateral nor had we received collateral relating to our hedging activities 

  

determination of fair value – we determine the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or the present value of expected future cash flows 

sensitivity analyses – the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 

at december 31 2012 we had variablerate debt representing approximately 34 of our total debt if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2013 than our december 31 2012 variable rate which was approximately 11 our interest expense would increase by approximately 3 million this amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balances of our variablerate debt at december 31 2012 

market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2012 and amounts to an increase of approximately 1 billion to the fair value of our debt at december 31 2012 we estimated the fair values of our fixedrate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 

interest rate fair value hedges – we manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period we generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings we employ derivatives primarily swaps as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix in addition we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixedrate debt securities 

swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt’s fair value attributable to the changes in interest rates we account for swaps as fair value hedges using the shortcut method as allowed by the derivatives and hedging topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb asc therefore we do not record any ineffectiveness within our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2012 and 2011 we had no interest rate fair value hedges outstanding 

interest rate cash flow hedges – we report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affects earnings at december 31 2012 and 2011 we had reductions of 1 million and 2 million respectively recorded as an accumulated other comprehensive loss that is being amortized on a straightline basis through september 30 2014 as of december 31 2012 and 2011 we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding 

accounting pronouncements – on january 1 2012 we adopted 201105 comprehensive income topic 220 presentation of comprehensive income asu 201105 which requires presentation of the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements and eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders’ equity the standard does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified to net income also in december of 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201112 deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassification of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 201105 asu 201112 on february 5 2013 the fasb issued accounting standards update 201302 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which adds additional disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income this asu will be effective for the first interim reporting period in 2013 

asserted and unasserted claims – various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries we cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity however to the extent possible where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated we have recorded a liability we do not expect that any known lawsuits claims environmental costs commitments contingent liabilities or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our 

  

consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters 

indemnities  – our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements including certain tax indemnifications can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions 

climate change – although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item 1a of this report we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact however we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment including investments in new technologies using training programs to reduce fuel consumption and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 2 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 these critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 

personal injury – the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability including unasserted claims the federal employers’ liability act fela governs compensation for workrelated accidents under fela damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or outofcourt settlements we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 

our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value approximately 90 of the recorded liability is related to asserted claims and approximately 10 is related to unasserted claims at december 31 2012 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 334 million to 368 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation 

our personal injury liability activity was as follows 

 

   

our personal injury claims activity was as follows 

 

 asbestos – we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other parties allege exposure to asbestos we assess our potential liability using a statistical analysis of resolution costs for asbestosrelated claims this liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing costs the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions 

 

    our liability for asbestosrelated claims is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments approximately 22 of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 78 related to unasserted claims at december 31 2012 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestosrelated claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 139 million to 149 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other 

our asbestosrelated liability activity was as follows 

 

 in conjunction with the liability update performed in 2012 we also reassessed estimated insurance recoveries we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2012 and 2011 the amounts recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts however future events such as the number of new claims filed each year average settlement costs and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts estimates also may vary in the future if strategies activities and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change federal and state laws governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimants and there are material changes with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants 

  

environmental costs – we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations we have identified 284 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements this includes 32 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government 17 of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 

when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in our business we perform with assistance of our consultants environmental assessments on the property we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated we do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable at december 31 2012 none of our environmental liability was discounted while less than 1 of our environmental liability was discounted at 20 at december 31 2011 

our environmental liability activity was as follows 

 

 the environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties cost estimates are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and existing technology laws and regulations the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties sitespecific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal state and local laws governing environmental remediation current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

property and depreciation – our railroad operations are highly capital intensive and our large base of homogeneous networktype assets turns over on a continuous basis each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated service lives which are measured in years except for rail in highdensity traffic corridors ie all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment yard and switching tracks and electronic yards for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics use and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources not as singular items we currently have more than 60 depreciable 

  

asset classes and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology asset strategies or other factors 

we determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property by means of depreciation studies we perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets ie rail and other track material ties and ballast and other road property our depreciation studies take into account the following factors 

 

    for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track it has been our experience that the lives of rail in highdensity traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage ie the amount of weight carried over the rail the service lives also vary based on rail weight rail condition eg new or secondhand and rail type eg straight or curve our depreciation studies for rail in high density traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross tonmiles carried over the rail ie the weight of loaded and empty freight cars locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile rail in highdensity traffic corridors accounts for approximately 70 percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material based on the number of gross tonmiles carried over our rail in high density traffic corridors during 2012 the estimated service lives of the majority of this rail ranged from approximately 15 years to approximately 30 years for all other depreciable assets we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively 

estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to changes in physical use technology asset strategies and other factors that will have an impact on the retirement profiles of our assets we are not aware of any specific factors that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service lives of our assets actual use and retirement of our assets may vary from our current estimates which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future periods 

changes in estimated useful lives of our assets due to the results of our depreciation studies could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately 58 million if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were decreased by one year annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately 62 million our recent depreciation studies have resulted in changes in depreciation rates for some asset classes based on these changes depreciation expense will increase approximately 3 to 4 in 2013 versus 2012 

under group depreciation the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using i inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ii the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate in addition we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies any deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets 

for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions i is 

  

unusual ii is material in amount and iii varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies during the last three fiscal years no gains or losses were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad properties a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations 

income taxes – we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns these expected future tax consequences are measured based on current tax law the effects of future tax legislation are not anticipated future tax legislation such as a change in the corporate tax rate could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity for example a 1 increase in future income tax rates would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately 340 million 

when appropriate we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reflect that these tax assets may not be realized in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized based on management’s judgments using available evidence for purposes of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize a deferred tax asset in 2012 and 2011 there were no valuation allowances 

we recognize tax benefits that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement a liability for “unrecognized tax benefits” is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards 

pension and other postretirement benefits – we use an actuarial analysis to measure the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and medical and life insurance benefits opeb to eligible employees in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make several assumptions the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets for opeb the critical assumptions are the discount rate and health care cost trend rate 

we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually and selected assumptions are based on the following factors 

 

   the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit for 2012 and the estimated impact on 2012 net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit relative to a change in those assumptions 

 

   

the following table presents the net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit for the years ended december 31

the corporation’s management assessed the effectiveness of the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 in making this assessment it used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control – integrated framework based on our assessment management believes that as of december 31 2012 the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission

seasonality – some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons reflecting either or both the nature of the commodity such as certain agricultural and food products that have specific growing and harvesting seasons and the demand cycle for the commodity such as intermodal traffic which generally has a peak shipping season during the third quarter to meet holidayrelated demand for consumer goods during the fourth quarter the peak shipping seasons for these commodities can vary considerably from year to year depending upon various factors including the strength of domestic and international economies and currencies and the strength of harvests and market prices for agricultural products in response to an annual request delivered by the surface transportation board stb of the us department of transportation dot to all of the class i railroads operating in the us we issue a publicly available letter during the third quarter detailing our plans for handling traffic during the third and fourth quarters and providing other information requested by the stb 

working capital – at december 31 2011 and 2010 we had a working capital surplus this reflects a strong cash position which provides enhanced liquidity in an uncertain economic environment in addition we believe we have adequate access to capital markets to meet cash requirements and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

competition – we are subject to competition from other railroads motor carriers ship and barge operators and pipelines our main rail competitor is burlington northern santa fe corporation its rail subsidiary bnsf railway company bnsf operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors in addition we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers motor carrier competition exists for five of our six commodity groups excluding energy because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and gulf coast waterways barges can be particularly competitive especially for grain and bulk commodities in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service while we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation or legislation releasing motor carriers from their size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

key suppliers – we depend on two key domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives due to the capital intensive nature of the locomotive manufacturing business and sophistication of this equipment potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry in this industry therefore if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives for any reason including insolvency or bankruptcy we could experience a significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations additionally for a high percentage of our rail purchases we utilize two suppliers one domestic and one international that meet our specifications rail is critical for both maintenance of our network and replacement and improvement or expansion of our network and facilities rail manufacturing also has high barriers to entry and if one of those suppliers discontinues operations for any reason including insolvency or bankruptcy we could experience cost increases and difficulty obtaining rail

railroad security – operating a safe and secure railroad is first among our critical priorities and is a primary responsibility of all our employees this emphasis helps us protect the public our employees our customers and operations across our rail network our security efforts rely upon a wide variety of measures including employee training cooperation with our customers training of emergency responders and partnerships with numerous federal state and local government agencies while federal law requires us to protect the confidentiality of our security plans designed to safeguard against terrorism and other security incidents the following provides a general overview of our security initiatives 

uprr security measures – we maintain a comprehensive security plan designed to both deter and to respond to any potential or actual threats as they arise the plan includes four levels of alert status each with its own set of countermeasures we employ our own police force consisting of more than 215 commissioned and highlytrained officers our employees also undergo recurrent security and preparedness training as well as federallymandated hazardous materials and security training we regularly review the sufficiency of our employee training programs to identify ways to increase preparedness and to improve security we maintain the capability to move critical operations to backup facilities in different locations 

we have an emergency response management center which operates 24 hours a day the center receives reports of emergencies dangerous or potentially dangerous conditions and other safety and security issues from our employees the public and law enforcement and other government officials in cooperation with government officials we monitor both threats and public events and as necessary we may alter rail traffic flow at times of concern to minimize risk to communities we serve and our operations we comply with the hazardous materials routing rules and other requirements imposed by federal law we also design our operating plan to expedite the movement of hazardous material shipments to minimize the time rail cars remain idle at yards and terminals located in or near major population centers additionally in compliance with new transportation security agency regulations that took effect on april 1 2009 we deployed new information systems and instructed employees in tracking and documenting the handoff of rail security sensitive material with customers and interchange partners 

we also have established a number of our own innovative safety and securityoriented initiatives ranging from various investments in technology to the officer on the train program which provides local law enforcement officers with the opportunity to ride with train crews to enhance their understanding of railroad operations and risks our staff of information security professionals continually assesses cyber security risks and implements mitigation programs that evolve with the changing technology threat environment 

cooperation with federal state and local government agencies – we work closely on physical and cyber security initiatives with government agencies ranging from the dot and the department of homeland security dhs to local police departments fire departments and other first responders in conjunction with dot dhs and other railroads we sponsor operation respond which provides first responders with secure links to electronic railroad resources including mapping systems shipment records and other essential information required by emergency personnel to respond to accidents and other situations we also participate in the national joint terrorism task force a multiagency effort established by the us department of justice and the federal bureau of investigation to combat and prevent terrorism 

  

we work with the coast guard us customs and border protection cbp and the military transport management command to monitor shipments entering the uprr rail network at us border crossings and ports we were the first railroad in the us to be named a partner in cbp’s customstrade partnership against terrorism a partnership designed to develop enhance and maintain effective security processes throughout the global supply chain 

cooperation with customers and trade associations – along with other railroads we work with the american chemistry council to train more than 200000 emergency responders each year we work closely with our chemical shippers to establish plant security plans and we continue to take steps to more closely monitor and track hazardous materials shipments in cooperation with the federal railroad administration fra and other railroads we are also working to develop additional improvements to tank car design that will further limit the risk of releases of hazardous materials 

governmental and environmental regulation

the operations of the railroad are also subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the stb the stb has jurisdiction over rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic common carrier service of regulated traffic freight car compensation transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines and acquisition of control of rail common carriers the stb launched wideranging proceedings to explore whether to expand rail regulation and we actively participated the stb has not yet taken further action and denied a petition seeking one form of “access” regulation additionally several bills were introduced in the us senate in early 2011 that would expand the regulatory authority of the stb and could include new antitrust provisions we continue to monitor these proposed bills 

the operations of the railroad also are subject to the regulations of the fra and other federal and state agencies on january 12 2010 the fra issued final rules governing installation of positive train control ptc by the end of 2015 although still under development ptc is a collision avoidance technology intended to override locomotive controls and stop a train before an accident the fra acknowledged that projected costs will exceed projected benefits by a ratio of about 22 to one and we estimate that our costs will be higher than the fra assumed congress has directed the fra to provide an early report by march 1 2012 on the status of ptc implementation which is in advance of a detailed report due by the end of 2012 through 2011 we have invested nearly 400 million in the development of ptc 

dot the occupational safety and health administration and dhs along with other federal agencies have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety movement of hazardous materials and hazardous waste emissions requirements and equipment standards the rail safety improvement act of 2008 among other things revised hours of service rules for train and certain other railroad employees mandated implementation of ptc imposed passenger service requirements addressed safety at rail crossings increased the number of safety related employees of the fra and increased fines that may be levied against railroads for safety violations additionally various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law

we must manage fluctuating demand for our services and network capacity – if there is significant demand for our services that exceeds the designed capacity of our network we may experience network difficulties including congestion and reduced velocity that could compromise the level of service we provide to our customers this level of demand may also compound the impact of weather and weatherrelated events on our operations and velocity although we continue to improve our transportation plan add capacity and improve operations at our yards and other facilities we cannot be sure that these measures will fully or adequately address any service shortcomings resulting from demand exceeding our planned capacity we may experience other operational or service difficulties related to network capacity dramatic and unplanned increases or decreases of demand for rail service with respect to one or more of our commodity groups or other events that could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in the event that we experience significant reductions of demand for rail services with respect to one or more of our commodity groups we may experience increased costs associated with resizing our operations including higher unit operating costs and costs for the storage of locomotives rail cars and other equipment workforce adjustments and other related activities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to significant governmental regulation – we are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal state and local authorities covering a variety of health safety labor environmental economic as discussed below and other matters many laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses permits and other authorizations and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us governments or regulators may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate without providing us any recourse to address any adverse effects on our business including without limitation regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution business relationships with other railroads calculation of our cost of capital or other inputs relevant to computing our revenue adequacy the prices we charge and costs and expenses significant legislative activity in congress or regulatory activity by the stb could expand regulation of railroad operations and prices for rail services which could reduce capital spending on our rail network facilities and equipment and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity as part of the rail safety improvement act of 2008 railroad carriers must implement ptc by the end of 2015 which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make other capital investments one or more consolidations of class i railroads could also lead to increased regulation of the rail industry 

we are required to transport hazardous materials – federal laws require railroads including us to transport certain hazardous materials regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss any rail accident or other incident or accident on our network at our facilities or at the facilities of our customers involving the release of hazardous materials including toxic inhalation hazard or tih materials such as chlorine could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury property damage and environmental penalties and remediation which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we may be affected by general economic conditions – prolonged severe adverse domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of financial and credit markets including the availability of short and longterm debt financing may affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry and may have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity and our results of operations and financial condition 

we face competition from other railroads and other transportation providers – we face competition from other railroads motor carriers ships barges and pipelines in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service while we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation or legislation releasing motor carriers from their size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition 

  

and liquidity additionally any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect the competitive environment in which we operate 

we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations – we rely on information technology in all aspects of our business if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if we are unable to develop or implement new technology such as ptc or the latest version of our transportation control systems we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally if a cyber attack or other event causes significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment we could suffer a significant service interruption safety failure security breach or other operational difficulties which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations as the majority of our employees belong to labor unions and labor agreements – the us class i railroads are party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in among other things strikes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts which could cause a significant disruption of our operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could compromise our service reliability or significantly increase our costs for health care wages and other benefits which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures – as a railroad with a vast network we are exposed to severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods mudslides or landslides extreme temperatures and significant precipitation that may cause business interruptions including line outages on our rail network that can adversely affect our entire rail network and result in increased costs increased liabilities and decreased revenue which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures – as a railroad with operations in densely populated urban areas and other cities and a vast rail network we are exposed to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage environmental liability and other matters any material changes to litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving any or all of property damage personal injury and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to significant environmental laws and regulations – due to the nature of the railroad business our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waters handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and hazardous material or petroleum releases we generate and transport hazardous and nonhazardous waste in our operations and we did so in our former operations environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties leased properties and properties owned by third parties as well as to properties we currently own environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation we have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated or are strictly liable under these laws or regulations we could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we may be affected by climate change and market or regulatory responses to climate change – climate change including the impact of global warming could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gasses including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating costs restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that a use commodities that we carry to produce energy b use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we 

  

carry or c manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels including chemical producers farmers and food producers and automakers and other manufacturers significant cost increases government regulation or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns including for example the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers finally we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change any of these factors individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

the availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations – changes in demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to meet demand for rail service unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

rising or elevated fuel costs and whether we are able to mitigate these costs with fuel surcharges could materially and adversely affect our business – fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses diesel fuel prices are subject to dramatic fluctuations and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results although we currently are able to recover a significant amount of our increased fuel expenses through revenue from fuel surcharges we cannot be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elevated fuel costs through surcharges future market conditions or legislative or regulatory activities could adversely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharges or adequately recover increased fuel costs through fuel surcharges international political and economic circumstances affect fuel prices and supplies weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity if a fuel supply shortage were to arise higher fuel prices could despite our fuel surcharge programs have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we utilize capital markets – due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements we utilize longterm debt instruments bank financing and commercial paper from timetotime and we pledge certain of our receivables significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets including the credit markets or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to and significantly increase the cost of commercial paper and other financing sources including bank credit facilities and the issuance of longterm debt including corporate bonds a deterioration of our financial condition could result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade which could prohibit or restrict us from utilizing our current receivables securitization facility or accessing external sources of short and longterm debt financing and significantly increase the costs associated with utilizing the receivables securitization facility and issuing both commercial paper and longterm debt 

we are subject to legislative regulatory and legal developments involving taxes – taxes are a significant part of our expenses we are subject to us federal state and foreign income payroll property sales and use fuel and other types of taxes changes in tax rates enactment of new tax laws revisions of tax regulations and claims or litigation with taxing authorities could result in substantially higher taxes and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are dependent on certain key suppliers of locomotives and rail – due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry therefore if one of the domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives discontinues manufacturing locomotives for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience significant cost increases and reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary for our operations additionally for a high percentage of our rail purchases we utilize two suppliers one domestic and one international 

  

that meet our specifications rail is critical to our operations for rail replacement programs maintenance and for adding additional network capacity new rail and storage yards and expansions of existing facilities this industry similarly has high barriers to entry and if one of these suppliers discontinues operations for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience both significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail for maintenance and other projects 

we may be affected by acts of terrorism war or risk of war – our rail lines facilities and equipment including rail cars carrying hazardous materials could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks terrorist attacks or other similar events any government response thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in addition insurance premiums for some or all of our current coverages could increase dramatically or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future

as a result of the merger of missouri pacific railroad company mprr with and into uprr on january 1 1997 and pursuant to the underlying indentures for the mprr mortgage bonds uprr must maintain the same value of assets after the merger in order to comply with the security requirements of the mortgage bonds as of the merger date the value of the mprr assets that secured the mortgage bonds was approximately 60 billion in accordance with the terms of the indentures this collateral value must be maintained during the entire term of the mortgage bonds irrespective of the outstanding balance of such bonds 

environmental matters – certain of our properties are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment see discussion of environmental issues in business – governmental and environmental regulation item 1 and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies – environmental item 7 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation that occur in connection with our business we routinely assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest available information and when necessary we seek input from our thirdparty advisors when making these assessments consistent with sec rules and requirements we describe below material pending legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities other proceedings arising under federal state or local environmental laws and regulations including governmental proceedings involving potential fines penalties or other monetary sanctions in excess of 100000 and such other pending matters that we may determine to be appropriate 

environmental matters 

as we reported in our annual report on form 10k for 2005 the illinois attorney general’s office filed a complaint against the railroad in the circuit court for the twentieth judicial circuit st clair county for injunctive and other relief on november 28 2005 alleging a diesel fuel spill from an aboveground storage tank in a rail yard in dupo st clair county illinois the state of illinois seeks to enjoin uprr from further violations and a monetary penalty union pacific settled this matter by paying the state of illinois 34000 

as we reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended march 31 2010 we received notices from epa region 8 and us department of justice doj alleging that we may be liable under federal environmental laws for violating the clean water act and the oil pollution prevention act relating to derailments and spills and uprr’s spill prevention countermeasure and control plans and its stormwater pollution prevention plans in colorado utah and wyoming we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings because we are continuing to investigate and negotiate with the epa region 8 and doj the amount of the proposed penalty although uncertain could exceed 100000 

we received notices from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are or may be liable under federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the us 

  

including sites on the superfund national priorities list or state superfund lists we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings and suits because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs 

information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies – environmental item 7 

other matters 

antitrust litigation – as we reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2007 20 small rail shippers many of whom are represented by the same law firms filed virtually identical antitrust lawsuits in various federal district courts against the railroad and four other class i railroads in the us one railroad was eventually dropped from the lawsuit the original plaintiff filed the first of these claims in the us district court in new jersey on may 14 2007 and the additional plaintiffs filed claims in district courts in various states including florida illinois alabama pennsylvania and the district of columbia these suits allege that the named railroads engaged in pricefixing by establishing common fuel surcharges for certain rail traffic 

we received additional complaints following the initial claim increasing the total number of complaints to 30 in addition to suits filed by direct purchasers of rail transportation a few of the suits involved plaintiffs alleging that they are or were indirect purchasers of rail transportation and seeking to represent a purported class of indirect purchasers of rail transportation that paid fuel surcharges these complaints added allegations under state antitrust and consumer protection laws on november 6 2007 the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation ordered that all of the rail fuel surcharge cases be transferred to judge paul friedman of the us district court in the district of columbia for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings subsequently the direct purchaser plaintiffs and the indirect purchaser plaintiffs filed consolidated amended class action complaints against uprr and three other class i railroads 

one additional shipper filed a separate antitrust suit during 2008 subsequently the shipper voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice 

on october 10 2008 judge friedman heard oral arguments with respect to the defendant railroads’ motions to dismiss in a ruling on november 7 2008 judge friedman denied the motion with respect to the direct purchasers’ complaint and pretrial proceedings are underway in that case the status of which is described below on december 31 2008 judge friedman dismissed the complaints of the indirect purchasers based upon state antitrust consumer protection and unjust enrichment laws he also ruled however that these plaintiffs could proceed with their claim for injunctive relief under the federal antitrust laws which is identical to a claim by the direct purchaser plaintiffs the indirect purchasers appealed judge friedman’s ruling to the us court of appeals for the district of columbia on april 16 2010 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia affirmed judge friedman’s ruling dismissing the indirect purchasers’ claims based on various state laws on december 13 2010 the us supreme court denied the indirect purchaser plaintiffs’ petition for certiorari 

with respect to the direct purchasers’ complaint judge friedman conducted a twoday hearing on october 6 and 7 2010 on the class certification issue and the railroad defendants’ motion to exclude evidence of interline communications on april 7 2011 judge friedman issued an order deferring any decision on class certification until the supreme court issued its decision in the walmart employment discrimination case the supreme court issued its decision on june 20 2011 and judge friedman required the parties to confer on the impact of the walmart decision plaintiffs and the defendant railroads filed briefs in august and early september stating their views on the impact of the walmart case on class certification in the fuel surcharge litigation the decision from judge friedman regarding class certification is still pending 

as we reported in our current report on form 8k filed on june 10 2011 the railroad received a copy of a complaint filed in the us district court for the district of columbia on june 7 2011 by oxbow carbon  minerals llc and related entities oxbow the complaint named the railroad and one other us class i railroad as defendants and alleged that the named railroads engaged in pricefixing and monopolistic practices in connection with fuel surcharge programs and pricing of shipments of certain commodities including coal and petroleum coke the complaint seeks injunctive relief and payment of 

  

damages of over 30 million and other unspecified damages including treble damages some of the allegations in the complaint are addressed in the existing fuel surcharge litigation referenced above the complaint also includes additional unrelated allegations regarding alleged limitations on competition for shipments of oxbow’s commodities judge friedman who presides over the fuel surcharge matter described above also presides over this matter the parties filed briefs and answers regarding the motions to dismiss the action filed by the defendant railroads and the court’s decision regarding this motion is pending 

we deny the allegations that our fuel surcharge programs violate the antitrust laws or any other laws and deny the other allegations in the oxbow complaint we believe that these lawsuits are without merit and we will vigorously defend our actions therefore we currently believe that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on any of our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

us customs and border protection cbp dispute and litigation – as we reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2010 cbp directed its field offices to issue penalties against the railroad beginning in december 2007 for discoveries of illegal drugs in freight cars crossing the border from mexico the freight cars were in trains delivered by mexican railroads directly to cbp the railroad received the trains only after cbp inspected them additionally cbp asserted or reinstated previously asserted penalties that had been held in abeyance while the railroad and cbp pursued a collective plan to address drug smuggling in some instances cbp seized freight cars in which drugs were found the parties resolved their dispute over the seized freight cars which were released by cbp for a payment by the railroad of 40000 the total amount of fines for drug seizures asserted by cbp prior to june 1 2011 exceeded 500 million 

on july 22 2011 the railroad and the acting commissioner of cbp signed an agreement under which the railroad does not pay any fines but commits to participate in and provide 50 million to fund a major initiative to enhance border and supply chain security for rail shipments transiting the border with mexico cbp will reduce all fines asserted prior to june 1 2011 other than those involved in the nebraska litigation discussed below to zero on a pro rata basis as the railroad makes expenditures of its 50 million commitment under the agreement cbp also agrees that it will not assert penalties for drugs found on or after june 1 2011 for a period of five years unless the railroad fails to carry out the agreement or the railroad or its personnel have specified degrees of involvement in drug smuggling the agreement does not compromise the position of either party regarding the validity of the fines cbp maintains its position that the fines were required by law while the railroad maintains its position that it has complied with all laws 

as previously reported in our disclosures regarding the cbp dispute and litigation the railroad filed a complaint in the us district court for the district of nebraska on july 31 2008 asking the court to enter 1 a judgment declaring that cbp’s penalties and seizures are invalid and unenforceable and 2 preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting cbp from enforcing penalties and holding seized freight cars and directing cbp to refrain from asserting additional penalties and from making future equipment seizures on december 19 2011 the district court ruled in favor of the railroad finding that the cbp acted outside of its authority in assessing the penalties the court also entered a permanent injunction that enjoins cbp from taking any action against the railroad for seizures of drugs found on railcars entering the us from mexico over which the railroad has no control the amount of fines involved in the nebraska litigation approximately 38 million is not material to the railroad therefore the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on any of our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

 results of operations 

operating revenues 

 

 we generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our six commodity groups freight revenues vary with volume carloads and average revenue per car arc changes in price traffic mix and fuel surcharges drive arc we provide some of our customers with contractual incentives for meeting or exceeding specified cumulative volumes or shipping to and from specific locations which we record as reductions to freight revenues based on the actual or projected future shipments we recognize freight revenues as shipments move from origin to destination we allocate freight revenues between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them 

other revenues include revenues earned by our subsidiaries revenues from our commuter rail operations and accessorial revenues which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us or when we perform additional services such as switching or storage we recognize other revenues as we perform services or meet contractual obligations 

freight revenues for all six commodity groups increased during 2011 compared to 2010 while volume increased in all except intermodal increased demand in many market sectors with particularly strong growth in chemical industrial products and automotive shipments for the year generated the increases arc increased 12 driven by higher fuel cost recoveries and core pricing gains fuel cost recoveries include fuel surcharge revenue and the impact of resetting the base fuel price for certain traffic which is described below in more detail higher fuel prices volume growth and new fuel surcharge provisions in renegotiated contracts all combined to increase revenues from fuel surcharges 

freight revenues and volume levels for all six commodity groups increased during 2010 as a result of economic improvement in many market sectors we experienced particularly strong volume growth in automotive intermodal and industrial products shipments core pricing gains and higher fuel surcharges also increased freight revenues and drove a 6 improvement in arc 

our fuel surcharge programs excluding indexbased contract escalators that contain some provision for fuel generated freight revenues of 22 billion 12 billion and 605 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively higher fuel prices volume growth and new fuel surcharge provisions in contracts renegotiated during the year increased fuel surcharge amounts in 2011 and 2010 furthermore for certain periods during 2009 fuel prices dropped below the base at which our mileagebased fuel surcharge begins which resulted in no fuel surcharge recovery for associated shipments during those periods additionally fuel surcharge revenue is not entirely comparable to prior periods as we continue to convert portions of our nonregulated traffic to mileagebased fuel surcharge programs 

in 2011 other revenues increased from 2010 due primarily to higher revenues at our subsidiaries that broker intermodal and automotive services 

  

in 2010 other revenues increased from 2009 due primarily to higher revenues at our subsidiaries that broker intermodal and automotive services assessorial revenues also increased in 2010 reflecting higher volume levels during the year 

the following tables summarize the yearoveryear changes in freight revenues revenue carloads and arc by commodity type 

 

  

   

 higher volume fuel surcharges and price improvements increased agricultural freight revenue in 2010 versus 2009 increased shipments from the midwest to export ports in the pacific northwest combined with heightened demand in mexico drove higher corn and feed grain shipments in 2010 increased corn and feed grain shipments into ethanol plants in california and idaho and continued growth in ethanol shipments also contributed to this increase in 2009 some ethanol plants temporarily ceased operations due to lower ethanol margins which contributed to the favorable yearoveryear comparison in addition strong export demand for us wheat via the gulf ports increased shipments of wheat and food grains compared to 2009 declines in domestic wheat and food shipments partially offset the growth in export shipments new business in feed and animal protein shipments also increased agricultural shipments in 2010 compared to 2009 

 

 increases of 37 and 24 in shipments of finished vehicles and automotive parts in 2010 respectively combined with core pricing gains and fuel surcharges improved automotive freight revenue from relatively weak 2009 levels economic conditions in 2009 led to poor auto sales and reduced vehicle production which in turn reduced shipments of finished vehicles and parts during the year 

 

   

higher volume price improvements and fuel surcharges increased freight revenue from chemicals in 2010 versus 2009 reduced inventories and purchases delayed from 2009 increased fertilizer shipments by 30 in 2010 a modest rebound in market conditions and more normalized inventory levels increased demand for industrial chemicals during the year driving volume levels up 8 versus 2009 in addition shipments of soda ash increased 12 as continued strong export demand outpaced weak 2009 export demand 

 

 core pricing gains higher fuel surcharges and modest volume growth increased freight revenue from energy shipments in 2010 compared to 2009 shipments from the sprb were up 4 driven by higher demand resulting from improved economic conditions warmer summer weather and more efficient deliveries higher tons per car and increased train size higher inventory levels carried over from 2009 partially offset this demand increase shipments from colorado and utah mines were down 8 in 2010 versus 2009 due to mine production interruptions and increased competition from other low cost fuel options natural gas and eastern coal weaker demand from our industrial customers and high inventories at some utility customer locations 

 

 volume gains core pricing improvement and higher fuel surcharges increased freight revenue from industrial products in 2010 versus 2009 a federal government remediation program involving removal of uranium mill tailings from a moab utah site drove an increase in shorthaul hazardous waste shipments versus 2009 shipments under this program began modestly during the second quarter of 2009 steel shipments also increased due to improving economic conditions while shipments of nonmetallic minerals primarily frac sand grew in response to more drilling for natural gas stone sand and gravel shipments grew in 2010 compared to 2009 as increased oil drilling more than offset the decline in commercial construction activity 

  

 

 increased volume higher fuel surcharges including new recovery provisions in contracts renegotiated in 2010 and pricing gains drove the increase in freight revenue from intermodal shipments in 2010 compared to 2009 domestic and international traffic increased from 2009 levels reflecting improvements in economic conditions international volumes grew in response to continued inventory restocking and higher consumer demand domestic shipments increased as a result of conversions from truck to rail fueled by improved service a new contract with hub group inc which included additional shipments was executed in the second quarter of 2009 and contributed to the increase in domestic shipments 

mexico business – each of our commodity groups includes revenue from shipments to and from mexico revenue from mexico business increased 16 to 18 billion in 2011 versus 2010 volume levels increased 9 in aggregate versus 2010 with particularly strong growth in automotive and industrial products energy was the one commodity group that declined as one of our customers conducted a supplier contract renewal during the year shifting transportation modes from rail to truck during the process 

revenue from mexico business increased 30 in 2010 versus 2009 to 16 billion volume levels for all six commodity groups increased up 25 in aggregate versus 2009 with particularly strong growth in automotive industrial products and intermodal shipments 

  

operating expenses 

 

  

 operating expenses increased 12 billion in 2010 versus 2009 our fuel price per gallon increased 31 during the year accounting for 566 million of the increase wage and benefit inflation depreciation volumerelated costs and property taxes also contributed to higher expenses during 2010 compared to 2009 cost savings from productivity improvements and better resource utilization partially offset these increases 

compensation and benefits – compensation and benefits include wages payroll taxes health and welfare costs pension costs other postretirement benefits and incentive costs a combination of general wage and benefit inflation volumerelated expenses higher training costs associated with new hires additional crew costs due to speed restrictions caused by the midwest flooding and heat and drought in the south and higher pension expense drove the increase during 2011 compared to 2010 

general wage and benefit inflation increased costs by approximately 190 million in 2010 compared to 2009 volumerelated expenses and higher equity and incentive compensation also drove costs up during the year workforce levels declined 1 in 2010 compared to 2009 as network efficiencies and ongoing productivity initiatives enabled us to effectively handle the 13 increase in volume levels with fewer employees 

fuel – fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and nonhighway vehicles and heavy equipment higher locomotive diesel fuel prices which averaged 312 including taxes and transportation costs in 2011 compared to 229 per gallon in 2010 increased expenses by 922 million in addition higher gasoline prices for highway and nonhighway vehicles also increased yearoveryear volume as measured by gross tonmiles increased 5 in 2011 versus 2010 driving expense up by 122 million 

higher diesel fuel prices which averaged 229 per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in 2010 compared to 175 per gallon in 2009 increased expenses by 566 million volume as measured by gross tonmiles increased 10 in 2010 versus 2009 driving fuel expense up by 166 million conversely the use of newer more fuel efficient locomotives our fuel conservation programs and efficient network operations drove a 3 improvement in our fuel consumption rate in 2010 resulting in 40 million of cost savings versus 2009 at the 2009 average fuel price 

  

purchased services and materials – expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors and other service providers including equipment maintenance and contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services materials used to maintain the railroad’s lines structures and equipment costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other railroads transportation and lodging for train crew employees trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers leased automobile maintenance expenses and tools and supplies expenses for contract services increased 106 million in 2011 versus 2010 driven by volumerelated external transportation services incurred by our subsidiaries and various other types of contractual services including floodrelated repairs mitigation and improvements volumerelated crew transportation and lodging costs as well as expenses associated with jointly owned operating facilities also increased costs compared to 2010 in addition an increase in locomotive maintenance materials used to prepare a portion of our locomotive fleet for return to active service due to increased volume and additional capacity for weather related issues and warranty expirations increased expenses in 2011 

a 148 million increase in costs for contract services drove the higher expenses in 2010 versus 2009 volumerelated trucking and lift costs for intermodal containers and crew transportation and lodging costs also increased costs from 2009 in addition an increase in locomotive maintenance materials used to prepare a portion of our locomotive fleet for return to active service increased expenses during the year compared to 2009 conversely a decrease in freight car maintenance activity during 2010 drove lower freight car material costs partially offsetting the cost increases versus 2009 

depreciation – the majority of depreciation relates to road property including rail ties ballast and other track material a higher depreciable asset base reflecting ongoing capital spending increased depreciation expense in 2011 compared to 2010 higher depreciation rates for rail and other track material also contributed to the increase the higher rates which became effective january 1 2011 resulted primarily from increased track usage based on higher gross tonmiles in 2010 

a higher depreciable asset base reflecting higher capital spending in recent years increased depreciation expense in 2010 compared to 2009 costs also increased 25 million in 2010 due to the restructuring of certain locomotive leases in the second quarter of 2009 lower depreciation rates for rail and other track material partially offset the increases the lower rates which became effective january 1 2010 resulted from reduced track usage based on lower gross tonmiles in 2009 

equipment and other rents – equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies freight car intermodal and locomotive leases and office and other rent expenses costs increased in 2011 versus 2010 as higher shortterm freight car rental expense and container lease expense offset lower freight car and locomotive lease expense 

shortterm freight car rental expense increased in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting increased shipments of finished vehicles and intermodal containers increased lease expenses for containers also drove the increase conversely lower lease expense for freight cars and locomotives decreased costs compared to 2009 the restructuring of locomotive leases completed in may 2009 also reduced lease expense by 36 million in 2010 compared to 2009 

other – other expenses include personal injury freight and property damage destruction of equipment insurance environmental bad debt state and local taxes utilities telephone and cellular employee travel computer software and other general expenses higher property taxes casualty costs associated with destroyed equipment damaged freight and property and environmental costs increased other costs in 2011 compared to 2010 a onetime payment of 45 million in the first quarter of 2010 related to a transaction with csxi and continued improvement in our safety performance and lower estimated liability for personal injury which reduced our personal injury expense yearoveryear partially offset increases in other costs 

other costs were higher in 2010 compared to 2009 driven by higher property taxes and the 45 million onetime payment in the first quarter of 2010 related to a transaction with csxi a 30 million payment in 2009 to pacer international inc and lower expenses for freight and property damages partially offset these increases in comparing 2009 with 2010 in addition personal injury expense was lower in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting continued improvement in our personal injury incident rate and lower settlement costs per claim the change in asbestosrelated claim expenses in 2010 versus 2009 offset 

  

the lower personal injury costs as a result of our 2009 annual review of asbestosrelated costs we reduced expenses by 25 million thus driving the unfavorable variance in 2010 

nonoperating items 

 

 other income – other income increased in 2011 versus 2010 due to higher gains from real estate sales lower environmental costs associated with nonoperating properties and the comparative impact of premiums paid for early redemption of longterm debt in the first quarter of 2010 

other income decreased in 2010 versus 2009 due to lower gains from real estate sales the second quarter of 2009 included a 116 million pretax gain from a land sale to the regional transportation district in colorado and premiums paid for early debt redemption 

interest expense – interest expense decreased in 2011 versus 2010 due to a lower weightedaverage debt level of 92 billion versus 97 billion the effective interest rate was 62 in both 2011 and 2010 

interest expense was flat in 2010 compared to 2009 due to a modestly higher weightedaverage debt level of 97 billion compared to 96 billion in 2009 offset by a lower effective interest rate of 62 in 2010 compared to 63 in 2009 

income taxes – higher pretax income increased income taxes in 2011 compared to 2010 our effective tax rate remained relatively flat at 375 in 2011 compared to 373 in 2010 

income taxes were higher in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily driven by higher pretax income our effective tax rate for the year was 373 compared to 364 in 2009 

other operatingperformance and financial statistics 

we report key performance measures weekly to the association of american railroads aar including carloads average daily inventory of freight cars on our system average train speed and average terminal dwell time we provide this data on our website at wwwupcominvestorsreportsindexshtml 

operatingperformance statistics 

railroad performance measures reported to the aar as well as other performance measures are included in the table below 

 

 average train speed – average train speed is calculated by dividing train miles by hours operated on our main lines between terminals the severe heat and drought in the south combined with extreme winter weather in february and severe midwest flooding had a greater impact than weather events in 2010 these weather challenges in addition to increased carloadings and traffic mix changes drove the 2 decline in 2011 compared to 2010 overall we continued operating a fluid and efficient network during 

  

2011 effectively handling the 3 increase in carloads maintenance activities and weather disruptions combined with higher volume levels led to a 4 decrease in average train speed in 2010 compared to a record set in 2009 

average terminal dwell time – average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our terminals lower average terminal dwell time improves asset utilization and service average terminal dwell time increased 3 in 2011 compared to 2010 additional volume weather challenges track replacement programs and a shift of traffic mix to more manifest shipments which require additional terminal processing all contributed to the increase average terminal dwell time increased 2 in 2010 compared to 2009 driven in part by our network plan to increase the length of numerous trains to improve overall efficiency which resulted in higher terminal dwell time for some cars 

average rail car inventory – average rail car inventory is the daily average number of rail cars on our lines including rail cars in storage lower average rail car inventory reduces congestion in our yards and sidings which increases train speed reduces average terminal dwell time and improves rail car utilization average rail car inventory decreased slightly in 2011 compared to 2010 as we continued to adjust the size of our freight car fleet average rail car inventory decreased 3 in 2010 compared to 2009 while we handled a 13 increase in carloads during the period compared to 2009 we maintained more freight cars offline and retired a number of old freight cars which drove the decrease 

gross and revenue tonmiles – gross tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled revenue tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles gross and revenuetonmiles increased 5 in 2011 compared to 2010 driven by a 3 increase in carloads and mix changes to heavier commodity groups notably a 5 increase in energy shipments gross and revenuetonmiles increased 10 and 9 respectively in 2010 compared to 2009 due to a 13 increase in carloads commodity mix changes notably automotive shipments drove the variance in yearoveryear growth between gross tonmiles revenue tonmiles and carloads 

operating ratio – operating ratio is our operating expenses reflected as a percentage of operating revenue our operating ratio increased 01 points to 707 in 2011 versus 2010 higher fuel prices inflation and weather related costs partially offset by core pricing gains and productivity initiatives drove the increase our operating ratio improved 55 points to 706 in 2010 and 13 points to 761 in 2009 efficiently leveraging volume increases core pricing gains and productivity initiatives drove the improvement in 2010 and more than offset the impact of higher fuel prices during the year 

employees – employee levels were up 5 in 2011 versus 2010 driven by a 3 increase in volume levels a higher number of trainmen engineers and yard employees receiving training during the year and increased work on capital projects employee levels were down 1 in 2010 compared to 2009 despite a 13 increase in volume levels we leveraged the additional volumes through network efficiencies and other productivity initiatives in addition we successfully managed the growth of our fulltimeequivalent train and engine force levels at a rate less than half of our carload growth in 2010 all other operating functions and support organizations reduced their fulltimeequivalent force levels benefiting from continued productivity initiatives 

customer satisfaction index – our customer satisfaction survey asks customers to rate how satisfied they are with our performance over the last 12 months on a variety of attributes a higher score indicates higher customer satisfaction we believe that improvement in survey results in 2011 generally reflects customer recognition of our service quality supported by our capital investment program 

return on average common shareholders’ equity 

 

   

return on invested capital as adjusted roic 

 

 roic is considered a nongaap financial measure by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe this measure is important in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our longterm capital investments in addition we currently use roic as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of equity compensation for our executives roic should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for other information provided in accordance with gaap the most comparable gaap measure is return on average common shareholders’ equity the tables above provide reconciliations from return on average common shareholders’ equity to roic our 2011 roic improved 16 points compared to 2010 primarily as a result of higher earnings and lower debt levels 

debt to capital  adjusted debt to capital 

 

 adjusted debt to capital is a nongaap financial measure under sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk we believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the total amount of leverage in our capital structure including offbalance sheet lease obligations which we generally incur in connection with financing the acquisition of locomotives and freight cars and certain facilities operating leases were discounted using 62 at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 the discount rate reflects current interest rates and financing costs we monitor the ratio of adjusted debt to capital as we manage our capital structure to balance costeffective and efficient access to the capital markets with our overall cost of capital adjusted debt to capital should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for debt to capital the tables above provide reconciliations from debt to capital to adjusted debt to capital our december 31 2011 debt to capital ratios decreased as a result of a 336 million net decrease in debt from december 31 2010 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2011 our principal sources of liquidity included cash cash equivalents our receivables securitization facility and our revolving credit facility as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets we had 18 billion of committed credit available under our credit facility with no borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2011 we did not make any borrowings under this facility during 2011 the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the receivables securitization facility was 100 million as of december 31 2011 and is included in our consolidated statements of financial position as debt due after one year the receivables securitization facility obligates us to maintain an investment grade bond rating if our bond rating were to deteriorate it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financings is dependent on market conditions deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability we expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity by issuing bonds to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets 

at december 31 2011 and 2010 we had a working capital surplus this reflects a strong cash position which provides enhanced liquidity in an uncertain economic environment in addition we believe we have adequate access to capital markets to meet cash requirements and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

 

 operating activities 

higher net income and lower cash income tax payments in 2011 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2010 the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 2010 enacted in december 2010 provided for 100 bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2011 and 50 bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2012 as a result of the act the company deferred a substantial portion of its 2011 income tax expense this deferral decreased 2011 income tax payments thereby contributing to the positive operating cash flow in future years however additional cash will be used to pay income taxes that were previously deferred in addition the adoption of a new accounting standard in january of 2010 changed the accounting treatment for our receivables securitization facility from a sale of undivided interests recorded as an operating activity to a secured borrowing recorded as a financing activity which decreased cash provided by operating activities by 400 million in 2010 higher net income in 2010 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2009 

investing activities 

higher capital investments partially offset by higher proceeds from asset sales in 2011 drove the increase in cash used in investing activities compared to 2010 higher capital investments and lower proceeds from asset sales in 2010 drove the increase in cash used in investing activities compared to 2009 

  

the tables below detail cash capital investments and track statistics for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

 capital plan – in 2012 we expect our total capital investments to be approximately 36 billion which may be revised if business conditions warrant or if new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments we expect that over 50 of our 2012 capital investments will replace and improve existing capital assets major investment categories include replacing and improving track infrastructure upgrading our locomotive freight car and container fleet including acquisition of 200 locomotives and 1800 freight cars including large covered hoppers gondolas and small covered hoppers improving technology including investing in ptc and other capital projects additionally we will continue to increase our network and terminal capacity for example to balance terminal capacity with mainline capacity being added by our doubletracking project on the sunset corridor we are constructing a rail facility at santa teresa new mexico that initially will include a runthrough and fueling facility and an intermodal ramp 

we expect to fund our 2012 cash capital investments by using some or all of the following cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and cash on hand our annual capital plan is a critical component of our longterm strategic plan which we expect will enhance the longterm value of the corporation for our shareholders by providing sufficient resources to i replace and improve our existing track infrastructure to provide safe and fluid operations ii increase network efficiency by adding or improving facilities and track and iii make investments that meet customer demand and take advantage of opportunities for longterm growth 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities increased in 2011 versus 2010 higher dividend payments in 2011 of 837 million compared to 602 million in 2010 reflecting our increased dividend rate and the repurchase of 14 billion of our common stock a 169 million increase from 2010 repurchases drove the increase we used less cash to reduce outstanding debt in 2011 which partially offset this increase cash used in financing activities increased in 2010 versus 2009 during 2010 we repurchased 12 billion of shares under our common stock repurchase program compared to no repurchases in 2009 additionally our net debt reduction in 2010 was 518 million compared to 28 million in 2009 which also contributed to the increase in cash used in financing activities in 2010 

  

credit facilities – during the second quarter of 2011 we replaced our 19 billion revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in april 2012 with a new 18 billion facility that expires in may 2015 the facility the facility is based on substantially similar terms as those in the previous credit facility on december 31 2011 we had 18 billion of credit available under the facility which is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper we did not draw on either facility during 2011 commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investmentgrade borrowers the facility allows for borrowings at floating rates based on london interbank offered rates plus a spread depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings the facility requires the corporation to maintain a debttonetworth coverage ratio as a condition to making a borrowing at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 and at all times during the year we were in compliance with this covenant 

the definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the debttonetworth coverage ratio includes among other things certain credit arrangements capital leases guarantees and unfunded and vested pension benefits under title iv of erisa at december 31 2011 the debttonetworth coverage ratio allowed us to carry up to 372 billion of debt as defined in the facility and we had 95 billion of debt as defined in the facility outstanding at that date under our current capital plans we expect to continue to satisfy the debttonetworth coverage ratio however many factors beyond our reasonable control including the risk factors in item 1a of this report could affect our ability to comply with this provision in the future the facility does not include any other financial restrictions credit rating triggers other than ratingdependent pricing or any other provision that could require us to post collateral the facility also includes a 75 million crossdefault provision and a changeofcontrol provision 

during 2011 we did not issue or repay any commercial paper and at december 31 2011 and 2010 we had no commercial paper outstanding our revolving credit facility supports outstanding commercial paper balances which do not reduce the amount of borrowings available under the facility 

at december 31 2011 and 2010 we reclassified as longterm debt approximately 100 million of debt due within one year that we intend to refinance this reclassification reflected our ability and intent to refinance any shortterm borrowings and certain current maturities of longterm debt on a longterm basis 

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

for each of the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 84 69 and 49 respectively the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis earnings represent income from continuing operations less equity earnings net of distributions plus fixed charges and income taxes fixed charges represent interest charges amortization of debt discount and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges see exhibit 12 to this report for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

common shareholders’ equity 

dividend restrictions – our revolving credit facility includes a debttonet worth covenant discussed in the credit facilities section above that under certain circumstances restricts the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders the amount of retained earnings available for dividends was 138 billion and 129 billion at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

share repurchase program – the shares repurchased in 2010 and the first quarter of 2011 shown in the table below were repurchased under our repurchase program that expired on march 31 2011 effective april 1 2011 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of 40 million shares of our common stock by march 31 2014 replacing our previous repurchase program the shares repurchased in the second third and fourth quarters of 2011 shown in the table below were purchased under the new program as of december 31 2011 we repurchased a total of 57 billion of our common stock since the commencement of purchases under our repurchase programs 

 

 management’s assessments of market conditions and other pertinent facts guide the timing and volume of all repurchases we expect to fund any share repurchases under this program through cash generated from operations the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties debt issuances and cash on hand repurchased shares are recorded in treasury stock at cost which includes any applicable commissions and fees 

shelf registration statement and significant new borrowings – under our current shelf registration we may issue from time to time any combination of debt securities preferred stock common stock or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings we have no immediate plans to issue equity securities however we will continue to explore opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under our shelf registration and therefore we may issue additional debt securities at any time 

during 2011 we issued the following unsecured fixedrate debt securities under our current shelf registration 

 

 the net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes including the repurchase of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program these debt securities include changeofcontrol provisions at december 31 2011 we had remaining authority to issue up to 20 billion of debt securities under our shelf registration 

during the third quarter of 2011 we renegotiated and extended for three years on substantially similar terms a 100 million floatingrate term loan which will mature on august 5 2016 

debt exchange – on june 23 2011 we exchanged 857 million of various outstanding notes and debentures due between 2013 and 2019 existing notes for 750 million of 4163 notes new notes due july 15 2022 plus cash consideration of approximately 267 million and 17 million for accrued and unpaid interest on the existing notes the cash consideration was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of debt and the balance of the unamortized discount and issue costs from the existing notes is being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the term of the new notes no gain or loss was recognized as a result of the exchange costs related to the debt exchange that were payable to parties other than the debt holders totaled approximately 6 million and were included in interest expense during the year ended december 31 2011 

  

the following table lists the outstanding notes and debentures that were exchanged 

 

 on july 14 2010 we exchanged 376 million of 7875 notes due in 2019 existing notes for 578 notes new notes due july 15 2040 plus cash consideration of approximately 96 million and 15 million for accrued and unpaid interest on the existing notes the cash consideration was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of debt and the balance of the unamortized discount and issue costs from the existing notes is being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the term of the new notes there was no gain or loss recognized as a result of the exchange costs related to the debt exchange that were payable to parties other than the debtholders totaled approximately 2 million and were included in interest expense during the third quarter 

debt redemptions – on december 19 2011 we redeemed the remaining 175 million of our 65 notes due april 15 2012 and all 300 million of our outstanding 6125 notes due january 15 2012 the redemptions resulted in an early extinguishment charge of 5 million on march 22 2010 we redeemed 175 million of our 65 notes due april 15 2012 the redemption resulted in an early extinguishment charge of 16 million in the first quarter of 2010 on november 1 2010 we redeemed all 400 million of our outstanding 665 notes due january 15 2011 the redemption resulted in a 5 million early extinguishment charge 

receivables securitization facility – on january 1 2010 we adopted accounting standards update no 200916 accounting for transfers of financial assets asu 200916 asu 200916 limits the circumstances in which transferred financial assets can be derecognized and requires enhanced disclosures regarding transfers of financial assets and a transferor’s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets as a result we no longer account for the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under our receivables securitization facility as a sale in addition transfers of receivables occurring on or after january 1 2010 are reflected as debt issued in our consolidated statements of cash flows and recognized as debt due after one year in our consolidated statements of financial position 

under the receivables securitization facility the railroad sells most of its accounts receivable to union pacific receivables inc upri a bankruptcyremote subsidiary upri may subsequently transfer without recourse on a 364day revolving basis an undivided interest in eligible accounts receivable to investors the total capacity to transfer undivided interests to investors under the facility was 600 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the facility was 100 million at both december 31 2011 and 2010 the value of the undivided interest held by investors was supported by 11 billion and 960 million of accounts receivable at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively at december 31 2011 and 2010 the value of the interest retained by upri was 11 billion and 960 million respectively this retained interest is included in accounts receivable net in our consolidated statements of financial position 

the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors could fluctuate based upon the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks including default and dilution if default or dilution ratios increase one percent the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would not change as of december 31 2011 should our credit rating fall below investment grade the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would be reduced and in certain cases the investors would have the right to discontinue the facility 

  

the railroad collected approximately 188 billion and 163 billion of receivables during the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively upri used certain of these proceeds to purchase new receivables under the facility 

the costs of the receivables securitization facility include interest which will vary based on prevailing commercial paper rates program fees paid to banks commercial paper issuing costs and fees for unused commitment availability the costs of the receivables securitization facility are included in interest expense and were 4 million and 6 million for 2011 and 2010 respectively prior to adoption of the new accounting standard the costs of the receivables securitization facility were included in other income and were 9 million for 2009 

the investors have no recourse to the railroad’s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims creditors of the railroad do not have recourse to the assets of upri 

in august 2011 the receivables securitization facility was renewed for an additional 364day period at comparable terms and conditions 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and as referenced in the tables below we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments including material sources of offbalance sheet and structured finance arrangements other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets as described in item 1a of part ii of this report there is no known trend demand commitment event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition our commercial obligations financings and commitments are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations particularly within the transportation industry 

the following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of december 31 2011 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

guarantees – at december 31 2011 we were contingently liable for 325 million in guarantees we have recorded a liability of 3 million for the fair value of these obligations as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business and they include guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building equipment financings and affiliated operations the final guarantee expires in 2022 we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

other matters 

labor agreements – in january 2010 the nation’s largest freight railroads began the current round of negotiations with the labor unions generally contract negotiations with the various unions take place over an extended period of time this round of negotiations was no exception in september 2011 the rail industry reached agreements with the united transportation union on november 5 2011 a presidential emergency board peb appointed by president obama issued recommendations to resolve the disputes between the us railroads and 11 unions that had not yet reached agreements since then ten unions reached agreements with the railroads all of them generally patterned on the recommendations of the peb and the unions subsequently ratified these agreements the railroad industry reached a tentative agreement with the brotherhood of maintenance of way employees bmwe on february 2 2012 eliminating the immediate threat of a national rail strike the bmwe now will commence ratification of this tentative agreement by its members 

inflation – long periods of inflation significantly increase asset replacement costs for capitalintensive companies as a result assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels depreciation charges on an inflationadjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 

derivative financial instruments – we may use derivative financial instruments in limited instances to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and fuel prices we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged both at inception and throughout the hedged period we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items at inception as well as our riskmanagement objectives strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness changes in the fair market value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are charged to earnings we may use swaps collars futures andor forward contracts to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in interest rates and fuel prices however the use of these derivative financial instruments may limit future benefits from favorable price movements 

  

market and credit risk – we address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item we manage credit risk related to derivative financial instruments which is minimal by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements at december 31 2011 and 2010 we were not required to provide collateral nor had we received collateral relating to our hedging activities 

determination of fair value – we determine the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or the present value of expected future cash flows 

sensitivity analyses – the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 

at december 31 2011 we had variablerate debt representing approximately 23 of our total debt if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2012 than our december 31 2011 variable rate which was approximately 12 our interest expense would increase by approximately 2 million this amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balances of our variablerate debt at december 31 2011 

market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2011 and amounts to an increase of approximately 924 million to the fair value of our debt at december 31 2011 we estimated the fair values of our fixedrate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 

interest rate fair value hedges – we manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period we generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings we employ derivatives primarily swaps as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix in addition we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixedrate debt securities 

swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt’s fair value attributable to the changes in interest rates we account for swaps as fair value hedges using the shortcut method as allowed by the derivatives and hedging topic of the fasb accounting standards codification asc therefore we do not record any ineffectiveness within our consolidated financial statements 

interest rate cash flow hedges – we report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affects earnings at december 31 2011 and 2010 we recorded reductions of 2 million and 3 million respectively as an accumulated other comprehensive loss that is being amortized on a straightline basis through september 30 2014 as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding 

recently issued accounting pronouncements – in june 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201105 comprehensive income topic 220 presentation of comprehensive income asu 201105 asu 201105 will require companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements it eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity the standard does not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive income how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified to net income this standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 because this asu impacts presentation only it will have no effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

asserted and unasserted claims – various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries we cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity however to the extent possible where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably 

  

estimated we have recorded a liability we do not expect that any known lawsuits claims environmental costs commitments contingent liabilities or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters 

indemnities – our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements including certain tax indemnifications can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions 

climate change – although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item 1a of this report we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact however we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment including investments in new technologies using training programs to reduce fuel consumption and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 2 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 these critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 

personal injury – the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability including unasserted claims the federal employers’ liability act fela governs compensation for workrelated accidents under fela damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or outofcourt settlements we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 

our personal injury liability is discounted to present value using applicable us treasury rates approximately 89 of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 11 related to unasserted claims at december 31 2011 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 368 million to 404 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss is more probable than any other our personal injury liability activity was as follows 

 

   

our personal injury claims activity was as follows 

 

 asbestos – we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other parties allege exposure to asbestos we assess our potential liability using a statistical analysis of resolution costs for asbestosrelated claims this liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing costs the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions 

 

    our liability for asbestosrelated claims is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments approximately 21 of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 79 related to unasserted claims at december 31 2011 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestosrelated claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 147 million to 159 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss is more probable than any other in conjunction with the liability update performed in 2011 we also reassessed estimated insurance recoveries we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2011 and 2010 

our asbestosrelated liability activity was as follows 

 

 we believe that our estimates of liability for asbestosrelated claims and insurance recoveries are reasonable and probable the amounts recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts however future events such as the number of new claims to be filed each year average settlement costs and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts estimates also may vary in the future if strategies activities and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change federal and state laws governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of 

  

compensation of claimants and there are material changes with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants 

environmental – we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations we identified 285 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements this includes 32 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government 17 of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 

when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in our business we perform with the assistance of our consultants environmental assessments on the property we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and we can reasonably estimate such costs we do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable at december 31 2011 less than 1 of our environmental liability was discounted at 20 while approximately 5 of our environmental liability was discounted at 28 at december 31 2010 our environmental liability activity was as follows 

 

 the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties cost estimates are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and existing technology laws and regulations the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties sitespecific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal state and local laws governing environmental remediation current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

property and depreciation – our railroad operations are highly capital intensive and our large base of homogeneous networktype assets turns over on a continuous basis each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated service lives which are measured in years except for rail in highdensity traffic corridors ie all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment yard and switching tracks and electronic yards for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics use and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes 

  

and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources not as singular items we currently have more than 60 depreciable asset classes and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology asset strategies or other factors 

we determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property by means of depreciation studies we perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets ie rail and other track material ties and ballast and other road property our depreciation studies take into account the following factors 

 

    for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track it has been our experience that the lives of rail in highdensity traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage ie the amount of weight carried over the rail the service lives also vary based on rail weight rail condition eg new or secondhand and rail type eg straight or curve our depreciation studies for rail in high density traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross tonmiles carried over the rail ie the weight of loaded and empty freight cars locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile rail in highdensity traffic corridors accounts for approximately 70 percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material based on the number of gross tonmiles carried over our rail in high density traffic corridors during 2011 the estimated service lives of the majority of this rail ranged from approximately 15 years to approximately 30 years for all other depreciable assets we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively 

estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to changes in physical use technology asset strategies and other factors that will have an impact on the retirement profiles of our assets we are not aware of any specific factors that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service lives of our assets actual use and retirement of our assets may vary from our current estimates which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future periods 

changes in estimated useful lives of our assets due to the results of our depreciation studies could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately 50 million if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were decreased by one year annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately 53 million our recent depreciation studies have resulted in changes in depreciation rates for some asset classes but did not significantly affect our annual depreciation expense 

under group depreciation the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using i inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ii the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate in addition we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies any deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets 

  

for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions i is unusual ii is material in amount and iii varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies during the last three fiscal years no gains or losses were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad properties a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations 

income taxes – we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns these expected future tax consequences are measured based on current tax law the effects of future tax legislation are not anticipated future tax legislation such as a change in the corporate tax rate could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity for example a 1 increase in future income tax rates would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately 320 million 

when appropriate we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reflect that these tax assets may not be realized in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized based on management’s judgments using available evidence for purposes of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize a deferred tax asset in 2011 and 2010 there were no valuation allowances 

we recognize tax benefits that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement a liability for “unrecognized tax benefits” is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards 

pension and other postretirement benefits – we use an actuarial analysis to measure the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and medical and life insurance benefits opeb to eligible employees in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make several assumptions the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets for opeb the critical assumptions are the discount rate and health care cost trend rate 

we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually and selected assumptions are based on the following factors 

 

   the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit for 2011 and the estimated impact on 2011 net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit relative to a change in those assumptions 

 

   

 the following table presents the net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit for the years ended december 31 

 

 our net periodic pension cost is expected to increase to approximately 88 million in 2012 from 78 million in 2011 the increase is driven mainly by a decrease in the discount rate to 454 our net periodic opeb expense is expected to increase to approximately 11 million in 2012 from 6 million benefit in 2011 the increase in our net periodic opeb cost is primarily driven by a decrease in the amortization of prior service credits from accumulated other comprehensive income

additionally the ceo and cfo determined that there were no changes to the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting 

  

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

the management of union pacific corporation and subsidiary companies the corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f the corporation’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the corporation’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 

all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

the corporation’s management assessed the effectiveness of the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 in making this assessment it used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control – integrated framework based on our assessment management believes that as of december 31 2011 the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 

the corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting this report appears on the next page

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of union pacific corporation and subsidiary companies the corporation as of december 31 2011 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting  our responsibility is to express an opinion on the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended december 31 2011 of the corporation and our report dated february 3 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule

industrial products – our extensive network enables us to move numerous commodities between thousands of origin and destination points throughout north america lumber shipments originate primarily in the pnw and canada for destinations throughout the us for new home construction and repair and remodeling commercial and highway construction drives shipments of steel and construction products consisting of rock cement and roofing materials paper and consumer goods as well as furniture and appliances are shipped to major metropolitan areas for consumers nonferrous metals and industrial minerals are moved for industrial manufacturing in addition we provide efficient and safe transportation for government entities and waste companies in 2010 transporting industrial products provided 16 of our freight revenues 

intermodal – our intermodal business which represented 20 of our freight revenues in 2010 includes international and domestic shipments international business consists of imported or exported container traffic that arrives at or departs from west coast ports via ocean vessel domestic business includes domestic container and trailer traffic for major retailers and other us businesses that is usually sold through intermodal marketing companies primarily shipper agents and consolidators and truckload carriers 

seasonality – some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons reflecting either or both the nature of the commodity such as certain agricultural and food products that have specific growing and harvesting seasons and the demand cycle for the commodity such as intermodal traffic which generally has a peak shipping season during the third quarter to meet holidayrelated demand for consumer goods during the fourth quarter the peak shipping seasons for these commodities can vary considerably from year to year depending upon various factors including the strength of domestic and international economies and currencies and the strength of harvests and market prices of agricultural products in response to an annual request delivered by the surface transportation board stb of the us department of transportation dot to all of the class i railroads operating in the us we issue a publicly available letter during the third quarter detailing our plans for handling traffic during the third and fourth quarters and providing other information requested by the stb 

working capital – at december 31 2010 and 2009 we had a working capital surplus which in 2010 continued to be the result of our decision in 2009 to maintain additional cash reserves to enhance liquidity in response to uncertain economic conditions historically we have had a working capital deficit which is common in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity we maintain adequate resources and when necessary have access to capital to meet any daily and shortterm cash requirements and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

competition – we are subject to competition from other railroads motor carriers ship and barge operators and pipelines our main rail competitor is burlington northern santa fe corporation its rail subsidiary bnsf railway company bnsf operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors in addition we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers motor carrier competition exists for five of our six commodity groups excluding energy because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and gulf coast waterways barges can be particularly competitive especially for grain and bulk commodities in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service while we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation or legislation releasing motor carriers from their size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

key suppliers – we depend on two key domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives due to the capital intensive nature of the locomotive manufacturing business and sophistication of this equipment potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry in this industry therefore if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives for any reason including insolvency or bankruptcy we could experience a significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations additionally for a high percentage of our rail purchases we utilize two suppliers one domestic and one international that meet our specifications rail is critical for both maintenance of our network and replacement and improvement or expansion of our network and facilities rail manufacturing also has high barriers to entry and if one of those suppliers discontinues operations for any reason including insolvency or bankruptcy we could experience cost increases and difficulty obtaining rail 

employees – approximately 86 of our 42884 fulltimeequivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions current labor agreements became subject to modification on january 1 2010 in january 2010 we began the current round of negotiations with the unions existing agreements remain in effect and will continue to remain in effect until new agreements are reached or the railway labor act’s procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential emergency boards and congressional intervention are exhausted contract negotiations with the various unions generally take place over an extended period of time and we rarely experience work stoppages during negotiations 

railroad security – operating a safe and secure railroad is first among our critical priorities and is a primary responsibility of all our employees this emphasis helps us protect the public our employees our customers and operations across our rail network our security efforts rely upon a wide variety of measures including employee training cooperation with our customers training of emergency responders and partnerships with numerous federal state and local government agencies while federal law requires us to protect the confidentiality of our security plans designed to safeguard against terrorism and other security incidents the following provides a general overview of our security initiatives 

uprr security measures – we maintain a comprehensive security plan designed to both deter and to respond to any potential or actual threats as they arise the plan includes four levels of alert status each with its own set of countermeasures we employ our own police force consisting of more than 225 commissioned and highlytrained officers our employees also undergo recurrent security and preparedness training as well as federallymandated hazardous materials and security training we regularly review the sufficiency of our employee training programs to identify ways to increase preparedness and to improve security 

we have an emergency response management center which operates 24 hours a day the center receives reports of emergencies dangerous or potentially dangerous conditions and other safety and security issues from our employees the public and law enforcement and other government officials in cooperation with government officials we monitor both threats and public events and as necessary we may alter rail traffic flow at times of concern to minimize risk to communities we serve and our operations we comply with the hazardous materials routing rules and other requirements imposed by federal law we also design our operating plan to expedite the movement of hazardous material shipments to minimize the time rail cars remain idle at yards and terminals located in or near major population centers additionally in compliance with new transportation security agency regulations that took effect on april 1 2009 we deployed new information systems and instructed employees in tracking and documenting the handoff of rail security sensitive material with customers and interchange partners 

we also have established a number of our own innovative safety and securityoriented initiatives ranging from various investments in technology to the officer on the train program which provides local law enforcement officers with the opportunity to ride with train crews to enhance their understanding of railroad operations and risks 

cooperation with federal state and local government agencies – we work closely with government agencies ranging from the dot and the department of homeland security dhs to local police departments fire departments and other first responders in conjunction with dot dhs and other railroads we sponsor operation respond which provides first responders with secure links to electronic railroad resources including mapping systems shipment records and other essential information required by emergency personnel to respond to accidents and other situations we also participate in the 

  

national joint terrorism task force a multiagency effort established by the us department of justice and the federal bureau of investigation to combat and prevent terrorism 

we work with the coast guard us customs and border protection cbp formerly the us customs service and the military transport management command to monitor shipments entering the uprr rail network at us border crossings and ports we were the first railroad in the us to be named a partner in cbp’s customstrade partnership against terrorism a partnership designed to develop enhance and maintain effective security processes throughout the global supply chain 

cooperation with customers and trade associations – along with other railroads we work with the american chemistry council to train more than 200000 emergency responders each year we work closely with our chemical shippers to establish plant security plans and we continue to take steps to more closely monitor and track hazardous materials shipments in cooperation with the federal railroad administration fra and other railroads we are also working to develop additional improvements to tank car design that will further limit the risk of releases of hazardous materials 

governmental and environmental regulation 

governmental regulation – our operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local regulations generally applicable to all businesses see also the discussion of certain regulatory proceedings in legal proceedings item 3 

the operations of the railroad are also subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the stb the stb has jurisdiction over rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic common carrier service of regulated traffic freight car compensation transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines and acquisition of control of rail common carriers the stb has launched wideranging proceedings to explore whether to expand rail regulation we will actively participate in these proceedings additionally several bills were introduced in the us senate in early 2011 that would expand the regulatory authority of the stb and could include new antitrust provisions we are closely monitoring these proposed bills 

the operations of the railroad also are subject to the regulations of the fra and other federal and state agencies on january 12 2010 the fra issued final rules governing installation of positive train control ptc by the end of 2015 although still under development ptc is a collision avoidance technology intended to override locomotive controls and stop a train before an accident the fra acknowledged that projected costs will exceed projected benefits by a ratio of about 22 to one we expect to invest approximately 250 million in the development of ptc during 2011 

dot the occupational safety and health administration and dhs along with other federal agencies have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety movement of hazardous materials and hazardous waste emissions requirements and equipment standards on october 16 2008 president bush signed the rail safety improvement act of 2008 into law which among other things revised hours of service rules for train and certain other railroad employees mandated implementation of ptc imposed passenger service requirements addressed safety at rail crossings increased the number of safety related employees of the fra and increased fines that may be levied against railroads for safety violations additionally various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in areas not preempted by federal law 

environmental regulation – we are subject to extensive federal and state environmental statutes and regulations pertaining to public health and the environment the statutes and regulations are administered and monitored by the environmental protection agency epa and by various state environmental agencies the primary laws affecting our operations are the resource conservation and recovery act regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act regulating the cleanup of contaminated properties the clean air act regulating air emissions and the clean water act regulating waste water discharges

 item 1a risk factors 

the information set forth in this item 1a should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this report including management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item 7 and financial statements and supplementary data item 8 

we must manage fluctuating demand for our services and network capacity – if there is significant demand for our services that exceeds the designed capacity of our network we may experience network difficulties including congestion and reduced velocity that could compromise the level of service we provide to our customers this level of demand may also compound the impact of weather and weatherrelated events on our operations and velocity although we continue to improve our transportation plan add capacity and improve operations at our yards and other facilities we cannot be sure that these measures will fully or adequately address any service shortcomings resulting from demand exceeding our planned capacity we may experience other operational or service difficulties related to network capacity dramatic and unplanned increases or decreases of demand for rail service with respect to one or more of our commodity groups or other events that could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in the event that we experience significant reductions of demand for rail services with respect to one or more of our commodity groups we may experience increased costs associated with resizing our operations including higher unit operating costs and costs for the storage of locomotives rail cars and other equipment workforce adjustments and other related activities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to significant governmental regulation – we are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal state and local authorities covering a variety of health safety labor environmental economic as discussed below and other matters many laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses permits and other authorizations and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us governments or regulators may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate without providing us any recourse to address any adverse effects on our business including without limitation regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution business relationships with other railroads calculation of our cost of capital or other inputs relevant to computing our revenue adequacy the prices we charge and costs and expenses significant legislative activity in congress or regulatory activity by the stb could expand regulation of railroad operations and prices for rail services which could reduce capital spending on our rail network facilities and equipment and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity as part of the rail safety improvement act of 2008 railroad carriers must implement ptc by the end of 2015 which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make other capital investments one or more consolidations of class i railroads could also lead to increased regulation of the rail industry 

we are required to transport hazardous materials – federal laws require railroads including us to transport hazardous materials regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss any rail accident or other incident or accident on our network at our facilities or at the facilities of our customers involving the release of hazardous materials including toxic inhalation hazard or tih materials such as chlorine could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury property damage and environmental penalties and remediation which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we may be affected by general economic conditions – prolonged severe adverse domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of financial and credit markets including the availability of short and longterm debt financing may affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry and may have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity and our results of operations and financial condition 

we face competition from other railroads and other transportation providers – we face competition from other railroads motor carriers ships barges and pipelines in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service while we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation or legislation releasing motor carriers from their size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition 

  

and liquidity additionally any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect the competitive environment in which we operate 

strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations as the majority of our employees belong to labor unions and labor agreements – the us class i railroads are party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in among other things strikes work stoppages slowdowns or lockouts which could cause a significant disruption of our operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could compromise our service reliability or significantly increase our costs for health care wages and other benefits which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures – as a railroad with a vast network we are exposed to severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods mudslides or landslides extreme temperatures and significant precipitation that may cause business interruptions including line outages on our rail network that can adversely affect our entire rail network and result in increased costs increased liabilities and decreased revenue which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations – we rely on information technology in all aspects of our business if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if we are unable to implement new technology we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally if we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment we could experience a service interruption safety failure security breach or other operational difficulties which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures – as a railroad with operations in densely populated urban areas and other cities and a vast rail network we are exposed to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage environmental liability and other matters any material changes to litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving any or all of property damage personal injury and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

the availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations – changes in demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to meet demand for rail service unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to significant environmental laws and regulations – due to the nature of the railroad business our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waters handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and hazardous material or petroleum releases we generate and transport hazardous and nonhazardous waste in our operations and we did so in our former operations environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties leased properties and properties owned by third parties as well as to properties we currently own environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation we have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated or are strictly liable under these laws or regulations we could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we may be affected by climate change and market or regulatory responses to climate change – climate change including the impact of global warming could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gasses including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating costs restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that a use commodities that we carry to produce energy b use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry or c manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels including chemical producers farmers and food producers and automakers and other manufacturers significant cost increases government regulation or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns including for example the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers finally we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change any of these factors individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

rising or elevated fuel costs and whether we are able to mitigate these costs with fuel surcharges could materially and adversely affect our business – fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses diesel fuel prices are subject to dramatic fluctuations and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results although we currently are able to recover a significant amount of our increased fuel expenses through revenue from fuel surcharges we cannot be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elevated fuel costs through surcharges future market conditions or legislative or regulatory activities could adversely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharges or adequately recover increased fuel costs through fuel surcharges international political and economic circumstances affect fuel prices and supplies weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity if a fuel supply shortage were to arise higher fuel prices could despite our fuel surcharge programs have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we utilize capital markets – due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements we utilize longterm debt instruments bank financing and commercial paper from timetotime and we pledge certain of our receivables significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets including the credit markets or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to and significantly increase the cost of commercial paper and other financing sources including bank credit facilities and the issuance of longterm debt including corporate bonds a deterioration of our financial condition could result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade which could prohibit or restrict us from utilizing our current receivables securitization facility or accessing external sources of short and longterm debt financing and significantly increase the costs associated with utilizing the receivables securitization facility and issuing both commercial paper and longterm debt 

we are subject to legislative regulatory and legal developments involving taxes – taxes are a significant part of our expenses we are subject to us federal state and foreign income payroll property sales and use fuel and other types of taxes changes in tax rates enactment of new tax laws revisions of tax regulations and claims or litigation with taxing authorities could result in substantially higher taxes and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are dependent on certain key suppliers of locomotives and rail – due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry therefore if one of the domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives discontinues manufacturing locomotives for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience significant cost increases and reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations additionally for a high percentage of our rail purchases we utilize two suppliers one domestic and one international that meet our specifications rail is critical to our operations for rail replacement programs maintenance 

  

and for adding additional network capacity new rail and storage yards and expansions of existing facilities this industry similarly has high barriers to entry and if one of these suppliers discontinues operations for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience both significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail for maintenance and other projects 

we may be affected by acts of terrorism war or risk of war – our rail lines facilities and equipment including rail cars carrying hazardous materials could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks terrorist attacks or other similar events any government response thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in addition insurance premiums for some or all of our current coverages could increase dramatically or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future

 harriman dispatching center 

the harriman dispatching center hdc located in omaha nebraska is our primary dispatching facility it is linked to regional dispatching and locomotive management facilities at various locations along our network hdc employees coordinate moves of locomotives and trains manage traffic and train crews on our network and coordinate interchanges with other railroads approximately 900 employees currently work onsite in the facility 

rail facilities 

in addition to our track structure we operate numerous facilities including terminals for intermodal and other freight rail yards for trainbuilding classification yards switching storageintransit the temporary storage of customer goods in rail cars prior to shipment and other activities offices to administer and manage our operations dispatching centers to direct traffic on our rail network crew quarters to house train crews along our network and shops and other facilities for fueling maintenance and repair of locomotives and repair and maintenance of rail cars and other equipment the following tables include the major yards and terminals on our system 

 

   

 rail equipment 

our equipment includes owned and leased locomotives and rail cars heavy maintenance equipment and machinery other equipment and tools in our shops offices and facilities and vehicles for maintenance transportation of crews and other activities as of december 31 2010 we owned or leased the following units of equipment 

 

 capital expenditures 

our rail network requires significant annual capital investments for replacement improvement and expansion these investments enhance safety support the transportation needs of our customers and improve our operational efficiency additionally we add new locomotives and freight cars to our fleet to replace older less efficient equipment to support growth and customer demand and to reduce our impact on the environment through the acquisition of more fuel efficient and lowemission locomotives 

2010 capital expenditures – during 2010 we made capital investments totaling 25 billion nearly all of which was cash spending see the capital expenditures table in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources – financial condition item 7 

  

infrastructure expansion – with expected longterm growth in the intermodal market we commenced construction of a new intermodal terminal in joliet illinois in the spring of 2009 and completed the initial phase in august 2010 this new facility supports customer growth by increasing the railroad’s international and domestic container capacity and improving rail traffic efficiencies in chicago the nation’s largest rail center customers across our network benefit from the joliet facility’s annual capacity of 500000 intermodal containers 

2011 capital expenditures – in 2011 we expect to make capital investments of approximately 32 billion including expenditures for ptc of approximately 250 million we may revise our 2011 capital plan if business conditions warrant or if new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments see discussion of our 2011 capital plan in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – 2011 outlook item 7 

other 

equipment encumbrance – equipment with a carrying value of approximately 32 billion and 34 billion at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively served as collateral for capital leases and other types of equipment obligations in accordance with the secured financing arrangements utilized to acquire such railroad equipment 

as a result of the merger of missouri pacific railroad company mprr with and into uprr on january 1 1997 and pursuant to the underlying indentures for the mprr mortgage bonds uprr must maintain the same value of assets after the merger in order to comply with the security requirements of the mortgage bonds as of the merger date the value of the mprr assets that secured the mortgage bonds was approximately 60 billion in accordance with the terms of the indentures this collateral value must be maintained during the entire term of the mortgage bonds irrespective of the outstanding balance of such bonds 

environmental matters – certain of our properties are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment see discussion of environmental issues in business – governmental and environmental regulation item 1 and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies – environmental item 7 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation that occur in connection with our business we routinely assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest available information and when necessary we seek input from our thirdparty advisors when making these assessments consistent with sec rules and requirements we describe below material pending legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities other proceedings arising under federal state or local environmental laws and regulations including governmental proceedings involving potential fines penalties or other monetary sanctions in excess of 100000 and such other pending matters that we may determine to be appropriate 

environmental matters 

as we reported in our annual report on form 10k for 2005 the environmental protection agency epa considers the railroad a potentially responsible party for the omaha lead site the omaha lead site consists of approximately 25 square miles of residential property in the eastern part of omaha nebraska allegedly impacted by air emissions from two former lead smeltersrefineries one refinery was operated by asarco the epa identified the railroad as a potentially responsible party because more than 60 years ago the railroad owned land that was leased to asarco the railroad disputes both the legal and technical basis of the epa’s allegations it has nonetheless engaged in extensive negotiations with the epa the epa issued a unilateral administrative order with an effective date of december 16 2005 directing the railroad to implement an interim remedy at the site at an estimated cost of 50 million failure to comply with the order without just cause could subject the railroad to penalties of up to 37500 per day and triple the epa’s costs in performing the work the railroad believes it has just cause not to comply with the order but it offered to perform some of the work specified in the order as a compromise on august 5 2009 the railroad received a special notice letter from epa directing uprr 

  

to perform environmental remediation at approximately 9000 residential yards in omaha and to take other remedial measures as part of a final remedy the railroad continues to contest its purported liability for these costs but has submitted an offer to the epa to attempt to negotiate a resolution of the matter on june 23 2010 the railroad filed suit in federal district court in omaha nebraska against the epa and its administrator under the freedom of information act foia the administrative procedure act and the federal records act asking the court to compel epa to respond fully to outstanding foia requests and to prevent epa from destroying records the court granted the railroad a temporary restraining order prohibiting further document destruction on august 26 2010 the court entered an agreed preliminary injunction preventing destruction of records by epa in november 2010 the railroad reached a tentative confidential settlement agreement subject to further negotiation to resolve its liability at the omaha lead site the foia litigation has been stayed pending possible resolution of the case 

as we reported in our annual report on form 10k for 2005 the illinois attorney general’s office filed a complaint against the railroad in the circuit court for the twentieth judicial circuit st clair county for injunctive and other relief on november 28 2005 alleging a diesel fuel spill from an aboveground storage tank in a rail yard in dupo st clair county illinois the state of illinois seeks to enjoin uprr from further violations and a monetary penalty the amount of the proposed penalty although uncertain could exceed 100000 

as we reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended march 31 2010 we received notices from epa region 8 and us department of justice doj alleging that we may be liable under federal environmental laws for violating the clean water act and the oil pollution prevention act relating to derailments and spills and uprr’s spill prevention countermeasure and control plans and its stormwater pollution prevention plans in colorado utah and wyoming we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings because we are continuing to investigate and negotiate with the epa region 8 and doj the amount of the proposed penalty although uncertain could exceed 100000 

we received notices from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are or may be liable under federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the us including sites on the superfund national priorities list or state superfund lists we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings and suits because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs 

information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies – environmental item 7 

other matters 

us customs and border protection cbp dispute and litigation – as we reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2010 cbp directed its field offices to issue penalties against the railroad in december 2007 for discoveries of illegal drugs in railcars crossing the border from mexico the cars are in trains delivered by mexican railroads directly to cbp the railroad receives the trains only after cbp inspects them additionally cbp imposed or reinstated earlier penalties that had been held in abeyance while the railroad and cbp pursued a collective plan to address drug smuggling in some instances cbp seized railcars in which drugs were found 

on july 31 2008 the railroad filed a complaint in the us district court for the district of nebraska asking the court to enter 1 a judgment declaring that cbp’s penalties and seizures are invalid and unenforceable and 2 preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting cbp from enforcing penalties and holding seized cars and directing cbp to refrain from issuing additional penalties and from future equipment seizures the total amount of penalties assessed against the railroad at that time was approximately 614 million the parties discussed settlement and the case in the district court was stayed during this period no new penalties were issued and no cars were seized 

settlement discussions were unsuccessful as a result the railroad reinstituted its lawsuit on february 18 2009 us department of justice doj then filed enforcement actions in the us district court for the southern district of texas on march 17 2009 and in the us district court for the southern district of california on march 18 2009 and nine separate forfeiture complaints in the us district court for the district of arizona on march 19 2009 covering ten seized cars 

  

the railroad is awaiting a decision on its motion for summary judgment from the nebraska court the railroad also filed motions in california texas and arizona to transfer to nebraska dismiss or stay the cases in those courts the california and texas courts granted up’s motion to transfer venue to nebraska the arizona court has not issued a ruling 

during the third quarter of 2010 cbp notified the railroad of additional penalties for drug discoveries since then the railroad received additional penalties for other drug discoveries the total outstanding penalty amount as of december 31 2010 was approximately 376 million because the railroad believes that cbp lacks statutory authority to issue these fines the railroad will vigorously defend against these penalties the railroad also is participating in highlevel discussions with the commissioner of cbp to address the fines and seizures therefore we currently believe that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on any of our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

antitrust litigation – as we reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2007 20 small rail shippers many of whom are represented by the same law firms filed virtually identical antitrust lawsuits in various federal district courts against us and four other class i railroads in the us the original plaintiff filed the first of these claims in the us district court in new jersey on may 14 2007 and the additional plaintiffs filed claims in district courts in various states including florida illinois alabama pennsylvania and the district of columbia these suits allege that the named railroads engaged in pricefixing by establishing common fuel surcharges for certain rail traffic 

we received additional complaints following the initial claim increasing the total number of complaints to 30 in addition to suits filed by direct purchasers of rail transportation a few of the suits involve plaintiffs alleging that they are or were indirect purchasers of rail transportation and seek to represent a purported class of indirect purchasers of rail transportation that paid fuel surcharges these complaints added allegations under state antitrust and consumer protection laws on november 6 2007 the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation ordered that all of the rail fuel surcharge cases be transferred to judge paul friedman of the us district court in the district of columbia for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings subsequently the direct purchaser plaintiffs and the indirect purchaser plaintiffs filed consolidated amended class action complaints against uprr and three other class i railroads 

one additional shipper filed a separate antitrust suit during 2008 subsequently the shipper voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice 

on october 10 2008 judge friedman heard oral arguments with respect to the defendant railroads’ motions to dismiss in a ruling on november 7 2008 judge friedman denied the motion with respect to the direct purchasers’ complaint and pretrial proceedings are underway in that case on december 31 2008 judge friedman ruled that the allegations of the indirect purchasers based upon state antitrust consumer protection and unjust enrichment laws must be dismissed he also ruled however that the plaintiffs could proceed with their claim for injunctive relief under the federal antitrust laws which is identical to a claim by the direct purchaser plaintiffs 

the indirect purchasers appealed judge friedman’s ruling to the us court of appeals for the district of columbia on april 16 2010 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia affirmed judge friedman’s ruling dismissing the indirect purchasers’ claims based on various state laws on june 8 2010 the court rejected the indirect purchasers’ requests for a rehearing of their appeal and a hearing en banc by the entire court on september 8 2010 the indirect purchaser plaintiffs filed a petition for certiorari with the us supreme court the railroad defendants filed their response on november 9 2010 urging the court not to review the lower courts’ decisions on december 13 2010 the us supreme court denied the indirect purchaser plaintiffs’ petition for certiorari 

the direct purchaser plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification on march 18 2010 the railroad defendants filed their opposition to this motion on july 1 2010 judge friedman conducted a hearing on october 6 and 7 2010 on the class certification issue and has yet to issue a decision 

we deny the allegations that our fuel surcharge programs violate the antitrust laws or any other laws we believe that these lawsuits are without merit and we will vigorously defend our actions therefore we currently believe that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on any of our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

 results of operations 

operating revenues 

 

 freight revenues are revenues generated by transporting freight or other materials from our six commodity groups freight revenues vary with volume carloads and average revenue per car arc changes in price traffic mix and fuel surcharges drive arc we provide some of our customers with contractual incentives for meeting or exceeding specified cumulative volumes or shipping to and from specific locations which we record as a reduction to freight revenues based on the actual or projected future shipments we recognize freight revenues as freight moves from origin to destination we allocate freight revenues between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them 

other revenues include revenues earned by our subsidiaries revenues from our commuter rail operations and accessorial revenues which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us or when we perform additional services such as switching or storage we recognize other revenues as we perform services or meet contractual obligations 

freight revenues and volume levels for all six commodity groups increased during 2010 as a result of economic improvement in many market sectors we experienced particularly strong volume growth in automotive intermodal and industrial products shipments core pricing gains and higher fuel surcharges also increased freight revenues and drove a 6 improvement in arc 

freight revenues and volume levels for all six commodity groups decreased during 2009 reflecting continued economic weakness we experienced the largest volume declines in automotive and industrial 

  

products shipments lower fuel surcharges due to lower fuel prices also reduced freight revenues in 2009 compared to 2008 arc decreased 7 during the full year driven by lower fuel cost recoveries partially offset by core pricing gains of approximately 5 fuel cost recoveries include fuel surcharge revenue and the impact of resetting the base fuel price for certain traffic which is described below in more detail 

our fuel surcharge programs excluding indexbased contract escalators that contain some provision for fuel generated freight revenues of 12 billion 605 million and 23 billion in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively higher fuel prices volume growth and new fuel surcharge provisions in contracts renegotiated during the year increased fuel surcharge amounts in 2010 furthermore for certain periods during 2009 fuel prices dropped below the base at which our mileagebased fuel surcharge begins which resulted in no fuel surcharge recovery for associated shipments during those periods 

fuel surcharge revenue is not entirely comparable to prior periods due to implementation of new mileagebased fuel surcharge programs in april 2007 we converted regulated traffic which represents approximately 20 of our current revenue base to mileagebased fuel surcharge programs in addition we have converted and continue to convert portions of our nonregulated traffic to mileagebased fuel surcharge programs at the time of conversion we reset the base fuel price at which the new mileagebased fuel surcharges take effect resetting the fuel price at which the fuel surcharge begins in conjunction with rebasing the affected transportation rates to include a portion of what had been in the fuel surcharge does not materially change our freight revenue as higher base rates offset lower fuel surcharge revenue 

in 2010 other revenues increased from 2009 due primarily to higher revenues at our subsidiaries that broker intermodal and automotive services assessorial revenues also increased in 2010 reflecting higher volume levels during the year 

in 2009 other revenue decreased from 2008 due primarily to lower revenues at one of our subsidiaries that brokers intermodal and automotive services assessorial revenues also decreased in 2009 reflecting lower volume levels during the year 

the following tables summarize the yearoveryear changes in freight revenues revenue carloads each container or trailer is counted as one carload and arc by commodity type 

 

   

  

 lower volume and fuel surcharges decreased agricultural freight revenue in 2009 versus 2008 price improvements partially offset these declines lower demand in both export and domestic markets led to fewer shipments of corn and feed grains down 11 in 2009 compared to 2008 weaker worldwide demand also reduced export shipments of wheat and food grains in 2009 versus 2008 

 

   

  

 lower volume and fuel surcharges reduced freight revenue from energy shipments in 2009 versus 2008 price increases partially offset these declines shipments curtailments and delayed purchases combined to reduce fertilizer shipments by 29 in 2009 additionally business interruptions resulting from hurricanes gustav and ike lowered volume levels in the third quarter of 2008 contributing to a more favorable yearoveryear comparison tility customers resulting in lower volumes production problems at the colorado and utah mines and the loss of sprb customer contracts also contributed to the volume declines 

  

 decreased volumes and fuel surcharges reduced freight revenue from intermodal shipments in 2009 versus 2008 volume from international traffic decreased 24 in 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting economic conditions continued weak imports from asia and diversions to nonuprr served ports additionally continued weakness in the domestic housing and automotive sectors translated into weak demand in large sectors of the international intermodal market which also contributed to the volume decline conversely domestic traffic increased 8 in 2009 compared to 2008 a new contract with hub group inc which included additional shipments was executed in the second quarter of 2009 and more than offset the impact of weak market conditions in the second half of 2009 

mexico business – each of our commodity groups include revenue from shipments to and from mexico revenue from mexico business increased 30 in 2010 versus 2009 to 16 billion volume levels for all six commodity groups increased up 25 in aggregate versus 2009 with particularly strong growth in automotive industrial products and intermodal shipments 

revenue from mexico business decreased 26 in 2009 versus 2008 to 12 billion volume declined in five of our six commodity groups down 19 in 2009 driven by 32 and 24 reductions in industrial products and automotive shipments respectively conversely energy shipments increased 9 in 2009 versus 2008 partially offsetting these declines 

  

operating expenses 

 

 

 

  

 compensation and benefits – compensation and benefits include wages payroll taxes health and welfare costs pension costs other postretirement benefits and incentive costs general wage and benefit inflation increased costs by approximately 190 million in 2010 compared to 2009 volumerelated expenses and higher equity and incentive compensation also drove costs up during the year workforce levels declined 1 in 2010 compared to 2009 as network efficiencies and ongoing productivity initiatives enabled us to effectively handle the 13 increase in volume levels with fewer employees 

lower volume and productivity initiatives led to a 10 decline in our workforce in 2009 compared to 2008 saving 516 million during the year conversely general wage and benefit inflation increased expenses partially offsetting these savings 

fuel – fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and nonhighway vehicles and heavy equipment higher diesel fuel prices which averaged 229 per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in 2010 compared to 175 per gallon in 2009 increased expenses by 566 million volume as measured by gross tonmiles increased 10 in 2010 versus 2009 driving fuel expense up by 166 million conversely the use of newer more fuel efficient locomotives our fuel conservation programs and efficient network operations drove a 3 improvement in our fuel consumption rate in 2010 resulting in 40 million of cost savings versus 2009 at the 2009 average fuel price 

lower diesel fuel prices which averaged 175 per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in 2009 compared to 315 per gallon in 2008 reduced expenses by 13 billion in 2009 volume as measured by gross tonmiles decreased 17 in 2009 lowering expenses by 664 million compared to 2008 our fuel consumption rate improved 4 in 2009 resulting in 147 million of cost savings versus 2008 at the 2008 average fuel price the consumption rate savings versus 2008 using the lower 2009 fuel price was 68 million newer more fuel efficient locomotives reflecting locomotive acquisitions in recent years and the impact of a smaller fleet due to storage of some of our older locomotives increased use of 

  

distributed locomotive power our fuel conservation programs and improved network operations all drove this improvement 

purchased services and materials – purchased services and materials expense includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors including equipment maintenance and contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services materials used to maintain the railroad’s lines structures and equipment costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other railroads transportation and lodging for train crew employees trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers leased automobile maintenance expenses and tools and supplies a 148 million increase in expenses for contract services drove the higher expenses in 2010 versus 2009 volumerelated trucking and lift costs for intermodal containers and crew transportation and lodging costs also increased costs from 2009 in addition an increase in locomotive maintenance materials used to prepare a portion of our locomotive fleet for return to active service increased expenses during the year compared to 2009 conversely a decrease in freight car maintenance activity during 2010 drove lower freight car material costs partially offsetting the cost increases versus 2009 

contract services expense including equipment maintenance decreased 134 million in 2009 versus 2008 due to lower volume levels and a favorable yearoveryear comparison due to expenses incurred in 2008 resulting from hurricanes gustav and ike in addition lower volume levels drove cost reductions of 55 million in transportation and lodging costs and 27 million in expenses associated with operating jointly owned facilities in 2009 versus 2008 we also performed fewer locomotive and freight car repairs as a result of lower volumes and having portions of these fleets stored which reduced related materials expenses by 87 million in 2009 versus 2008 cleanup and restoration expenses related to the cascade mudslide in january flooding in the midwest in june and the two september hurricanes also increased expenses in 2008 creating a favorable yearoveryear comparison 

depreciation – the majority of depreciation relates to road property including rail ties ballast and other track material a higher depreciable asset base reflecting higher capital spending in recent years increased depreciation expense in 2010 compared to 2009 costs also increased 25 million in 2010 due to the restructuring of certain locomotive leases in the second quarter of 2009 lower depreciation rates for rail and other track material partially offset the increases the lower rates which became effective january 1 2010 resulted from reduced track usage based on lower gross tonmiles in 2009 

a higher depreciable asset base reflecting higher capital spending in recent years increased depreciation expense in 2009 versus 2008 costs also increased 34 million in 2009 due to the restructuring of certain locomotive leases lower depreciation rates for rail and other track material partially offset the increases the lower rates which became effective january 1 2009 resulted from longer asset lives as determined by service life studies and reduced track usage based on lower gross tonmiles in 2008 

equipment and other rents – equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies freight car intermodal and locomotive leases other specialty equipment leases and office and other rentals shortterm freight car rental expense increased in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting increased shipments of finished vehicles and intermodal containers increased lease expenses for containers also drove the increase conversely lower lease expense for freight cars and locomotives decreased costs compared to 2009 the restructuring of locomotive leases completed in may 2009 also reduced lease expense by 36 million in 2010 compared to 2009 see further discussion in this item 7 under liquidity and capital resources – financing activities 

fewer shipments of industrial products and intermodal containers primarily contributed to the 85 million reduction in our shortterm freight car rental expense in 2009 versus 2008 in addition the restructuring of locomotive leases reduced lease expense by 52 million in 2009 compared to 2008 lower lease expense for freight cars intermodal containers and fleet vehicles also decreased costs in 2009 versus 2008 

other – other expenses include personal injury freight and property damage destruction of foreign equipment insurance environmental bad debt state and local taxes utilities telephone and cellular employee travel computer software and other general expenses other costs were higher in 2010 compared to 2009 driven by higher property taxes and the 45 million onetime payment in the first quarter of 2010 related to a transaction with csxi a 30 million payment in 2009 to pacer international 

  

inc and lower expenses for freight and property damages partially offset these increases in comparing 2009 with 2010 in addition personal injury expense was lower in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting continued improvement in our personal injury incident rate and lower settlement costs per claim the change in asbestosrelated claim expenses in 2010 versus 2009 offset the lower personal injury costs as a result of our 2009 annual review of asbestosrelated costs we reduced expenses by 25 million thus driving the unfavorable variance in 2010 

other costs were lower in 2009 compared to 2008 driven by a reduction in personal injury expense and asbestosrelated claims expense we completed actuarial studies of personal injury expenses in both the second and fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008 and annual reviews of asbestosrelated claims in both years which resulted in a net reduction of 55 million in casualty expense in 2009 versus 2008 the reduction reflects improvements in our safety experience and lower estimated costs to resolve claims in addition the yearoveryear comparison was favorably impacted by 28 million due to an adverse development with respect to one personal injury claim in 2008 and favorable developments in three cases in 2009 other costs were also lower in 2009 compared to 2008 driven by a decrease in expenses for freight and property damages employee travel and utilities in addition higher bad debt expense in 2008 due to the uncertain impact of the recessionary economy drove a favorable yearoveryear comparison conversely an additional expense of 30 million related to a transaction with pacer international inc and higher property taxes partially offset lower costs in 2009 

nonoperating items 

 

 

 

 other income – other income decreased in 2010 versus 2009 due to lower gains from real estate sales the second quarter of 2009 included a 116 million pretax gain from a land sale to the regional transportation district in colorado and premiums paid for early debt redemption 

other income increased 103 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to higher gains from real estate sales which included the 116 million pretax gain from a land sale in colorado and lower interest expense on our receivables securitization facility resulting from lower interest rates and a lower outstanding balance reduced rental and licensing income and lower returns on cash investments reflecting lower interest rates partially offset these increases 

interest expense – interest expense was flat in 2010 compared to 2009 due to a modestly higher weightedaverage debt level of 97 billion compared to 96 billion in 2009 offset by a lower effective interest rate of 62 in 2010 compared to 63 in 2009 

interest expense increased in 2009 versus 2008 due primarily to higher weightedaverage debt levels in 2009 the weightedaverage debt level was 96 billion including the restructuring of locomotive leases in may of 2009 compared to 83 billion in 2008 our effective interest rate was 63 in 2009 compared to 61 in 2008 

income taxes – income taxes were higher in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily driven by higher pretax income our effective tax rate for the year was 373 compared to 364 in 2009 income taxes were lower in 2009 compared to 2008 driven by lower pretax income our effective tax rate for 2009 was 364 compared to 360 in 2008 

other operatingperformance and financial statistics 

we report key railroad performance measures weekly to the association of american railroads aar including carloads average daily inventory of rail cars on our system average train speed and average terminal dwell time we provide this data on our website at wwwupcominvestorsreportsindexshtml 

  

operatingperformance statistics 

railroad performance measures reported to the aar as well as other performance measures are included in the table below 

 

 

 

 average train speed – average train speed is calculated by dividing train miles by hours operated on our main lines between terminals maintenance activities and weather disruptions combined with higher volume levels led to a 4 decrease in average train speed in 2010 compared to a record set in 2009 overall we continued operating a fluid and efficient network during the year lower volume levels ongoing network management initiatives and productivity improvements contributed to a 16 improvement in average train speed in 2009 compared to 2008 

average terminal dwell time – average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our terminals lower average terminal dwell time improves asset utilization and service average terminal dwell time increased 2 in 2010 compared to 2009 driven in part by our network plan to increase the length of numerous trains to improve overall efficiency which resulted in higher terminal dwell time for some cars average terminal dwell time improved slightly in 2009 compared to 2008 due to lower volume levels combined with initiatives to expedite delivering rail cars to our interchange partners and customers 

average rail car inventory – average rail car inventory is the daily average number of rail cars on our lines including rail cars in storage lower average rail car inventory reduces congestion in our yards and sidings which increases train speed reduces average terminal dwell time and improves rail car utilization average rail car inventory decreased 3 in 2010 compared to 2009 while we handled 13 increases in carloads during the period compared to 2009 we maintained more freight cars offline and retired a number of old freight cars which drove the decreases average rail car inventory decreased 6 in 2009 compared to 2008 driven by a 16 decrease in volume in addition as carloads decreased we stored more freight cars offline 

gross and revenue tonmiles – gross tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled revenue tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles gross and revenuetonmiles increased 10 and 9 in 2010 compared to 2009 due to a 13 increase in carloads commodity mix changes notably automotive shipments drove the variance in yearoveryear growth between gross tonmiles revenue tonmiles and carloads gross and revenue tonmiles decreased 17 and 15 in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a 16 decrease in carloads commodity mix changes notably automotive shipments which were 30 lower in 2009 versus 2008 drove the difference in declines between gross tonmiles and revenue tonmiles 

operating ratio – operating ratio is defined as our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue our operating ratio improved 55 points to 706 in 2010 and 13 points to 761 in 2009 efficiently leveraging volume increases core pricing gains and productivity initiatives drove the improvement in 2010 and more than offset the impact of higher fuel prices during the year core pricing gains lower fuel prices network management initiatives and improved productivity drove the improvement in 2009 and more than offset the 16 volume decline 

employees – employee levels were down 1 in 2010 compared to 2009 despite a 13 increase in volume levels we leveraged the additional volumes through network efficiencies and other productivity initiatives in addition we successfully managed the growth of our fulltimeequivalent train and engine force levels at a rate less than half of our carload growth in 2010 all other operating functions and 

  

support organizations reduced their fulltimeequivalent force levels benefiting from continued productivity initiatives productivity initiatives and lower volumes reduced employee levels 10 throughout the company in 2009 versus 2008 

customer satisfaction index – our customer satisfaction survey asks customers to rate how satisfied they are with our performance over the last 12 months on a variety of attributes a higher score indicates higher customer satisfaction the improvement in survey results in 2010 and 2009 generally reflects customer recognition of our service quality 

return on average common shareholders’ equity 

 

 

 

 return on invested capital as adjusted roic 

 

 

 

 roic is considered a nongaap financial measure by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe this measure is important in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the corporation’s longterm capital investments in addition we currently use roic as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of equity compensation for our executives roic should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for other information provided in accordance with gaap the most comparable gaap measure is return on average common shareholders’ equity the tables above provide reconciliations from return on average common shareholders’ equity to roic our 2010 roic improved 26 points compared to 2009 primarily as a result of higher earnings 

  

debt to capital  adjusted debt to capital 

 

 

 adjusted debt to capital is a nongaap financial measure under sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk we believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the total amount of leverage in our capital structure including offbalance sheet lease obligations which we generally incur in connection with financing the acquisition of locomotives and freight cars and certain facilities effective january 1 2010 the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under our receivables securitization facility is included in our consolidated statement of financial position as debt due after one year at december 31 2010 that amount was 100 million operating leases were discounted using 62 at december 31 2010 and 63 at december 31 2009 the lower discount rate reflects changes to interest rates and our current financing costs we monitor the ratio of adjusted debt to capital as we manage our capital structure to balance costeffective and efficient access to the capital markets with the corporation’s overall cost of capital adjusted debt to capital should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for debt to capital the tables above provide reconciliations from debt to capital to adjusted debt to capital our december 31 2010 debt to capital ratios decreased as a result of a 606 million net decrease in debt from december 31 2009 debt including the value of our receivables securitization facility decreased 10 billion from december 31 2009 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2010 our principal sources of liquidity included cash cash equivalents our receivables securitization facility and our revolving credit facility as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets such as the remaining authority under our shelf registration we had 19 billion of committed credit available under our credit facility with no borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2010 we did not make any borrowings under this facility during 2010 the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the receivables securitization facility was 100 million as of december 31 2010 and is included in our consolidated statements of financial position as debt due after one year the receivables securitization facility is subject to certain requirements including maintenance of an investment grade bond rating if our bond rating were to deteriorate it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financings is dependent on market conditions deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability we expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity by issuing bonds to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets 

at december 31 2010 and 2009 we had a working capital surplus which in 2010 continues to be the result of our decision in 2009 to maintain additional cash reserves to enhance liquidity in response to 

  

uncertain economic conditions historically we have had a working capital deficit which is common in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity we maintain adequate resources and when necessary have access to capital to meet any daily and shortterm cash requirements and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

 

 operating activities 

higher net income in 2010 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2009 conversely the adoption of a new accounting standard for our receivables securitization facility from a sale of undivided interests recorded as an operating activity to a secured borrowing recorded as a financing activity decreased cash provided by operating activities by 400 million in 2010 versus 184 million in 2009 lower net income in 2009 a reduction of 184 million in the outstanding balance of our receivables securitization facility higher pension contributions of 72 million and changes to working capital combined to decrease cash provided by operating activities compared to 2008 

investing activities 

higher capital investments and lower proceeds from asset sales in 2010 drove the increase in cash used in investing activities compared to 2009 lower capital investments and higher proceeds from asset sales drove the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2009 versus 2008 

the tables below detail cash capital investments and track statistics for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 

  

  

 capital plan – in 2011 we expect our total capital investments to be approximately 32 billion which may be revised if business conditions warrant or if new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments we expect that approximately 65 of our 2011 capital 

  

investments will replace and improve existing capital assets major investment categories include replacing and improving track infrastructure increasing network and terminal capacity upgrading our locomotive freight car and container fleet including acquiring 100 locomotives 600 covered hoppers 4800 containers and 4800 chassis improving technology including investing in ptc and other capital projects we expect to fund our 2011 cash capital investments through cash generated from operations the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties issuance of longterm debt and cash on hand at december 31 2010 our annual capital plan is a critical component of our longterm strategic plan which we expect will enhance the longterm value of the corporation for our shareholders by providing sufficient resources to i replace and improve our existing track infrastructure to provide safe and fluid operations ii increase network efficiency by adding or improving facilities and track and iii make investments that meet customer demand and take advantage of opportunities for longterm growth 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities increased in 2010 versus 2009 during 2010 we repurchased 12 billion of shares under our common stock repurchase program compared to no repurchases in 2009 additionally our net debt reduction in 2010 was 518 million compared to 28 million in 2009 which also contributed to the increase in cash used in financing activities in 2010 cash used in financing activities decreased in 2009 versus 2008 driven by share repurchases totaling 16 billion in 2008 additionally debt repayments were 337 million lower in 2009 partially offset by lower new debt issuances of 14 billion and higher dividend payments we increased our dividend from 022 per share to 027 per share effective in the third quarter of 2008 the restructuring of equipment leases in 2009 also generated 87 million in cash consideration further contributing to the decrease 

credit facilities – on december 31 2010 we had 19 billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility the facility the facility is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper we did not draw on the facility during 2010 commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investmentgrade borrowers the facility allows borrowings at floating rates based on london interbank offered rates plus a spread depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings the facility requires union pacific corporation to maintain a debttonetworth coverage ratio as a condition to making a borrowing at december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 and at all times during these periods we were in compliance with this covenant 

the definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the debttonetworth coverage ratio includes among other things certain credit arrangements capital leases guarantees and unfunded and vested pension benefits under title iv of erisa at december 31 2010 the debttonetworth coverage ratio allowed us to carry up to 355 billion of debt as defined in the facility and we had 97 billion of debt as defined in the facility outstanding at that date under our current capital plans we expect to continue to satisfy the debttonetworth coverage ratio however many factors beyond our reasonable control including the risk factors in item 1a of this report could affect our ability to comply with this provision in the future the facility does not include any other financial restrictions credit rating triggers other than ratingdependent pricing or any other provision that could require us to post collateral the facility also includes a 75 million crossdefault provision and a changeofcontrol provision the facility will expire in april 2012 in accordance with its terms and we currently intend to replace the facility with a substantially similar credit agreement on or before the expiration date which is consistent with our past practices with respect to our credit facilities 

during 2010 we did not issue or repay any commercial paper and at december 31 2010 we had no commercial paper outstanding our commercial paper balance is supported by our revolving credit facility but does not reduce the amount of borrowings available under the facility 

at december 31 2010 we reclassified as longterm debt approximately 100 million of debt due within one year that we intend to refinance this reclassification reflected our ability and intent to refinance any shortterm borrowings and certain current maturities of longterm debt on a longterm basis at december 31 2009 we reclassified as longterm debt approximately 320 million of debt due within one year that we intended to refinance at that time 

  

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

for each of the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 69 49 and 59 respectively the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis earnings represent income from continuing operations less equity earnings net of distributions plus fixed charges and income taxes fixed charges represent interest charges amortization of debt discount and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges see exhibit 12 to this report for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

common shareholders’ equity 

dividend restrictions – our revolving credit facility includes a debttonet worth covenant discussed in the credit facilities section above that under certain circumstances restricts the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders the amount of retained earnings available for dividends was 129 billion and 116 billion at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

share repurchase program – on may 1 2008 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of 40 million common shares by march 31 2011 management’s assessments of market conditions and other pertinent facts guide the timing and volume of all repurchases any share repurchases under this program are expected to be funded through cash generated from operations the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties debt issuances and cash on hand repurchased shares are recorded in treasury stock at cost which includes any applicable commissions and fees 

 

 

 on february 3 2011 our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to 40 million additional shares of our common stock under a new program effective from april 1 2011 through march 31 2014 

shelf registration statement and significant new borrowings – we filed a shelf registration statement which became effective upon filing on february 10 2010 our board of directors authorized the issuance of up to 3 billion of debt securities replacing the 225 billion of authority remaining under our shelf registration filed in march 2007 under the shelf registration we may issue from time to time any combination of debt securities preferred stock common stock or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings 

during 2010 we issued the following unsecured fixedrate debt securities under our current shelf registration 

 

 the net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes including the repurchase of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program these debt securities include changeofcontrol provisions 

we have no immediate plans to issue equity securities however we will continue to explore opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under our shelf registration and therefore we may issue additional debt securities at any time at december 31 2010 we had remaining authority to issue up to 25 billion of debt securities under our shelf registration 

  

debt exchange – on july 14 2010 we exchanged 376 million of 7875 notes due in 2019 existing notes for 578 notes new notes due july 15 2040 plus cash consideration of approximately 96 million and 15 million for accrued and unpaid interest on the existing notes the cash consideration recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of debt and the balance of the unamortized discount and issue costs from the existing notes are being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the term of the new notes no gain or loss was recognized as a result of the exchange costs related to the debt exchange that were payable to parties other than the debt holders totaled approximately 2 million and were included in interest expense during the third quarter 

debt redemptions – on march 22 2010 we redeemed 175 million of our 65 notes due april 15 2012 the redemption resulted in an early extinguishment charge of 16 million in the first quarter of 2010 on november 1 2010 we redeemed all 400 million of our outstanding 665 notes due january 15 2011 the redemption resulted in a 5 million early extinguishment charge 

receivables securitization facility – in june 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 200916 accounting for transfers of financial assets asu 200916 asu 200916 limits the circumstances in which transferred financial assets can be derecognized and requires enhanced disclosures regarding transfers of financial assets and a transferor’s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets we adopted the authoritative accounting standard on january 1 2010 as a result we no longer account for the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under our receivables securitization facility as a sale in addition transfers of receivables occurring on or after january 1 2010 are reflected as debt issued in our consolidated statements of cash flows and the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors at december 31 2010 is accounted for as a secured borrowing and is included in our consolidated statements of financial position as debt due after one year 

under the receivables securitization facility the railroad sells most of its accounts receivable to union pacific receivables inc upri a bankruptcyremote subsidiary upri may subsequently transfer without recourse on a 364day revolving basis an undivided interest in eligible accounts receivable to investors the total capacity to transfer undivided interests to investors under the facility was 600 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the facility was 100 million and 400 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively the value of the undivided interest held by investors was supported by 960 million and 817 million of accounts receivable at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively at december 31 2010 and 2009 the value of the interest retained by upri was 960 million and 417 million respectively this retained interest is included in accounts receivable net in our consolidated statements of financial position 

the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors could fluctuate based upon the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks including default and dilution if default or dilution ratios increase one percent the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would not change as of december 31 2010 should our credit rating fall below investment grade the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would be reduced and in certain cases the investors would have the right to discontinue the facility 

the railroad collected approximately 163 billion and 138 billion of receivables during the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively upri used certain of these proceeds to purchase new receivables under the facility 

the costs of the receivables securitization facility include interest which will vary based on prevailing commercial paper rates program fees paid to banks commercial paper issuing costs and fees for unused commitment availability the costs of the receivables securitization facility are included in interest expense and were 6 million during 2010 prior to adoption of the new accounting standard the costs of the receivables securitization facility were included in other income and were 9 million and 23 million for 2009 and 2008 respectively 

the investors have no recourse to the railroad’s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims creditors of the railroad do not have recourse to the assets of upri 

in august 2010 the receivables securitization facility was renewed for an additional 364day period at comparable terms and conditions 

  

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and as referenced in the tables below we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments including material sources of offbalance sheet and structured finance arrangements other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets as described in item 1a of part ii of this report there is no known trend demand commitment event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition our commercial obligations financings and commitments are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations particularly within the transportation industry 

the following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of december 31 2010 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

guarantees – at december 31 2010 we were contingently liable for 382 million in guarantees we have recorded a liability of 3 million for the fair value of these obligations as of december 31 2010 and 2009 we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business and they include guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building equipment financings and affiliated 

  

operations the final guarantee expires in 2022 we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

other matters 

inflation – long periods of inflation significantly increase asset replacement costs for capitalintensive companies as a result assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels depreciation charges on an inflationadjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 

derivative financial instruments – we may use derivative financial instruments in limited instances to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and fuel prices we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged both at inception and throughout the hedged period we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items at inception as well as our riskmanagement objectives strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness changes in the fair market value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are charged to earnings we may use swaps collars futures andor forward contracts to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in interest rates and fuel prices however the use of these derivative financial instruments may limit future benefits from favorable price movements 

market and credit risk – we address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item we manage credit risk related to derivative financial instruments which is minimal by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements at december 31 2010 and 2009 we were not required to provide collateral nor had we received collateral relating to our hedging activities 

determination of fair value – we determine the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or the present value of expected future cash flows 

sensitivity analyses – the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 

at december 31 2010 we had variablerate debt representing approximately 22 of our total debt if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2011 than our december 31 2010 variable rate which was approximately 09 our interest expense would increase by approximately 2 million this amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balances of our variablerate debt at december 31 2010 

market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2010 and amounts to an increase of approximately 824 million to the fair value of our debt at december 31 2010 we estimated the fair values of our fixedrate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 

interest rate fair value hedges – we manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period we generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings we employ derivatives primarily swaps as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix in addition we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixedrate debt securities 

swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt’s fair value attributable to the changes in interest rates we account for swaps as fair value hedges using the shortcut method as allowed by the derivatives and hedging topic of the fasb 

  

accounting standards codification asc therefore we do not record any ineffectiveness within our consolidated financial statements 

interest rate cash flow hedges – we report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affects earnings at december 31 2010 and 2009 we had reductions of 3 million recorded as an accumulated other comprehensive loss that is being amortized on a straightline basis through september 30 2014 as of december 31 2010 and 2009 we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding 

recently issued accounting pronouncements – in june 2009 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 200916 accounting for transfers of financial assets asu 200916 asu 200916 limits the circumstances in which transferred financial assets can be derecognized and requires enhanced disclosures regarding transfers of financial assets and a transferor’s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets we adopted the authoritative accounting standard on january 1 2010 as a result we no longer account for the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under our receivables securitization facility as a sale in addition transfers of receivables occurring on or after january 1 2010 are reflected as debt issued in our consolidated statements of cash flows and recognized as debt due after one year in our consolidated statements of financial position 

asserted and unasserted claims – various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries we cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity however to the extent possible where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated we have recorded a liability we do not expect that any known lawsuits claims environmental costs commitments contingent liabilities or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters 

indemnities  – our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements including certain tax indemnifications can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions 

climate change – although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item 1a of this report we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact however we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment including investments in new technologies using training programs to reduce fuel consumption and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 2 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 these critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 

personal injury – the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability including unasserted claims the federal employers’ liability act fela governs compensation for workrelated accidents under fela damages 

  

are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or outofcourt settlements we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 

our personal injury liability is discounted to present value using applicable us treasury rates approximately 88 of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 12 related to unasserted claims at december 31 2010 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 426 million to 464 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss is more probable than any other our personal injury liability activity was as follows 

 

 our personal injury claims activity was as follows 

 

 asbestos – we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other parties allege exposure to asbestos we assess our potential liability using a statistical analysis of resolution costs for asbestosrelated claims this liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing costs the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions 

 

  

  

  

 our liability for asbestosrelated claims is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments approximately 22 of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 78 related to unasserted claims at december 31 2010 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestosrelated claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 162 million to 178 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss is more probable than any other in conjunction with the liability update performed in 2010 we also reassessed estimated insurance recoveries we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2010 and 2009 our asbestosrelated liability activity was as follows 

 

   

our asbestosrelated claims activity was as follows 

 

 we believe that our estimates of liability for asbestosrelated claims and insurance recoveries are reasonable and probable the amounts recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts however future events such as the number of new claims to be filed each year average settlement costs and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts estimates also may vary in the future if strategies activities and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change federal and state laws governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimants and there are material changes with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants 

environmental – we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations we identified 294 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements this includes 31 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government 17 of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 

when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in our business we and our consultants perform environmental assessments on the property we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and we can reasonably estimate such costs we do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable at december 31 2010 approximately 5 of our environmental liability was discounted at 28 while approximately 12 of our environmental liability was discounted at 34 at december 31 2009 our environmental liability activity was as follows 

 

 our environmental site activity was as follows 

 

 the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties cost estimates are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and existing technology laws and regulations the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties sitespecific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs estimates of liability 

  

may vary over time due to changes in federal state and local laws governing environmental remediation current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

property and depreciation – our railroad operations are highly capital intensive and our large base of homogeneous networktype assets turns over on a continuous basis each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated service lives which are measured in years except for rail in highdensity traffic corridors ie all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment yard and switching tracks and electronic yards for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics use and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources not as singular items we currently have more than 60 depreciable asset classes and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology asset strategies or other factors 

we determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property by means of depreciation studies we perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets ie rail and other track material ties and ballast and other road property our depreciation studies take into account the following factors 

 

  

  

  

 for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track it has been our experience that the lives of rail in highdensity traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage ie the amount of weight carried over the rail the service lives also vary based on rail weight rail condition eg new or secondhand and rail type eg straight or curve our depreciation studies for rail in high density traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross tonmiles carried over the rail ie the weight of loaded and empty freight cars locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile rail in highdensity traffic corridors accounts for approximately 70 percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material based on the number of gross tonmiles carried over our rail in high density traffic corridors during 2010 the estimated service lives of the majority of this rail ranged from approximately 15 years to approximately 30 years for all other depreciable assets we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively 

estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to changes in physical use technology asset strategies and other factors that will have an impact on the retirement profiles of our assets we are not aware of any specific factors that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service lives of our assets actual use and retirement of our assets may vary from our current estimates which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future periods 

changes in estimated useful lives of our assets due to the results of our depreciation studies could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately 42 million if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were decreased by one year annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately 45 million our recent depreciation studies have resulted in changes in depreciation rates for some asset classes but did not significantly affect our annual depreciation expense 

  

under group depreciation the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using i inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ii the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate in addition we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies any deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets 

for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions i is unusual ii is material in amount and iii varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies during the last three fiscal years no gains or losses were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad properties a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations 

income taxes – we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns these expected future tax consequences are measured based on current tax law the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated future tax law changes such as a change in the corporate tax rate could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity for example a 1 increase in future income tax rates would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately 300 million 

when appropriate we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reflect that these tax assets may not be realized in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized based on management’s judgments using available evidence about future events in 2010 there is no valuation allowance because the deferred tax assets associated with the 2009 valuation allowance expired unrealized our total valuation allowance at december 31 2009 was 8 million 

at times we may claim tax benefits that may be challenged by a tax authority we recognize tax benefits only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement a liability for “unrecognized tax benefits” is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards 

pension and other postretirement benefits – we use an actuarial analysis to measure the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and medical and life insurance benefits opeb to eligible employees in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make several assumptions the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets for opeb the critical assumptions are the discount rate and health care cost trend rate 

we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually and selected assumptions are based on the following factors 

 

  

  

   

the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit for 2010 and the estimated impact on 2010 net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit relative to a change in those assumptions 

 

  

 the following table presents the net periodic pension and opeb costbenefit for the years ended december 31 

 

 our net periodic pension cost is expected to increase to approximately 79 million in 2011 from 51 million in 2010 the increase is driven by a decrease in the discount rate to 535 a decrease in our expected rate of return on plan assets to 75 and an increase in the amortization of actuarial losses from accumulated other comprehensive income we reduced our expected rate of return on plan assets to 75 in 2011 from 8 in 2010 to reflect our expected future returns on plan assets based on our current asset allocation strategy our net periodic opeb benefit is expected to decrease to approximately 4 million in 2011 from 14 million in 2010 the decrease in our net periodic opeb benefit is primarily driven by a decrease in the amortization of prior service credits from accumulated other comprehensive income

we may be affected by general economic conditions – prolonged severe adverse domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of financial and credit markets including the availability of short and 

  

longterm debt financing may affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are required to transport hazardous materials – federal laws require railroads including us to transport hazardous materials regardless of risk or potential exposure of loss any rail accident or other incident or accident on our network at our facilities or at the facilities of our customers involving the release of hazardous materials including toxic inhalation hazard or tih materials such as certain chlorine compounds could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury property damage and environmental penalties and remediation which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations – we rely on information technology in all aspects of our business if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if we are unable to implement new technology we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally if we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment we could experience a service interruption safety failure security breach or other operational difficulties which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we must manage fluctuating demand for our services and network capacity – if there is significant demand for our services that exceeds the designed capacity of our network we may experience network difficulties including congestion and reduced velocity that could compromise the level of service we provide to our customers this level of demand may also compound the impact of weather and weatherrelated events on our operations and velocity although we continue to improve our transportation plan add capacity and improve operations at our yards and other facilities we cannot be sure that these measures will fully or adequately address any service shortcomings resulting from demand exceeding our planned capacity we may experience other operational or service difficulties related to network capacity dramatic and unplanned increases or decreases of demand for rail service with respect to one or more of our commodity groups or other events that could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in the event that we experience significant reductions of demand for rail services with respect to one or more of our commodity groups we may experience increased costs associated with resizing our operations including higher unit operating costs and costs for the storage of locomotives rail cars and other equipment workforce adjustments and other related activities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we face competition from other railroads and other transportation providers – we face competition from other railroads motor carriers ships barges and pipelines in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service while we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation or legislation releasing motor carriers from their size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect the competitive environment in which we operate 

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures – as a railroad with a vast network we are exposed to severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods mudslides or landslides extreme temperatures and significant precipitation that may cause business interruptions including line outages on our rail network that can adversely affect our entire rail network and result in increased costs increased liabilities and decreased 

  

revenue which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations as the majority of our employees belong to labor unions and labor agreements – the us class i railroads are party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in among other things strikes work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers if unionized workers were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown or other employees were to become unionized we could experience a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could compromise our service reliability and significantly increase our costs for healthcare wages and other benefits which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures – as a railroad with operations in densely populated urban areas and other cities and a vast rail network we are exposed to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage environmental liability and other matters any material changes to litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving any or all of property damage personal injury and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to significant environmental laws and regulations – due to the nature of the railroad business our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waters handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and hazardous material or petroleum releases we generate and transport hazardous and nonhazardous waste in our operations and we did so in our former operations environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties leased properties and properties owned by third parties as well as to properties we currently own environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation we have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated or are strictly liable under these laws or regulations we could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we may be affected by climate change and market or regulatory responses to climate change – climate change including the impact of global warming could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gasses including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating costs restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that a use commodities that we carry to produce energy b use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry or c manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels including chemical producers farmers and food producers and automakers and other manufacturers significant cost increases government regulation or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns including for example the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers finally we could face 

  

increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change any of these factors individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

rising or elevated fuel costs and whether we are able to mitigate these costs with fuel surcharges could materially and adversely affect our business – fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses diesel fuel prices are subject to dramatic fluctuations and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results although we currently are able to recover a significant amount of our increased fuel expenses through revenue from fuel surcharges we cannot be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elevated fuel costs through surcharges future market conditions or legislative or regulatory activities could adversely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharges or adequately recover increased fuel costs through fuel surcharges international political and economic circumstances affect fuel prices and supplies weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity if a fuel supply shortage were to arise higher fuel prices could despite our fuel surcharge programs have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we utilize capital markets – due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate a safe and efficient railroad we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements we utilize longterm debt instruments bank financing and commercial paper from timetotime and we pledge certain of our receivables significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets including the credit markets or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to and significantly increase the cost of commercial paper and other financing sources including bank credit facilities and the issuance of longterm debt including corporate bonds a deterioration of our financial condition could result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade which could prohibit or restrict us from utilizing our current sale of receivables program or accessing external sources of short and longterm debt financing and significantly increase the costs associated with utilizing a sale of receivables program and issuing both commercial paper and longterm debt 

we are subject to legislative regulatory and legal developments involving taxes – taxes are a significant part of our expenses we are subject to us federal state and foreign income payroll property sales and use fuel and other types of taxes changes in tax rates enactment of new tax laws revisions of tax regulations and claims or litigation with taxing authorities could result in substantially higher taxes and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

the availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations – changes in demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to meet demand for rail service unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are dependent on certain key suppliers of locomotives and rail – due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry with respect to locomotive manufacturing therefore if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience significant cost increases and reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations additionally we utilize two suppliers of rail that meet our specifications rail is critical to our operations for rail replacement programs maintenance and for adding additional network capacity new rail and 

  

storage yards and expansions of existing facilities this industry similarly has high barriers to entry and if one of these suppliers discontinues operations for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience both significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail for maintenance and other projects 

we may be affected by acts of terrorism war or risk of war – our rail lines facilities and equipment including rail cars carrying hazardous materials could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks terrorist attacks or other similar events any government response thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in addition insurance premiums for some or all of our current coverages could increase dramatically or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future

 item 2 properties 

we employ a variety of assets in the management and operation of our rail business our rail network covers 23 states in the western twothirds of the us 

  

track – our rail network includes approximately 32094 route miles we own 26223 miles and operate on the remainder pursuant to trackage rights or leases the following table describes track miles at december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

 harriman dispatching center – the harriman dispatching center hdc located in omaha nebraska is our primary dispatching facility it is linked to regional dispatching and locomotive management facilities at various locations along our network the hdc moves locomotives and trains manages traffic on our network and coordinates interchanges with other railroads over 900 employees currently work onsite in the facility 

rail facilities – in addition to our track structure we operate numerous facilities including terminals for intermodal and other freight rail yards for trainbuilding classification yards switching storageintransit the temporary storage of customer goods in rail cars prior to shipment and other activities offices to administer and manage our operations dispatch centers to direct traffic on our rail network crew quarters to house train crews along our network and shops and other facilities for fueling maintenance and repair of locomotives and repair and maintenance of rail cars and other equipment the following tables include the major yards and terminals on our system 

 

   

 rail equipment – our equipment includes owned and leased locomotives and rail cars heavy maintenance equipment and machinery other equipment and tools in our shops offices and facilities and vehicles for maintenance transportation of crews and other activities as of december 31 2009 we owned or leased the following units of equipment 

 

 capital expenditures – our rail network requires significant annual capital investments for replacement improvement and expansion these investments enhance safety support the transportation needs of our customers and improve our operational efficiency additionally we add new locomotives and freight cars to our fleet to replace older less efficient equipment to support growth and customer demand and to reduce our impact on the environment through the acquisition of more fuel efficient and lowemission locomotives 

2009 capital expenditures – during 2009 we made capital investments totaling 25 billion which included cash spending of 24 billion see the capital expenditures table in management’s discussion 

  

and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources – financial condition item 7 our capital plan included the acquisition of 127 locomotives at a cost of 287 million we financed 44 of the 127 locomotives with a value of 100 million through a capital lease financing 

infrastructure expansion – with expected longterm growth in the intermodal market we commenced construction of a new intermodal terminal in joliet illinois in august 2009 with completion of the initial phase scheduled in august 2010 this new facility will support customer growth by increasing the railroad’s international and domestic container capacity and improving rail traffic efficiencies in chicago the nation’s largest rail center once on line customers from across our network will benefit from the joliet facility’s annual capacity of 500000 oceangoing containers the integrated facility will include four 8000foot working tracks plus twelve 8000foot support tracks to stage and switch rail cars 3400 parking stalls four cranes an advanced yard system that coordinates all movement of rail cars trucks trailers and containers at the facility and advanced gate technology and security systems 

2010 capital expenditures – in 2010 we expect to make capital investments of approximately 25 billion including expenditures for ptc which may be revised if business conditions or new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments see discussion of our 2010 capital plan in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – 2010 outlook item 7 

equipment encumbrance – equipment with a carrying value of approximately 34 billion and 27 billion at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively serves as collateral for capital leases and other types of equipment obligations in accordance with the secured financing arrangements utilized to acquire such railroad equipment 

as a result of the merger of missouri pacific railroad company mprr with and into uprr on january 1 1997 and pursuant to the underlying indentures for the mprr mortgage bonds uprr must maintain the same value of assets after the merger in order to comply with the security requirements of the mortgage bonds as of the merger date the value of the mprr assets that secured the mortgage bonds was approximately 60 billion in accordance with the terms of the indentures this collateral value must be maintained during the entire term of the mortgage bonds irrespective of the outstanding balance of such bonds 

environmental matters – certain of our properties are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment see discussion of environmental issues in business – governmental and environmental regulation item 1 and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies – environmental item 7 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation that occur in connection with our business we routinely assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest available information and when necessary we seek input from our thirdparty advisors when making these assessments consistent with sec rules and requirements we describe below material pending legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities other proceedings arising under federal state or local environmental laws and regulations including governmental proceedings involving potential fines penalties or other monetary sanctions in excess of 100000 and such other pending matters that we may determine to be appropriate 

  

environmental matters 

as we reported in our annual report on form 10k for 2005 the epa considers the railroad a potentially responsible party for the omaha lead site the omaha lead site consists of approximately 25 square miles of residential property in the eastern part of omaha nebraska allegedly impacted by air emissions from two former lead smeltersrefineries one refinery was operated by asarco the epa identified the railroad as a potentially responsible party because more than 60 years ago the railroad owned land that was leased to asarco the railroad disputes both the legal and technical basis of the epa’s allegations it has nonetheless engaged in extensive negotiations with the epa these negotiations reached an apparent impasse the epa issued a unilateral administrative order with an effective date of december 16 2005 directing the railroad to implement an interim remedy at the site at an estimated cost of 50 million failure to comply with the order without just cause could subject the railroad to penalties of up to 32500 per day and triple the epa’s costs in performing the work the railroad believes it has just cause not to comply with the order but it offered to perform some of the work specified in the order as a compromise on august 5 2009 the railroad received a special notice letter from epa directing us to perform environmental remediation at approximately 9000 residential yards in omaha and to take other remedial measures as part of a final remedy the railroad continues to contest its purported liability for these costs but has submitted an offer to the epa to attempt to negotiate a resolution of the matter to date the epa has rejected all of the railroad’s offers to settle or resolve this matter 

as we reported in our annual report on form 10k for 2005 the illinois attorney general’s office filed a complaint against the railroad in the circuit court for the twentieth judicial circuit st clair county for injunctive and other relief on november 28 2005 alleging a diesel fuel spill from an aboveground storage tank in a rail yard in dupo st clair county illinois the state of illinois seeks to enjoin uprr from further violations and a monetary penalty the amount of the proposed penalty although uncertain could exceed 100000 

as we reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2008 the railroad received notice from the united states department of justice on may 8 2008 indicating its intent to file suit for civil penalties in connection with a march 6 2005 derailment near kamela oregon the derailment resulted in the release of approximately 900 gallons of diesel fuel from ruptured fuel tanks of derailed refrigerator cars some of this fuel entered dry creek a tributary to the grande ronde river while the amount of the ultimate penalty is uncertain it could exceed 100000 additionally on june 9 2009 the oregon department of environmental quality notified the railroad that it would be seeking 40000 in civil penalties from the railroad under state law in connection with this incident 

as we reported in our annual report on form 10k for 2008 the colorado department of public health and environment issued a notice of violationcease and desist order to the railroad on april 26 2007 involving certain alleged violations of the railroad’s stormwater permits at its burnham shops and north yard facilities in denver colorado the order required the railroad among other things to evaluate the effectiveness of the best management practices bmps that were in place to control stormwater and pollutant discharges from the regulated portions of those facilities take appropriate remedial actions implement additional bmps to control the discharge of pollutants at each of the facilities and report the results of its evaluation and demonstrate compliance with its stormwater permits to the agency the railroad and the colorado department of public health and environment reached an agreement during the fourth quarter of 2009 under which we will pay a penalty of 106808 to resolve these matters 

we received notices from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are or may be liable under federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the united states including sites on the superfund national priorities list or state superfund lists we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings and suits because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs 

  

information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies – environmental item 7 

other matters 

as we reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2007 20 small rail shippers many of whom are represented by the same law firms filed virtually identical antitrust lawsuits in various federal district courts against us and four other class i railroads in the us the original plaintiff filed the first of these claims in the us district court in new jersey on may 14 2007 and the additional plaintiffs filed claims in district courts in various states including florida illinois alabama pennsylvania and the district of columbia these suits allege that the named railroads engaged in pricefixing by establishing common fuel surcharges for certain rail traffic 

we received additional complaints following the initial claim increasing the total number of complaints to 30 in addition to suits filed by direct purchasers of rail transportation a few of the suits involve plaintiffs alleging that they are or were indirect purchasers of rail transportation and seek to represent a purported class of indirect purchasers of rail transportation that paid fuel surcharges these complaints have added allegations under state antitrust and consumer protection laws on november 6 2007 the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation ordered that all of the rail fuel surcharge cases be transferred to judge paul friedman of the us district court in the district of columbia for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings subsequently the direct purchaser plaintiffs and the indirect purchaser plaintiffs filed consolidated amended class action complaints against uprr and three other class i railroads 

one additional shipper filed a separate antitrust suit during 2008 subsequently the shipper voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice 

on october 10 2008 judge friedman heard oral arguments with respect to the defendant railroads’ motions to dismiss in a ruling on november 7 2008 judge friedman denied the motion with respect to the direct purchasers’ complaint and therefore that case has moved into discovery on december 31 2008 judge friedman ruled that the allegations of the indirect purchasers based upon state antitrust consumer protection and unjust enrichment laws must be dismissed he also ruled however that the plaintiffs can proceed with their claim for injunctive relief under the federal antitrust laws which is identical to a claim by the direct purchaser plaintiffs the indirect purchasers are appealing judge friedman’s ruling to the us court of appeals for the district of columbia 

we deny the allegations that our fuel surcharge programs violate the antitrust laws or any other laws we believe that these lawsuits are without merit and we will vigorously defend our actions therefore we currently believe that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on any of our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

 results of operations 

operating revenues 

 

 freight revenues are revenues generated by transporting freight or other materials from our six commodity groups freight revenues vary with volume carloads and average revenue per car arc changes in price traffic mix and fuel surcharges drive arc we provide some of our customers with contractual incentives for meeting or exceeding specified cumulative volumes or shipping to and from specific locations which we record as a reduction to freight revenues based on the actual or projected future shipments we recognize freight revenues on a percentageofcompletion basis as freight moves from origin to destination we allocate freight revenues between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them 

other revenues include revenues earned by our subsidiaries revenues from our commuter rail operations and accessorial revenues which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us or when we perform additional services such as switching or storage we recognize other revenues as we perform services or meet contractual obligations 

freight revenues and volume levels for all six commodity groups decreased during 2009 reflecting continued economic weakness we experienced the largest volume declines in automotive and industrial 

  

products shipments lower fuel surcharges due to lower fuel prices also reduced freight revenues in 2009 compared to 2008 arc decreased 7 during the full year driven by lower fuel cost recoveries partially offset by core pricing gain of approximately 5 fuel cost recoveries include fuel surcharge revenue and the impact of resetting the base fuel price for certain traffic which is described below in more detail 

freight revenues from five of the six commodity groups increased during 2008 with particularly strong growth from agricultural and energy shipments while revenues generated from chemical and industrial products shipments grew in 2008 compared to 2007 hurricanes gustav and ike reduced shipments of these commodities revenues generated from automotive shipments declined versus 2007 greater fuel cost recoveries and core pricing improvement combined to increase arc during 2008 the severe economic downturn during the fourth quarter compounded already declining volumes experienced during the first nine months of 2008 due to ongoing weakness in certain market sectors as a result we moved fewer intermodal automotive industrial products and chemical shipments which more than offset volume growth from agricultural and energy shipments 

our fuel surcharge programs excluding indexbased contract escalators that contain some provision for fuel generated freight revenues of 605 million 23 billion and 15 billion in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively declines in both fuel prices and volume levels drove the lower fuel surcharge amounts in 2009 fuel surcharge revenues are not comparable across years due to implementation of new mileagebased fuel surcharge programs as disclosed in our 2006 annual report on form 10k the stb issued a decision limiting the manner in which us railroads can calculate fuel surcharges on traffic regulated by the stb in april 2007 we converted regulated traffic which represents approximately 22 of our current revenue base to mileagebased fuel surcharge programs in addition we continue to convert portions of our nonregulated traffic to mileagebased fuel surcharge programs at the time of introduction we also reset the base fuel price at which the new mileagebased fuel surcharges take effect resetting the fuel price at which the fuel surcharge begins in conjunction with rebasing the affected transportation rate to include a portion of what had been in the fuel surcharge did not materially change our freight revenue as higher base rates offset lower fuel surcharge revenue 

in 2009 other revenues decreased from 2008 due primarily to lower revenues at our subsidiary that brokers intermodal and automotive services accessorial revenues also decreased in 2009 reflecting lower volume levels during the year 

the following tables summarize the yearoveryear changes in freight revenues revenue carloads and arc by commodity type 

 

   

  

   

   

   

 mexico business – each of our commodity groups include revenue from shipments to and from mexico revenue from mexico business decreased 26 in 2009 versus 2008 to 12 billion volume declined in five of our six commodity groups down 19 in 2009 driven by 32 and 24 reductions in industrial products and automotive shipments respectively conversely energy shipments increased 9 in 2009 versus 2008 partially offsetting these declines 

revenue from mexico business increased 13 to 16 billion in 2008 compared to 2007 price improvements and fuel surcharges contributed to these increases partially offset by a 4 decline in volume in 2008 compared to 2007 

operating expenses 

 

   

 compensation and benefits – compensation and benefits include wages payroll taxes health and welfare costs pension costs other postretirement benefits and incentive costs lower volume and productivity initiatives led to a 10 decline in our workforce in 2009 compared to 2008 saving 516 million during the year conversely general wage and benefit inflation increased expenses partially offsetting these savings 

productivity initiatives in all areas combined with lower volume led to a 4 decline in our workforce for 2008 saving 227 million compared to 2007 conversely general wage and benefit inflation and higher pension and postretirement benefits increased expenses in 2008 partially offsetting these reductions 

fuel – fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and nonhighway vehicles and heavy equipment lower diesel fuel prices which averaged 175 per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in 2009 compared to 315 per gallon in 2008 reduced expenses by 13 billion volume as measured by gross tonmiles decreased 17 in the year lowering expenses by 664 million compared to 2008 our fuel consumption rate improved 4 in 2009 resulting in 147 million of cost savings versus 2008 newer more fuel efficient locomotives reflecting locomotive acquisitions in recent years and the impact of a smaller fleet due to storage of some of our older locomotives increased use of distributed locomotive power our fuel conservation programs and improved network operations all drove this improvement distributed locomotive power is the practice of distributing locomotives throughout a train rather than positioning all of them in the lead resulting in safer and more efficient train operations 

diesel fuel prices which averaged 315 per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in 2008 compared to 227 per gallon in 2007 increased expenses by 11 billion a 4 improvement in our fuel consumption rate resulted in 136 million of cost savings due to the use of newer more fuel efficient locomotives our fuel conservation programs improved network operations and a shift in commodity mix primarily due to growth in bulk shipments volume as measured by gross tonmiles decreased 3 in the year lowering expenses by 101 million compared to 2007 

purchased services and materials – purchased services and materials expense includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors materials used to maintain the railroad’s lines structures and equipment costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other railroads transportation and 

  

lodging for train crew employees trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers leased automobile maintenance expenses and tools and supplies contract services expense including equipment maintenance decreased 138 million in 2009 versus 2008 due to lower volume levels and a favorable yearoveryear comparison due to expenses incurred in 2008 resulting from hurricanes gustav and ike in addition lower volume levels drove cost reductions of 55 million in transportation and lodging costs and 27 million in expenses associated with operating jointly owned facilities in 2009 versus 2008 we also performed fewer locomotive and freight car repairs as a result of lower volumes and having portions of these fleets stored which reduced related materials expenses by 87 million in 2009 versus 2008 cleanup and restoration expenses related to the cascade mudslide in january flooding in the midwest in june and the two september hurricanes also increased expenses in 2008 creating a favorable yearoveryear comparison 

in 2008 higher contract costs including restoration costs related to the january cascade mudslide june midwest flooding and september hurricanes increased expenses 40 million compared to 2007 higher material costs for freight car wheel sets during the year and an increase in the number of wheel sets required to repair flooddamaged freight cars also contributed to higher materials expense in 2008 conversely rail scrap proceeds associated with our rail replacement program partially offset these increases for the year 

depreciation – the majority of depreciation relates to track structure including rail ties and other track material a higher depreciable asset base reflecting higher capital spending in recent years increased depreciation expense in 2009 versus 2008 costs also increased 34 million in 2009 due to the restructuring of certain locomotive leases see further discussion in this item 7 under liquidity and capital resources – financing activities lower depreciation rates for rail and other track material partially offset the increases the lower rates which became effective january 1 2009 resulted from longer asset lives as determined by service life studies and reduced track usage based on lower gross tonmiles 

a higher depreciable asset base reflecting higher capital spending in recent years increased depreciation expense in 2008 versus 2007 

equipment and other rents – equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies freight car intermodal and locomotive leases other specialty equipment leases and office and other rentals fewer shipments of industrial products and intermodal containers primarily contributed to the 85 million reduction in our shortterm freight car rental expense in 2009 versus 2008 in addition the restructuring of locomotive leases reduced lease expense by 52 million in 2009 compared to 2008 see further discussion in this item 7 under liquidity and capital resources – financing activities lower lease expense for freight cars intermodal containers and fleet vehicles also decreased costs in 2009 versus 2008 

fewer shipments of finished vehicles industrial products and intermodal containers reduced our short term freight car rental expense by 62 million in 2008 compared to 2007 lower lease expense for freight cars intermodal containers and locomotives also decreased costs conversely lease expense for fleet vehicles increased costs in 2008 compared to 2007 

other – other expenses include personal injury freight and property damage insurance environmental bad debt state and local taxes utilities telephone and cellular employee travel computer software and other general expenses other costs were lower in 2009 compared to 2008 driven by a reduction in personal injury expense including asbestosrelated claims we completed actuarial studies of personal injury expenses in both the second and fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008 and annual reviews of asbestosrelated claims in both years which resulted in a net reduction of 55 million in casualty expense in 2009 versus 2008 the reduction reflects improvements in our safety experience and lower estimated costs to resolve claims in addition the yearoveryear comparison was favorably impacted by 28 million due to 

  

an adverse development with respect to one claim in 2008 and favorable developments in three cases in 2009 other costs were also lower in 2009 compared to 2008 driven by a decrease in expenses for freight and property damages employee travel and utilities in addition higher bad debt expense in 2008 due to the uncertain impact of the recessionary economy drove a favorable yearoveryear comparison conversely an additional expense of 30 million related to a transaction with pacer international inc and higher property taxes partially offset lower costs in 2009 

other costs were higher in 2008 compared to 2007 due to an increase in bad debts state and local taxes loss and damage expenses utility costs and other miscellaneous expenses totaling 122 million conversely personal injury costs including asbestosrelated claims were 8 million lower in 2008 compared to 2007 the reduction reflects improvements in our safety experience and lower estimated costs to resolve claims as indicated in the actuarial studies of our personal injury expense and annual reviews of asbestosrelated claims in both 2008 and 2007 the yearoveryear comparison also includes the negative impact of adverse development associated with one claim in 2008 in addition environmental and toxic tort expenses were 7 million lower in 2008 compared to 2007 

nonoperating items 

 

 other income – other income increased 103 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to higher gains from real estate sales which included the 116 million pretax gain from a land sale to the regional transportation district rtd in colorado and lower interest expense on our sale of receivables program resulting from lower interest rates and a lower outstanding balance reduced rental and licensing income and lower returns on cash investments reflecting lower interest rates partially offset these increases 

other income decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to lower gains from real estate sales and decreased returns on cash investments reflecting lower interest rates higher rental and licensing income and lower interest expense on our sale of receivables program partially offset the decreases 

interest expense – interest expense increased in 2009 versus 2008 due primarily to higher weightedaverage debt levels in 2009 the weightedaverage debt level was 96 billion including the restructuring of locomotive leases in may of 2009 compared to 83 billion in 2008 our effective interest rate was 63 in 2009 compared to 61 in 2008 

interest expense increased in 2008 versus 2007 due to a higher weightedaverage debt level of 83 billion compared to 73 billion in 2007 a lower effective interest rate of 61 in 2008 compared to 66 in 2007 partially offset the effects of the higher weightedaverage debt level 

income taxes – income taxes were lower in 2009 compared to 2008 driven by lower pretax income our effective tax rate for the year was 365 compared to 361 in 2008 

income taxes were higher in 2008 compared to 2007 driven by higher pretax income our effective tax rates were 361 and 384 in 2008 and 2007 respectively the lower effective tax rate in 2008 resulted from several reductions in tax expense related to federal audits and state tax law changes in addition the effective tax rate in 2007 was increased by illinois legislation that increased deferred tax expense in the third quarter of 2007 

  

other operatingperformance and financial statistics 

we report key railroad performance measures weekly to the association of american railroads aar including carloads average daily inventory of rail cars on our system average train speed and average terminal dwell time we provide this data on our website at wwwupcominvestorsreportsindexshtml 

operatingperformance statistics 

included in the table below are railroad performance measures reported to the aar 

 

 average train speed – average train speed is calculated by dividing train miles by hours operated on our main lines between terminals lower volume levels ongoing network management initiatives and productivity improvements contributed to 16 and 8 improvements in average train speed in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

average terminal dwell time – average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our terminals lower average terminal dwell time improves asset utilization and service average terminal dwell time improved slightly in 2009 compared to 2008 and improved 1 in 2008 versus 2007 lower volumes combined with initiatives to more timely deliver rail cars to our interchange partners and customers improved dwell time in both periods 

gross and revenue tonmiles – gross tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled revenue tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles gross and revenuetonmiles decreased 17 and 15 in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a 16 decrease in carloads commodity mix changes notably automotive shipments which were 30 lower in 2009 compared to 2008 drove the difference in declines between gross tonmiles and revenue tonmiles gross tonmiles decreased 3 while revenue tonmiles were flat in 2008 compared to 2007 with commodity mix changes notably autos and coal explaining the variance in year over year growth between the two metrics 

operating ratio – operating ratio is defined as our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue our operating ratios improved 13 points to 760 in 2009 and 20 points to 773 in 2008 core pricing gains lower fuel prices network management initiatives and improved productivity drove the improvement in 2009 and more than offset the 16 volume decline price increases fuel cost recoveries network management initiatives and improved productivity drove the improvement in 2008 and more than offset the impact of higher fuel prices 

employees – productivity initiatives and lower volumes reduced employee levels 10 throughout the company in 2009 versus 2008 and 4 in 2008 compared to 2007 fewer train and engine personnel due 

  

to lower volumes and network initiatives combined with improved productivity within the support organizations contributed to the lower fulltime equivalent force levels 

customer satisfaction index – our customer satisfaction survey asks customers to rate how satisfied they are with our performance over the last 12 months on a variety of attributes a higher score indicates higher customer satisfaction the improvement in survey results in 2009 and 2008 generally reflects customer recognition of our improving service

 roic is considered a nongaap financial measure by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe this measure is important in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the corporation’s longterm capital investments and we currently use roic as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of equity compensation for our executives roic should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for other information provided in accordance with gaap the most comparable gaap measure is return on average common shareholders’ equity the tables above provide a reconciliation from return on average common shareholders’ equity to roic our 2009 roic decreased 20 points compared to 2008 primarily as a result of lower earnings and higher average debt and equity levels 

  

debt to capital  adjusted debt to capital 

 

  

 adjusted debt to capital is a nongaap financial measure under sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk we believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the total amount of leverage in our capital structure including offbalance sheet lease obligations which we generally incur in connection with financing the acquisition of locomotives and freight cars and certain facilities operating leases were discounted using 63 at december 31 2009 and 80 at december 31 2008 the lower discount rate reflects changes to interest rates and our current financing costs we monitor the ratio of adjusted debt to capital as we manage our capital structure to balance costeffective and efficient access to the capital markets with the corporation’s overall cost of capital adjusted debt to capital should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for debt to capital the tables above provide a reconciliation from debt to capital to adjusted debt to capital our december 31 2009 debt to capital ratios increased as a result of a 921 million net increase in debt from december 31 2008 equity at december 31 2008 was reduced by 704 million for other comprehensive losses other comprehensive losses in 2008 were related primarily to pensions see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for more information 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2009 our principal sources of liquidity included cash cash equivalents the sale of certain receivables and our revolving credit facility as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets we had 19 billion of committed credit available under our credit facility with no borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2009 we did not make any borrowings under this facility during 2009 the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the sale of receivables program was 400 million as of december 31 2009 the sale of receivables program is subject to certain requirements including maintenance of an investment grade bond rating if our bond rating were to deteriorate it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financings is dependent on market conditions deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to utilize commercial paper as a source of liquidity access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability we expect that we will continue to 

  

have access to liquidity by issuing bonds to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets 

at december 31 2009 we had a working capital surplus of approximately 10 billion which reflects our decision to maintain additional cash reserves to enhance liquidity in response to difficult economic conditions at december 31 2008 we had a working capital deficit of approximately 100 million historically we have had a working capital deficit which is common in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity we maintain adequate resources and when necessary have access to capital to meet any daily and shortterm cash requirements and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

 

 operating activities 

lower net income in 2009 a reduction of 184 million in the outstanding balance of our accounts receivable securitization program higher pension contributions of 72 million and changes to working capital combined to decrease cash provided by operating activities compared to 2008 higher net income and changes in working capital combined to increase cash provided by operating activities in 2008 compared to 2007 in addition accelerated tax deductions enacted in 2008 on certain new operating assets resulted in lower income tax payments in 2008 versus 2007 voluntary pension contributions in 2008 totaling 200 million and other pension contributions of 8 million partially offset the yearoveryear increase versus 2007 

investing activities 

lower capital investments and higher proceeds from asset sales drove the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2009 versus 2008 increased capital investments and lower proceeds from asset sales drove the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2008 compared to 2007 

  

the tables below detail cash capital investments and track statistics for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

 capital plan – in 2010 we expect our total capital investments to be approximately 25 billion which may be revised if business conditions or new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments we expect approximately 73 of our 2010 capital investments will replace and improve existing capital assets major investment categories include replacing and improving track infrastructure increasing network and terminal capacity improving locomotives and freight cars improving technology including investing in ptc and other capital projects we expect to fund our 2010 cash capital investments through cash generated from operations the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties issuance of longterm debt and cash on hand at december 31 2009 our annual capital plan is a critical component of our longterm strategic plan which we expect will enhance the longterm value of the corporation for our shareholders by providing sufficient resources to i replace and improve our existing track infrastructure to provide safe and fluid operations ii increase network efficiency by adding or improving facilities and track and iii make investments that meet customer demand and take advantage of opportunities for longterm growth 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities decreased in 2009 versus 2008 during 2009 we did not repurchase any shares under our common stock repurchase program compared to 16 billion of repurchases in 2008 additionally debt repayments were 337 million lower in 2009 partially offset by lower new debt issuances of 14 billion and higher dividend payments we increased our dividend from 022 per share to its current level of 027 per share effective in the third quarter of 2008 the restructuring of equipment leases also generated 87 million in cash consideration further contributing to the decrease see further discussion in this item 7 under liquidity and capital resources – financing activities cash 

  

used in financing activities increased in 2008 versus 2007 due to higher debt repayments of 416 million an increase of 234 million for the repurchase of common shares see further discussion of common shares in market for the registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  purchases of equity securities part ii item 5 and an increase of dividends paid reflecting a higher quarterly dividend higher debt issuances of 676 million partially offset these increases 

credit facilities – on december 31 2009 we had 19 billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility the facility the facility is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper we did not draw on the facility during 2009 commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investmentgrade borrowers the facility allows borrowings at floating rates based on london interbank offered rates plus a spread depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings the facility requires union pacific corporation to maintain a debttonetworth coverage ratio as a condition to making a borrowing at december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 and at all times during these periods we were in compliance with this covenant 

the definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the debttonetworth coverage ratio includes among other things certain credit arrangements capital leases guarantees and unfunded and vested pension benefits under title iv of erisa at december 31 2009 the debttonetworth coverage ratio allowed us to carry up to 339 billion of debt as defined in the facility and we had 104 billion of debt as defined in the facility outstanding at that date under our current capital plans we expect to continue to satisfy the debttonetworth coverage ratio however many factors beyond our reasonable control including the risk factors in item 1a of this report could affect our ability to comply with this provision in the future the facility does not include any other financial restrictions credit rating triggers other than ratingdependent pricing or any other provision that could require us to post collateral the facility also includes a 75 million crossdefault provision and a changeofcontrol provision the facility will expire in april 2012 in accordance with its terms and we currently intend to replace the facility with a substantially similar credit agreement on or before the expiration date which is consistent with our past practices with respect to our credit facilities 

at december 31 2009 we had no commercial paper outstanding our commercial paper balance is supported by our revolving credit facility but does not reduce the amount of borrowings available under the facility during 2009 we issued 100 million of commercial paper and repaid 200 million 

at december 31 2009 we reclassified as longterm debt approximately 320 million of debt due within one year that we intend to refinance this reclassification reflected our ability and intent to refinance any shortterm borrowings and certain current maturities of longterm debt on a longterm basis at december 31 2008 we reclassified as longterm debt approximately 400 million of debt due within one year that we intended to refinance at that time 

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

for each of the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 49 59 and 51 respectively the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis earnings represent income from continuing operations less equity earnings net of distributions plus fixed charges and income taxes fixed charges represent interest charges amortization of debt discount and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges see exhibit 12 to this report for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

  

common shareholders’ equity 

dividend restrictions – our revolving credit facility includes a debttonet worth covenant that under certain circumstances restricts the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders the amount of retained earnings available for dividends was 117 billion and 105 billion at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

stock split – on may 28 2008 we completed a twoforone stock split effected in the form of a 100 stock dividend the stock split entitled all shareholders of record at the close of business on may 12 2008 to receive one additional share of our common stock par value 250 per share for each share of common stock held on that date 

share repurchase program – on january 30 2007 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 40 million shares of union pacific corporation common stock through the end of 2009 on may 1 2008 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 40 million common shares by march 31 2011 management’s assessments of market conditions and other pertinent facts guide the timing and volume of all repurchases during 2009 we did not repurchase shares under this program in 2008 we repurchased approximately 22 million shares at an aggregate purchase price of approximately 15 billion these shares were recorded in treasury stock at cost which includes any applicable commissions and fees if we elect to make repurchases of our common stock under this program in 2010 we expect to fund such repurchases through cash generated from operations the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties debt issuances and cash on hand 

shelf registration statement and significant new borrowings – under our current shelf registration statement we may issue from time to time any combination of debt securities preferred stock common stock or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings in july 2008 our board of directors authorized the issuance of an additional 3 billion of debt securities under our shelf registration at december 31 2009 we had remaining authority to issue up to 225 billion of debt securities 

during 2009 we issued the following unsecured fixedrate debt securities under our current shelf registration 

 

 the net proceeds from these offerings were for general corporate purposes including the repurchase of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program these debt securities include changeofcontrol provisions 

we have no immediate plans to issue equity securities however we will continue to explore opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under our shelf registration and therefore we may issue additional debt securities at any time 

during the second quarter of 2009 we restructured lease agreements for 813 locomotives resulting in a change in lease classification from operating to capital as part of the restructuring arrangements we received 87 million in cash consideration we recorded capital lease assets of approximately 742 million and related capital lease obligations totaling approximately 843 million included in our capital lease obligations is the 87 million in cash consideration and 14 million of accrued operating lease 

  

payables that were reclassified as part of our capital lease obligations capital lease obligations are reported in our consolidated statements of financial position as debt 

on october 15 2009 we entered into a capital lease agreement for 44 locomotives with a total equipment cost of 100 million the lessor purchased the 44 locomotives from the corporation and subsequently leased the locomotives back to the railroad these capital lease obligations are reported in our consolidated statements of financial position as debt at december 31 2009 

offbalance sheet arrangements contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and as referenced in the tables below we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments including material sources of offbalance sheet and structured finance arrangements other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets as described in item 1a of part ii of this report there is no known trend demand commitment event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition our commercial obligations financings and commitments are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations particularly within the transportation industry 

the following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of december 31 2009 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

sale of receivables – the railroad transfers most of its accounts receivable to union pacific receivables inc upri a bankruptcyremote subsidiary as part of a sale of receivables facility upri sells without recourse on a 364day revolving basis an undivided interest in such accounts receivable to investors the total capacity to sell undivided interests to investors under the facility was 600 million and 700 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the facility was 400 million and 584 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively during 2009 upri reduced the outstanding undivided interest held by investors due to a decrease in available receivables the value of the undivided interest held by investors is not included in our consolidated financial statements the value of the undivided interest held by investors was supported by 817 million and 1015 million of accounts receivable held by upri at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively at december 31 2009 and 2008 the value of the interest retained by upri was 417 million and 431 million respectively this retained interest is included in accounts receivable in our consolidated financial statements the interest sold to investors is sold at carrying value which approximates fair value and there is no gain or loss recognized from the transaction 

the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors could fluctuate based upon the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks including default and dilution if default or dilution ratios increase one percent the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would not change as of december 31 2009 should our credit rating fall below investment grade the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would be reduced and in certain cases the investors would have the right to discontinue the facility 

the railroad services the sold receivables however the railroad does not recognize any servicing asset or liability as the servicing fees adequately compensate us for these responsibilities the railroad collected approximately 138 billion and 178 billion during the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively upri used certain of these proceeds to purchase new receivables under the facility 

the costs of the sale of receivables program are included in other income and were 9 million 23 million and 35 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the costs include interest which will vary based on prevailing commercial paper rates program fees paid to banks commercial paper issuing costs and fees for unused commitment availability the decrease in the 2009 costs was primarily attributable to lower commercial paper rates and a decrease in the outstanding interest held by investors 

  

the investors have no recourse to the railroad’s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims creditors of the railroad do not have recourse to the assets of upri 

in august 2009 the sale of receivables facility was renewed for an additional 364day period at comparable terms and conditions although the capacity to sell undivided interests was reduced from 700 million to 600 million 

see further discussion in this item 7 under other matters – accounting pronouncements for information about recent accounting pronouncements that will have an impact on the accounting treatment of our sale of receivables program 

guarantees – at december 31 2009 we were contingently liable for 416 million in guarantees we have recorded a liability of 3 million and 4 million for the fair value of these obligations as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business and they include guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building equipment financings and affiliated operations the final guarantee expires in 2022 we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

other matters 

inflation – the cumulative effect of long periods of inflation significantly increases asset replacement costs for capitalintensive companies as a result assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels depreciation charges on an inflationadjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 

derivative financial instruments – we may use derivative financial instruments in limited instances to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and fuel prices we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged both at inception and throughout the hedged period we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items at inception as well as our riskmanagement objectives strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness changes in the fair market value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are charged to earnings we may use swaps collars futures andor forward contracts to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in interest rates and fuel prices however the use of these derivative financial instruments may limit future benefits from favorable price movements 

market and credit risk – we address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item we manage credit risk related to derivative financial instruments which is minimal by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements at december 31 2009 and 2008 we were not required to provide collateral nor had we received collateral relating to our hedging activities 

determination of fair value – we determine the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or the present value of expected future cash flows 

sensitivity analyses – the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 

  

at december 31 2009 we had variablerate debt representing approximately 4 of our total debt if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2010 than our december 31 2009 variable rate which was approximately 2 our interest expense would increase by approximately 4 million this amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balances of our variablerate debt at december 31 2009 

market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2009 and amounts to an increase of approximately 774 million to the fair value of our debt at december 31 2009 we estimated the fair values of our fixedrate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 

interest rate fair value hedges – we manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period we generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings we employ derivatives primarily swaps as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix in addition we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixedrate debt securities 

swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt’s fair value attributable to the changes in interest rates we account for swaps as fair value hedges using the shortcut method as allowed by the derivatives and hedging topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc therefore we do not record any ineffectiveness within our consolidated financial statements 

interest rate cash flow hedges – we report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss until the hedged item affects earnings at december 31 2009 and 2008 we had reductions of 3 million and 4 million respectively recorded as an accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss that is being amortized on a straightline basis through september 30 2014 as of december 31 2009 and 2008 we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding 

accounting pronouncements – in january 2010 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201006 improving disclosures about fair value measurements the update provides amendments to fasb asc 82010 that require entities to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers in addition the update requires entities to present separately information about purchases sales issuances and settlements in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level 3 the disclosures related to level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements are effective for us in 2010 and the disclosures related to level 3 fair value measurements are effective for us in 2011 the update requires new disclosures only and will have no impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in june 2009 the fasb issued statement no 166 accounting for transfers of financial assets—an amendment of fasb statement no 140 fas 166 fas 166 limits the circumstances in which transferred financial assets can be derecognized and requires enhanced disclosures regarding transfers of financial assets and a transferor’s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets in addition the concept of a qualifying specialpurpose entity is no longer relevant for accounting purposes therefore formerly qualifying specialpurpose entities as defined under previous accounting standards should be evaluated for consolidation by reporting entities on and after the effective date in accordance with the applicable consolidation guidance fas 166 will be effective for us beginning in 2010 after adoption transfers of undivided interests in accounts receivable to investors under our sale of receivables program will no longer qualify for sale treatment but rather will be accounted for as secured borrowings 

  

in our consolidated statements of financial position we are still evaluating the impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows related to the adoption of this standard the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under our sale of receivables program at december 31 2009 was 400 million 

in june 2009 the fasb issued statement no 167 amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r fas 167 fas 167 retains the scope of interpretation 46r consolidation of variable interest entities  with the addition of entities previously considered qualifying specialpurpose entities as the concept of these entities was eliminated in fasb statement no 166 accounting for transfers of financial assets—an amendment of fasb statement no 140 fas 167 will be effective for us beginning in 2010 the adoption of fas 167 will not affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in june 2009 the fasb issued statement no 168 the fasb accounting standards codification tm and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles—a replacement of fasb statement no 162 fas 168 the codification became the source of authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants on the effective date of fas 168 the codification superseded all thenexisting nonsec accounting and reporting standards all other nongrandfathered nonsec accounting literature not included in the codification became nonauthoritative fas 168 was effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september 15 2009 the adoption of fas 168 did not affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in may 2009 the fasb issued statement no 165 subsequent events fas 165 codified as fasb asc 8551050 fas 165 establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued it requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date fas 165 was effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after june 15 2009 the adoption of fas 165 did not affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in april 2009 the fasb issued fsp no fas 1071 and apb 281 interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments codified as fasb asc 8201050 this fsp amends fasb statement no 107 to require disclosures about fair values of financial instruments for interim reporting periods as well as in annual financial statements the fsp also amends apb opinion no 28 to require those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods this fsp was effective for interim reporting periods ending after june 15 2009 the adoption of this fsp did not affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in december 2008 the fasb issued fsp fas 132r1 employers’ disclosure about postretirement benefit plan assets codified as fasb asc 7152050 which amended statement 132r to require more detailed disclosures about employers’ pension plan assets new disclosures include more information on investment strategies major categories of plan assets concentrations of risk within plan assets and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets this new standard required new disclosures only and had no impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows these new disclosures are included in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

change in accounting principle – we have historically accounted for rail grinding costs as a capital asset beginning in the first quarter of 2010 we will change our accounting policy for rail grinding costs from a capitalization method under which we have capitalized the cost of rail grinding and depreciated such capitalized costs to a direct expense method under which we will expense rail grinding costs as incurred the expense as incurred method is preferable as it eliminates the subjectivity in determining 

  

the period of benefit associated with rail grinding over which to depreciate the associated capitalized costs we will reflect this change as a change in accounting principle from an acceptable accounting principle to a preferable accounting principle the application of this preferable accounting principle will be presented retrospectively to all periods presented in future earnings releases and sec filings when the accounting principle is retrospectively applied net income for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 will decrease by approximately 8 million 3 million and 7 million or 001 001 and 002 per share respectively this change in accounting principle is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

asserted and unasserted claims – various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries we cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity however to the extent possible where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated we have recorded a liability we do not expect that any known lawsuits claims environmental costs commitments contingent liabilities or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters 

indemnities – our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements including certain tax indemnifications can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions 

climate change – although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item 1a of this report we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact however we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment including investments in new technologies using training programs to reduce fuel consumption and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 2 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 these critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 

personal injury – the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year we use thirdparty actuaries to assist us in measuring the expense and liability including unasserted claims the federal employers’ liability act fela governs compensation for workrelated accidents under fela damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or outofcourt settlements we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 

  

our personal injury liability is discounted to present value using applicable us treasury rates approximately 13 of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 87 related to unasserted claims at december 31 2009 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 545 million to 602 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss is more probable than any other our personal injury liability activity was as follows 

 

 asbestos – we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other parties allege exposure to asbestos we engage a third party with extensive experience in estimating resolution costs for asbestosrelated claims to assist us in assessing our potential liability this liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing costs the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions 

 

      

our liability for asbestosrelated claims is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments approximately 21 of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 79 related to unasserted claims at december 31 2009 because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestosrelated claims it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately 174 million to 189 million we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss is more probable than any other in conjunction with the liability update performed in 2009 we also reassessed estimated insurance recoveries we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2009 and 2008 our asbestosrelated liability activity was as follows 

 

 we believe that our estimates of liability for asbestosrelated claims and insurance recoveries are reasonable and probable the amounts recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts however future events such as the number of new claims to be filed each year average settlement costs and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts estimates also may vary in the future if strategies activities and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change federal and state laws governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimants and there are material changes with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants 

environmental – we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations we identified 307 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements this includes 32 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government 17 of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 

  

when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in our business we and our consultants perform environmental assessments on the property we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and we can reasonably estimate such costs we do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable at december 31 2009 approximately 12 of our environmental liability was discounted at 34 while approximately 13 of our environmental liability was discounted at 35 at december 31 2008 our environmental liability activity was as follows 

 

 the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties cost estimates are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and existing technology laws and regulations the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties sitespecific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal state and local laws governing environmental remediation current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

property and depreciation – our railroad operations are highly capital intensive and our large base of homogeneous networktype assets turns over on a continuous basis each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated service lives which are measured in years except for rail in highdensity traffic corridors ie all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment yard and switching tracks and electronic yards which are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics use and expected life are grouped together in asset classes and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources not as singular items we currently have more than 60 depreciable asset classes 

  

and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology asset strategies or other factors 

we determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property by means of depreciation studies we perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets ie rail and other track material ties and ballast and other road property our depreciation studies take into account the following factors 

 

    for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track it has been our experience that the lives of rail in highdensity traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage ie the amount of weight carried over the rail the service lives also vary based on rail weight rail condition eg new or secondhand and rail type eg straight or curve our depreciation studies for rail in high density traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives for rail in highdensity traffic corridors we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross tonmiles carried over the rail ie the weight of loaded and empty freight cars locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile rail in highdensity traffic corridors accounts for approximately 70 percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material based on the number of gross tonmiles carried over our rail in high density traffic corridors during 2009 the estimated service lives of the majority of this rail ranged from 14 years to 30 years for all other depreciable assets we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively 

estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to changes in physical use technology asset strategies and other factors that will have an impact on the retirement profiles of our assets we are not aware of any specific factors that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service lives of our assets actual use and retirement of our assets may vary from our current estimates which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future periods 

changes in estimated useful lives of our assets due to the results of our depreciation studies could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately 43 million if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were decreased by one year annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately 46 million our recent depreciation studies have resulted in changes in depreciation rates for some asset classes which did not significantly affect our annual depreciation expense 

under group depreciation the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using i inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ii the estimated useful life of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired we continually monitor the estimated service 

  

lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate 

for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions i is unusual ii is material in amount and iii varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies during the last three fiscal years no gains or losses were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad properties a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations 

income taxes – we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns these expected future tax consequences are measured based on current tax law the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated future tax law changes such as a change in the corporate tax rate could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity for example a 1 increase in future income tax rates would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately 280 million 

when appropriate we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reflect that these tax assets may not be realized in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized based on management’s judgments using available evidence about future events the valuation allowance at december 31 2009 was 8 million there was no valuation allowance at december 31 2008 

at times we may claim tax benefits that may be challenged by a tax authority we recognize tax benefits only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement a liability for “unrecognized tax benefits” is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards 

pension and other postretirement benefits – we use thirdparty actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and defined contribution medical and life insurance benefits opeb to eligible employees in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make several assumptions the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets for opeb the critical assumptions are the discount rate and healthcare cost trend rate 

we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually and selected assumptions are based on the following factors 

 

     

the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure pension and opeb expense for 2009 and the estimated impact on 2009 pension and opeb expense relative to a change in those assumptions

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission

automotive – we are the largest automotive carrier west of the mississippi river serving seven vehicle assembly plants and distributing imported vehicles from six west coast ports and houston we offload finished vehicles at 38 vehicle distribution centers for delivery by truck to all major western us cities in addition to transporting finished vehicles we provide expedited handling of automotive parts in both boxcars and intermodal containers to several assembly plants we carry automotive materials bound for assembly plants in mexico the us and canada and we also transport finished vehicles from manufacturing facilities in mexico in 2008 transportation of finished vehicles and automotive materials accounted for 8 of our freight revenues 

  

chemicals – transporting chemicals provided 15 of our freight revenues in 2008 our franchise enables us to serve the chemical producing areas along the gulf coast as well as the rocky mountain region twothirds of the chemicals business consists of liquid and dry chemicals plastics and liquid petroleum products in addition to transporting plastics customers also use our storageintransit yards for intermediate storage of plastic resins soda ash shipments originate in southwestern wyoming and california destined primarily for glass producing markets in the east the west and abroad fertilizer movements originate primarily in the gulf coast region as well as the west and canada bound for major agricultural users in the midwest and the western us 

energy – coal transportation accounted for 22 of our 2008 freight revenues our transportation network allows us to transport coal and coke to utilities industrial facilities interchange points and water terminals the water terminals provide access to the west and gulf coasts for export and railbarge interchange facilities on the mississippi and ohio rivers and the great lakes we serve mines located in the southern powder river basin of wyoming sprb colorado utah southern wyoming and southern illinois sprb coal represents the largest growth segment of the market as utilities continue to favor its lower cost and lowsulfur content 

industrial products – our extensive network enables our industrial products group to move numerous commodities between thousands of origin and destination points throughout north america lumber shipments originate primarily in the pnw and canada for destinations throughout the united states for new home construction and repair and remodeling commercial and highway construction drives shipments of steel and construction products consisting of rock cement and roofing materials paper and consumer goods including furniture and appliances are shipped to major metropolitan areas for consumers nonferrous metals and industrial minerals are moved for industrial manufacturing in addition we provide efficient and safe transportation for government entities and waste companies in 2008 transporting industrial products provided 19 of our freight revenues

seasonality – some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons reflecting either or both the nature of the commodity such as certain agricultural and food products that have specific growing and harvesting seasons and the demand cycle for the commodity such as intermodal traffic which generally has a peak shipping season during the third quarter to meet holidayrelated demand for consumer goods during the fourth quarter the peak shipping seasons for these commodities can vary considerably from year to year depending upon various factors including the strength of domestic and international economies and currencies and the strength of harvests and market prices of agricultural products in response to an annual request delivered by the surface transportation board stb of the united states department of transportation dot to all of the class i railroads operating in the us we issue a letter during the third quarter detailing our plans for handling traffic during the third and fourth quarters and providing other information requested by the stb 

working capital – we currently have and historically have had a working capital deficit which is common in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity or financial stability we maintain adequate resources and when necessary have access to capital to meet any daily and shortterm cash requirements and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

  

competition – we are subject to competition from other railroads motor carriers ship and barge operators and pipelines our main rail competitor is burlington northern santa fe corporation its rail subsidiary bnsf railway company bnsf operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors in addition we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers motor carrier competition is particularly strong for five of our six commodity groups excluding energy because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and gulf coast waterways barges can be particularly competitive especially for grain and bulk commodities in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service while we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation or legislation releasing motor carriers from their size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

equipment suppliers – we depend on two key domestic suppliers of locomotives due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of this equipment potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry with respect to this industry therefore if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives for any reason including insolvency or bankruptcy we could experience a significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations additionally there are two key suppliers of rail for us railroads one domestic and one international rail is critical for both maintenance of our network and replacement and improvement or expansion of our network and facilities rail manufacturing also has high barriers to entry and if one of those suppliers discontinues operations for any reason including insolvency or bankruptcy we could experience cost increases and difficulty obtaining rail 

employees – approximately 86 of our 48242 fulltimeequivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions we concluded the most recent round of negotiations with the unions in 2008 when the last three unions yardmasters united transportation union and the iam ratified new agreements the 14 unions executed similar multiyear agreements that provide for wage increases and increased employee health and welfare cost sharing the annual wage increases including retroactive increases are as follows july 2005 25 july 2006 30 july 2007 30 july 2008 40 july 2009 45 the current agreements expire on december 31 2009 and the next round of negotiations will begin in late 2009 

railroad security – operating a safe and secure railroad is first among our critical priorities and is a primary responsibility of all our employees this emphasis helps us protect the public and our employees our customers and our operations and rail network our security efforts rely upon a wide variety of measures including employee training cooperation with our customers training of emergency responders and partnerships with numerous federal state and local government agencies while federal law requires us to protect the confidentiality of our security plans designed to safeguard against terrorism and other security incidents the following provides a general overview of our security initiatives 

uprr security measures – we maintain a comprehensive security plan designed to deter and to respond to any potential or actual threats as they arise the plan includes four levels of alert status each with its own set of countermeasures we employ our own police force consisting of more than 220 commissioned and highlytrained officers our employees also undergo recurrent security and preparedness training as well as federallymandated hazardous materials and security training we regularly review the sufficiency of our employee training programs for ways to increase preparedness and to improve security 

we have an emergency response management center which operates 24 hours a day the center receives reports of emergencies dangerous or potentially dangerous conditions and other safety and security issues from our employees the public and law enforcement and other government officials in cooperation with government officials we monitor both threats and public events and as necessary we 

  

may alter rail traffic flow near highrisk areas to minimize risk to communities we serve and our operations we comply with the hazardous materials routing rules and other requirements imposed by federal law we also design our operating plan to expedite the movement of hazardous material shipments to minimize the time rail cars remain idle at yards and terminals located in or near major population centers additionally we are prepared to comply with new transportation security agency tsa regulations governing tracking and the chain of custody for rail securitysensitive material shipments including toxic inhalation hazard materials which will take effect on april 1 2009 

we also have established a number of our own innovative safety and securityoriented initiatives ranging from various investments in technology to the officer on the train program which provides local law enforcement officers with the opportunity to ride with train crews to enhance their understanding of railroad operations and risks 

cooperation with federal state and local government agencies – we work closely with government agencies ranging from the dot and the department of homeland security dhs to local police departments fire departments and other first responders in conjunction with the dot dhs and other railroads we sponsor operation respond which provides first responders with secure links to electronic railroad resources including mapping systems shipment records and other essential information required by emergency personnel to respond to accidents and other situations we also participate in the national joint terrorism task force a multiagency effort established by the justice department and the federal bureau of investigation to combat and prevent terrorism 

we work with the coast guard us customs and border protection cbp formerly the us customs service and the military transport management command to monitor shipments entering the uprr rail network at us border crossings and ports we were the first railroad in the united states to be named a partner in cbp’s customstrade partnership against terrorism ctpat a partnership designed to develop enhance and maintain effective security processes throughout the global supply chain 

cooperation with customers and trade associations – along with other railroads we work with the american chemistry council to train more than 200000 emergency responders each year we work closely with our chemical shippers to establish plant security plans and continue to take steps to more closely monitor and track hazardous materials shipments in cooperation with the federal railroad administration fra and other railroads we are also working to develop an improved tank car design that will further limit the risk of releases of hazardous materials 

governmental and environmental regulation 

governmental regulation – our operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local regulations generally applicable to all businesses see also the discussion of certain regulatory proceedings in legal proceedings item 3 

the operations of the railroad are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the stb the operations of the railroad are also subject to the regulations of the fra and other federal and state agencies the stb has jurisdiction over rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic common carrier service of regulated traffic freight car compensation transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines and acquisition of control of rail common carriers on january 26 2007 the stb issued a decision limiting the manner in which us railroads can calculate fuel surcharges on traffic regulated by the stb and we have complied with this regulation the stb also has adopted new mechanisms for regulating some of our rates adopted a new methodology for calculating the cost of capital for railroads and expanded its review of line sales and leases various appeals may affect these regulations prior to final implementation 

dot the occupational safety and health administration and the dhs along with other federal agencies have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety movement of hazardous materials movement 

  

and disposal of hazardous waste emissions requirements and equipment standards on october 16 2008 the president signed the rail safety improvement act of 2008 into the law which among other things revises hours of service rules for train and certain other railroad employees mandates implementation of positive train control a collision avoidance technology that can override locomotive controls and stop a train before an accident by the end of 2015 addresses safety at rail crossings increases the number of safety related employees of the fra and increases fines that may be levied against railroads for safety violations additionally various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law 

environmental regulation – we are subject to extensive federal and state environmental statutes and regulations pertaining to public health and the environment the statutes and regulations are administered and monitored by the environmental protection agency epa and by various state environmental agencies the primary laws affecting our operations are the resource conservation and recovery act regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act regulating the cleanup of contaminated properties the clean air act regulating air emissions and the clean water act regulating waste water discharges 

information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies – environmental item 7 




 item 1a risk factors 

the information set forth in this item 1a should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this report including item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

we may be affected by general economic conditions – either or both of prolonged and severe adverse domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of either or both of the financial and credit markets including the availability of short and longterm debt financing may affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to significant governmental regulation – we are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal state and local authorities covering a variety of health safety labor environmental economic as discussed below and other matters many laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses permits and other authorizations and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us governments may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate without providing us any recourse to address any adverse effects on our business including without limitation regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution business relationships with other railroads calculation of our cost of capital or other inputs relevant to determining or estimating our revenue adequacy and costs and expenses in recent years there has been a significant level of legislative activity involving proposed bills in congress and state legislatures seeking to reregulate various aspects of railroad operations as part of the rail safety improvement act of 2008 railroad carriers must implement positive train control a collision avoidance technology that can override locomotive controls and stop a train before an accident by the end of 2015 which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity increased regulation of the rail industry likely would restrict our ability to determine prices for certain rail services affect our ability to control traffic volume and reduce capital spending on our rail network facilities and equipment resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

additionally one or more consolidations of class i railroads could lead to increased regulation of the rail industry 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures – the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage environmental liability and other matters any material changes to litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving any or all of property damage personal injury and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are required to transport hazardous materials – federal laws require railroads including us to transport hazardous materials regardless of risk or potential exposure of loss any rail accident or other incident or accident on our network at our facilities or at the facilities of our customers involving the release of hazardous materials including toxic inhalation hazard or tih materials such as certain chlorine compounds could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury property damage and environmental penalties and remediation which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures – severe weather conditions events and other natural phenomena including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods mudslides or landslides extreme temperatures and significant precipitation may cause business interruptions including line outages on our rail network that can adversely affect our entire rail network and result in increased costs increased liabilities and decreased revenue which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations – we rely on information technology in all aspects of our business if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if we are unable to implement new technology we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally if we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment we could experience a service interruption safety failure security breach or other operational difficulties which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we face competition from other railroads and other transportation providers – we face competition from other railroads motor carriers ships barges and pipelines in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service while we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation or legislation releasing motor carriers from their size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect the competitive environment in which we operate 

we must manage fluctuating demand for our services and network capacity – if there is significant demand for our services that exceeds the designed capacity of our network we may experience network difficulties including congestion and reduced velocity that could compromise the level of service we provide to our customers this level of demand may also compound the impact of weather and weatherrelated events on our operations and velocity although we continue to improve our transportation plan add capacity and improve operations at our yards and other facilities we cannot be sure that these measures will fully or adequately address any service shortcomings resulting from demand exceeding our planned capacity we may experience other operational or service difficulties related to network 

  

capacity dramatic and unplanned increases or decreases of demand for rail service with respect to one or more of our commodity groups or other events that could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in the event that we experience significant reductions of demand for rail services with respect to one or more of our commodity groups we may experience increased costs associated with resizing our operations including higher unit operating costs and costs for the storage of locomotives rail cars and other equipment workforce adjustments and other related activities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we utilize capital markets – due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate a safe and efficient railroad we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements including the issuance of longterm debt instruments and commercial paper from timetotime as well as the sale of certain of our receivables significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets including the credit markets or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to and significantly increase the cost of commercial paper and other financing sources including bank credit facilities and the issuance of longterm debt including corporate bonds any of these factors alone or in combination could also result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade which could prohibit or restrict us from utilizing our current sale of receivables program or accessing external sources of short and longterm debt financing and significantly increase the costs associated with utilizing a sale of receivables program and issuing both commercial paper and longterm debt 

strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations as the majority of our employees belong to labor unions and labor agreements – we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in among other things strikes work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers if unionized workers were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown or other employees were to become unionized we could experience a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could compromise our service reliability and significantly increase our costs for healthcare wages and other benefits which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to significant environmental laws and regulations – our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waters handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and hazardous material or petroleum releases we generate and transport hazardous and nonhazardous waste in our operations and we did so in our former operations environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties leased properties and properties owned by third parties as well as to properties we currently own environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation we have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated or are strictly liable under these laws or regulations we could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we may be affected by climate change and market or regulatory responses to climate change – climate change including the impact of global warming could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gasses including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating costs 

  

restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that a use commodities that we carry to produce energy b use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry or c manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels including chemical producers farmers and food producers and automakers and other manufacturers significant cost increases government regulation or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns including for example the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers finally we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change any of these factors individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

rising or elevated fuel costs and whether we are able to mitigate these costs with fuel surcharges could materially and adversely affect our business – fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses diesel fuel prices are subject to dramatic fluctuations and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results although we currently are able to recover a significant amount of our increased fuel expenses through revenue from fuel surcharges we cannot be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elevated fuel costs through surcharges future market conditions or legislative or regulatory activities could adversely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharges or adequately recover increased fuel costs through fuel surcharges international political and economic circumstances affect fuel prices and supplies weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity if a fuel supply shortage were to arise higher fuel prices could despite our fuel surcharge programs have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

the availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations – changes in demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to meet demand for rail service unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to legislative regulatory and legal developments involving taxes – taxes are a significant part of our expenses we are subject to federal and state income payroll property sales and use fuel and other types of taxes changes in tax rates enactment of new tax laws revisions of tax regulations and claims or litigation with taxing authorities could result in substantially higher taxes and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are dependent on certain key suppliers of locomotives and rail – due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry with respect to locomotive manufacturing therefore if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience significant cost increases and reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations additionally there are two key suppliers of rail which is critical for rail replacement programs maintenance and for adding additional network capacity new rail and storage yards and expansions of existing facilities this industry similarly has high barriers to entry and if one of these suppliers discontinues operations for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience both 

  

significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail for maintenance and other projects 

we may be affected by acts of terrorism war or risk of war – our rail lines facilities and equipment including rail cars carrying hazardous materials could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks terrorist attacks or other similar events any government response thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in addition insurance premiums for some or all of our current coverages could increase dramatically or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future

 harriman dispatching center – the harriman dispatching center hdc located in omaha nebraska is our primary dispatching facility it is linked to regional dispatching and locomotive management facilities at various locations along our network the hdc moves locomotives and trains manages traffic on our network and coordinates interchanges with other railroads over 1000 employees currently work onsite in the facility 

rail facilities – in addition to our track structure we operate numerous facilities including terminals for intermodal and other freight rail yards for trainbuilding classification yards switching storageintransit the temporary storage of customer goods in rail cars prior to shipment and other activities offices to administer and manage our operations dispatch centers to direct traffic on our rail network crew quarters to house train crews along our network and shops and other facilities for fueling maintenance and repair of locomotives and repair and maintenance of rail cars and other equipment the following tables include the major yards and terminals on our system 

 

   

 rail equipment – our equipment includes owned and leased locomotives and rail cars heavy maintenance equipment and machinery other equipment and tools in our shops offices and facilities and vehicles for transportation of crews and other activities as of december 31 2008 we owned or leased the following units of equipment 

 

 capital expenditures – our rail network requires significant annual capital investments for replacement improvement and expansion these investments enhance safety support the transportation needs of our customers and improve our operational efficiency additionally we add new locomotives and freight cars to our fleet to replace older less efficient equipment to support growth and customer demand and to reduce our impact on the environment through the acquisition of more fuel efficient and lowemission locomotives 

2008 capital expenditures – during 2008 we made capital investments totaling 31 billion which included cash spending of 28 billion see the capital expenditures table in management’s discussion 

  

and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources – financial condition item 7 our capital plan included the acquisition of 82 locomotives 300 freight cars and 2000 intermodal containers acquired under longterm operating leases with an aggregate net present value of 178 million we also acquired 83 locomotives through capital lease financings valued at 175 million 

infrastructure expansion – one of our critical routes is the sunset corridor a 760mile route running between los angeles and el paso texas this heavily traveled corridor carries about 20 percent of our traffic including a significant amount of intermodal traffic in 2008 we added 45 miles of double track to the corridor which now includes nearly 455 miles of double track approximately 60 of the route to support anticipated growth on the sunset corridor as well as our other key routes we continue to upgrade and add terminal capacity during 2008 we opened a new intermodal facility at san antonio texas and acquired property for the construction of a new intermodal facility in joliet illinois 

an important part of our franchise is our access to the coalproducing sprb through a line that we jointly own with bnsf the joint line in addition to the significant annual replacement required on the joint line due to the volume of trains the weight of loaded coal cars and the impact of coal dust on rail beds a capacity expansion project is underway during 2008 we added approximately 20 miles of track on the joint line now making those sections quadruple tracked as well as approximately 10 miles of triple track on our line into the sprb 

2009 capital expenditures – in 2009 we expect to make capital investments of approximately 28 billion which may be revised if business conditions or new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments see discussion of our 2009 capital plan in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – 2009 outlook item 7

as a result of the merger of missouri pacific railroad company mprr with and into uprr on january 1 1997 and pursuant to the underlying indentures for the mprr mortgage bonds uprr must maintain the same value of assets after the merger in order to comply with the security requirements of the mortgage bonds as of the merger date the value of the mprr assets that secured the mortgage bonds was approximately 60 billion in accordance with the terms of the indentures this collateral value must be maintained during the entire term of the mortgage bonds irrespective of the outstanding balance of such bonds 

certain of our properties are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment see discussion of environmental issues in business – governmental and environmental regulation item 1 and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies – environmental item 7 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation that occur in connection with our business we routinely assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest available information and when necessary we seek input from our thirdparty advisors when making these assessments consistent with sec rules and requirements we describe below material pending legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities other proceedings arising 

  

under federal state or local environmental laws and regulations including governmental proceedings involving potential fines penalties or other monetary sanctions in excess of 100000 and such other pending matters that we may determine to be appropriate 

environmental matters 

as we reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2007 the railroad received notice from the army corps of engineers the corps that during its construction efforts to restore service to the caliente subdivision after severe flooding in january 2005 the railroad may have exceeded its authority under emergency authorizations and permits issued by the corps subsequently the corps referred the matter to the epa which has demanded that the railroad repair claimed impacts to the adjacent waterway perform compensatory mitigation and pay a civil penalty in connection with this project and related storm water issues the railroad and the epa have discussed the scope of additional work to be performed by the railroad to address alleged impacts of its construction activities as well as compensatory mitigation and potential penalties to date we have not reached a final agreement with the epa and therefore the ultimate amount of the civil penalty cannot be determined however the penalty component of the settlement will exceed 100000 

as we reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2004 the illinois attorney general’s office filed an agreed order and complaint and a complaint for injunctive and other relief on october 7 2004 in the circuit court for the twentieth judicial circuit st clair county against the alton  southern railway company a whollyowned subsidiary of the railroad as a result of a collision and derailment on september 21 2004 the state of illinois sought to enjoin the alton  southern railway company from further violations as well as payment of a monetary penalty the railroad executed an agreement to settle this matter with the state of illinois once it is approved by the court the agreement will require payment of a penalty in the amount of 48000 

as we reported in our annual report on form 10k for 2005 the epa considers the railroad a potentially responsible party for the omaha lead site the omaha lead site consists of approximately 25 square miles of residential property in the eastern part of omaha nebraska allegedly impacted by air emissions from two former lead smeltersrefineries one refinery was operated by asarco the epa identified the railroad as a potentially responsible party because more than 60 years ago the railroad owned land that was leased to asarco the railroad disputes both the legal and technical basis of the epa’s allegations it has nonetheless engaged in extensive negotiations with the epa these negotiations reached an apparent impasse the epa issued a unilateral administrative order with an effective date of december 16 2005 directing the railroad to implement an interim remedy at the site at an estimated cost of 50 million failure to comply with the order without just cause could subject the railroad to penalties of up to 32500 per day and triple the epa’s costs in performing the work the railroad believes it has just cause not to comply with the order but it offered to perform some of the work specified in the order as a compromise to date the epa has rejected all of the railroad’s offers to settle or resolve this matter the railroad will vigorously contest liability and the imposition of any penalties 

as we reported in our annual report on form 10k for 2005 the illinois attorney general’s office filed a complaint in the circuit court for the twentieth judicial circuit st clair county for injunctive and other relief on november 28 2005 against the railroad alleging a diesel fuel spill from an aboveground storage tank in a rail yard in dupo st clair county illinois the state of illinois seeks to enjoin uprr from further violations and a monetary penalty the amount of the proposed penalty although uncertain could exceed 100000 

as we reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2008 the railroad received notice from the united states department of justice on may 8 2008 indicating its intent to file suit for civil penalties in connection with a march 6 2005 derailment near kamela oregon the derailment resulted in the release of approximately 900 gallons of diesel fuel from ruptured fuel tanks of 

  

derailed refrigerator cars some of this fuel entered dry creek a tributary to the grande ronde river while the amount of the ultimate penalty is uncertain it could exceed 100000 

as we reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2008 the railroad has been engaged in discussions with the united states attorney for the district of utah and the utah attorney general concerning the transfer of certain engineering signal huts to a recycler in salt lake city in september 2005 the epa the united states attorney and the utah attorney general contend that the railroad failed to provide predemolition notification pursuant to the national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants neshaps prior to removing those huts from their foundations the railroad maintains that the predemolition notification requirements of the neshaps do not apply to the removal of these signal huts the railroad and the government have reached an agreement in principal involving a proposed consent decree under which the railroad will pay a civil penalty in the amount of 200000 plus approximately 28000 in investigative costs 

on april 26 2007 the colorado department of public health and environment issued a notice of violationcease and desist order to the railroad in connection with certain alleged violations of the railroad’s stormwater permits at its burnham shops and north yard facilities in denver colorado the order required the railroad among other things to evaluate the effectiveness of the best management practices bmps that were in place to control stormwater and pollutant discharges from the regulated portions of those facilities take appropriate remedial actions implement additional bmps to control the discharge of pollutants at each of the facilities and report the results of its evaluation and demonstrate compliance with its stormwater permits to the agency in october 2008 the state indicated that it would pursue a civil penalty in connection with the alleged permit violations noted in the order the amount of any such penalty is uncertain but could exceed 100000 

we received notices from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are or may be liable under federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the united states including sites on the superfund national priorities list or state superfund lists we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings and suits because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs 

information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies – environmental item 7 

other matters 

as we reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2007 20 small rail shippers many of whom are represented by the same law firms filed virtually identical antitrust lawsuits in various federal district courts against us and four other class i railroads in the us the original plaintiff filed the first of these claims in the us district court in new jersey on may 14 2007 and the additional plaintiffs filed claims in district courts in various states including florida illinois alabama pennsylvania and the district of columbia these suits allege that the named railroads engaged in pricefixing by establishing common fuel surcharges for certain rail traffic 

we received additional complaints following the initial claim increasing the total number of complaints to 30 in addition to suits filed by direct purchasers of rail transportation a few of the suits involve plaintiffs alleging that they are or were indirect purchasers of rail transportation and seek to represent a purported class of indirect purchasers of rail transportation that paid fuel surcharges these complaints have added allegations under state antitrust and consumer protection laws on november 6 2007 the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation ordered that all of the rail fuel surcharge cases be transferred to judge paul friedman of the us district court in dc for coordinated or consolidated pretrial 

  

proceedings subsequently the direct purchaser plaintiffs and the indirect purchaser plaintiffs filed consolidated amended class action complaints against uprr and three other class i railroads 

one additional shipper filed a separate antitrust suit during 2008 subsequently the shipper voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice 

on october 10 2008 judge friedman heard oral arguments with respect to the defendant railroads’ motions to dismiss in a ruling delivered on november 7 2008 judge friedman denied the motion with respect to the direct purchasers’ complaint and therefore that case will proceed to discovery on december 31 2008 judge friedman ruled that the allegations of the indirect purchasers based upon state antitrust consumer protection and unjust enrichment laws must be dismissed he also ruled however that the plaintiffs can proceed with their claim for injunctive relief under the federal antitrust laws which is identical to a claim by the direct purchaser plaintiffs 

additionally the attorney general of new jersey issued a grand jury subpoena to us requesting documents pertaining to our fuel surcharge programs we met with representatives of the attorney general’s office in an effort to resolve their interest in this matter on july 9 2008 the attorney general’s office advised us that it is not moving forward with the criminal investigation at this time but is reserving the right to reopen the investigation if circumstances warrant 

we deny the allegations that our fuel surcharge programs violate the antitrust laws or any other laws we believe that these lawsuits are without merit and we will vigorously defend our actions therefore we currently believe that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on any of our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

 results of operations 

operating revenues 

 

 freight revenues are revenues generated by transporting freight or other materials from our six commodity groups freight revenues vary with volume carloads and average revenue per car arc arc is driven by changes in price traffic mix and fuel surcharges as a result of contractual obligations with some of our customers we have provided incentives for meeting or exceeding specified cumulative volumes or shipping to and from specific locations which we record as a reduction to freight revenues based on the actual or projected future shipments we recognize freight revenues on a percentageofcompletion basis as freight moves from origin to destination we allocate freight revenues between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them 

other revenues include revenues earned by our subsidiaries revenues from our commuter rail operations and accessorial revenues which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us or when we perform additional services such as switching or storage we recognize other revenues as we perform services or meet contractual obligations 

freight revenues from five of the six commodity groups increased during 2008 with particularly strong growth from agricultural and energy shipments while revenues generated from chemical and industrial products shipments grew in 2008 compared to 2007 hurricanes gustav and ike reduced shipments of these commodities revenues generated from automotive shipments declined versus 2007 greater fuel cost recoveries and core pricing improvement combined to increase arc during 2008 fuel cost recoveries include fuel surcharge revenue and the impact of resetting the base fuel price for certain traffic as described below in more detail the severe economic downturn during the fourth quarter compounded already declining volumes experienced during the first nine months of 2008 due to ongoing weakness in certain market sectors as a result we moved fewer intermodal automotive industrial products and chemical shipments which more than offset volume growth from agricultural and energy shipments 

our fuel surcharge programs excluding indexbased contract escalators that contain some provision for fuel generated 23 billion in freight revenues during 2008 fuel surcharge revenue is not comparable to prior periods due to the implementation of new mileagebased fuel surcharge programs beginning in april 2007 for regulated traffic as previously disclosed in our 2006 annual report on form 10k the stb 

  

issued a decision limiting the manner in which us railroads can calculate fuel surcharges on traffic regulated by the stb effective april 26 2007 we implemented new fuel surcharge programs covering this regulated traffic which represents approximately 19 of our revenue base these new programs use mileage as opposed to percent of revenue as the basis for calculating fuel surcharges and they use the onhighway diesel price index – published by the energy information administration – for purposes of determining fuel costs the new programs affect fuel surcharges assessed for certain shipments of agricultural chemical and industrial products and to a lesser extent coal in addition we reset the effective base fuel price at which our new mileagebased fuel surcharge programs take effect resulting in a higher starting point of 230 per gallon versus 135 per gallon we also converted a portion of our nonregulated traffic to mileagebased fuel surcharge programs the resetting of the fuel price at which the fuel surcharge begins in conjunction with rebasing the affected transportation rates to include a portion of what had been in the fuel surcharge did not materially change our freight revenues as higher base rates offset lower fuel surcharge revenue 

freight revenues from five of our six commodity groups increased during 2007 while revenues generated from industrial products shipments declined arc increased 6 during 2007 driven by core price improvement lower shipments of industrial and agricultural products drove volume down 1 in 2007 more than offsetting an increase in chemical shipments our fuel surcharge programs excluding indexbased contract escalators that contain some provision for fuel generated 15 billion in freight revenues in 2007 fuel surcharge revenues are not comparable to prior periods due to implementation of new mileagebased fuel surcharge programs for certain traffic as described above 

other revenues increased in 2008 versus 2007 driven by higher revenues from both our commuter rail operations and our subsidiary that brokers intermodal services accessorial revenues also increased in both periods due to improved collection rates 

the following tables summarize the yearoveryear changes in freight revenues revenue carloads and arc by commodity type 

 

   

  

  

   

  

   

  

 price increases improved intermodal revenue in 2007 compared to 2006 volume was flat versus 2006 as increased domestic traffic due to new service offerings and increased business under some of our older longterm contracts were offset by a decrease of premium shipments international traffic was flat in 2007 compared to 2006 due to general softening of imports from asia 

mexico business – the results for each commodity group include shipments to and from mexico revenue from mexico business increased 13 to 16 billion in 2008 compared to 2007 price improvements and fuel surcharges contributed to these increases partially offset by a 4 decline in volume in 2008 compared to 2007 

revenue from mexico business increased 5 to 144 billion in 2007 compared to 2006 price increases and more shipments of automotive parts and intermodal containers drove revenue growth in 2007 

  

volume declines in cement some agricultural products and newsprint shipments partially offset the increases 

operating expenses 

 

  

 compensation and benefits – compensation and benefits include wages payroll taxes health and welfare costs pension costs other postretirement benefits and incentive costs productivity initiatives in all areas combined with lower volume led to a 4 decline in our workforce for 2008 saving 227 million compared to 2007 conversely general wage and benefit inflation and higher pension and postretirement benefits increased expenses in 2008 partially offsetting these reductions 

operational improvements and lower volume levels in 2007 led to a 1 decline in our workforce saving 79 million in 2007 compared to 2006 a smaller workforce and less need for new train personnel reduced training costs during the year which contributed to the improvement general wage and benefit inflation mostly offset the reductions reflecting higher salaries and wages and the impact of higher healthcare and other benefit costs 

fuel – fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and nonhighway vehicles and heavy equipment diesel fuel prices which averaged 315 per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in 2008 compared to 227 per gallon in 2007 increased expenses by 11 billion a 4 improvement in our fuel consumption rate resulted in 136 million of cost savings due to the use of newer more fuel 

  

efficient locomotives our fuel conservation programs improved network operations and a shift in commodity mix primarily due to growth in bulk shipments volume as measured by gross tonmiles decreased 3 in the year lowering expenses by 101 million compared to 2007 

higher diesel fuel prices which averaged 227 per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in 2007 compared to 209 per gallon in 2006 increased expenses by 244 million a 2 improvement of our fuel consumption rate resulting from the use of newer more fuelefficient locomotives and our fuel conservation programs reduced fuel expense by 44 million and a 2 decrease of gross ton miles reduced fuel expense by an additional 54 million 

purchased services and materials – purchased services and materials expense includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors materials used to maintain the railroad’s lines structures and equipment costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other railroads transportation and lodging for train crew employees trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers leased automobile maintenance expenses and tools and supplies in 2008 higher contract costs including restoration costs related to the january cascade mudslide june midwest flooding and september hurricanes increased expenses 40 million compared to 2007 higher material costs for freight car wheel sets during the year and an increase in the number of wheel sets required to repair flooddamaged freight cars also contributed to higher materials expense in 2008 conversely rail scrap proceeds associated with our rail replacement program partially offset these increases for the year 

higher consulting fees and higher contract expenses including equipment maintenance increased costs by 58 million in 2007 compared to 2006 crew transportation and lodging costs increased 17 million in 2007 due to higher gas prices and rate inflation increased use of higher cost components to repair and maintain our fleet of locomotives including a growing number of units not covered by warranties added 32 million to materials expense during 2007 conversely we used fewer parts for freight car repairs due to program maintenance scheduling which lowered costs by 11 million in 2007 compared to 2006 we also incurred lower drayage expense in 2007 compared to 2006 

depreciation – the majority of depreciation relates to track structure including rail ties and other track material a higher depreciable asset base reflecting higher capital spending in recent years increased depreciation expense in 2008 versus 2007 and in 2007 versus 2006 

equipment and other rents – equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies freight car intermodal and locomotive leases other specialty equipment leases and office and other rentals fewer shipments of finished vehicles industrial products and intermodal containers reduced our short term freight car rental expense by 62 million in 2008 compared to 2007 lower lease expense for freight cars intermodal containers and locomotives also decreased costs conversely lease expense for fleet vehicles increased costs in 2008 compared to 2007 

fewer shipments of industrial products combined with improved carcycle times which reflect operational improvement and better asset utilization reduced our shortterm freight car rental expense by 46 million in 2007 compared to 2006 lower lease expenses for freight cars intermodal containers and fleet vehicles and equipment decreased costs by 20 million in 2007 conversely higher locomotive lease expense resulted in a 33 million increase in costs during the year 

other – other costs include personal injury costs freight and property damage insurance environmental expense state and local taxes utilities telephone and cellular expenses employee travel expense and computer software and other general expenses other costs were higher in 2008 compared to 2007 due to an increase in bad debts state and local taxes utility costs and other miscellaneous expenses totaling 110 million conversely casualty expenses including costs for personal injuries asbestosrelated claims freight and property damage insurance and environmental costs were 3 million lower in 2008 

  

compared to 2007 we reduced personal injury expense by 80 million in 2007 as a result of fewer than expected claims and lower than expected average settlement costs in 2008 we reduced personal injury expense and asbestosrelated costs 82 million based on the results of updated personal injury actuarial studies and a reassessment of our potential liability for resolution of current and future asbestos claims in addition environmental and toxic tort expenses were 7 million lower in 2008 compared to 2007 

other costs were lower in 2007 compared to 2006 driven primarily by a reduction in personal injury expense actuarial studies completed during 2007 resulted in a reduction in personal injury expense of 80 million which was partially offset by an adverse development with respect to one claim settlement of insurance claims in 2007 related to hurricane rita and higher equity income also drove expenses lower in 2007 versus 2006 conversely the yearoveryear comparison was affected by the settlement of insurance claims totaling 23 million in 2006 related to the january 2005 west coast storm and a 9 million gain in 2006 from the sale of two companyowned airplanes 

nonoperating items 

 

 other income – other income decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to lower gains from real estate sales and decreased returns on cash investments reflecting lower interest rates higher rental and licensing income and lower interest expense on our sale of receivables program partially offset the decreases 

lower net gains from nonoperating asset sales primarily real estate drove the reduction in other income in 2007 recognition of rental income in 2006 from the settlement of a rent dispute also contributed to the yearoveryear decrease in other income cash investment returns increased 21 million due to larger cash balances and higher interest rates 

interest expense – interest expense increased in 2008 versus 2007 due to a higher weightedaverage debt level of 83 billion compared to 73 billion in 2007 a lower effective interest rate of 61 in 2008 compared to 66 in 2007 partially offset the effects of the higher weightedaverage debt level 

an increase in the weightedaverage debt levels to 73 billion from 71 billion in 2006 generated higher interest expense in 2007 a lower effective interest rate of 66 in 2007 compared to 67 in 2006 partially offset the effects of the higher debt level 

income taxes – income taxes were higher in 2008 compared to 2007 driven by higher pretax income our effective tax rates were 361 and 384 in 2008 and 2007 respectively the lower effective tax rate in 2008 resulted from several reductions in tax expense related to federal audits and state tax law changes in addition the effective tax rate in 2007 was increased by illinois legislation that increased deferred tax expense in the third quarter of 2007 

income taxes were 235 million higher in 2007 compared to 2006 due primarily to higher pretax income and the effect of new tax legislation in the state of illinois that changed how we determine the amount of our income subject to illinois tax the illinois legislation increased our deferred tax expense by 27 million in 2007 our effective tax rates were 384 and 364 in 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  

other operatingperformance and financial statistics 

we report key railroad performance measures weekly to the association of american railroads aar including carloads average daily inventory of rail cars on our system average train speed and average terminal dwell time we provide this data on our website at wwwupcominvestorsreportsindexshtml 

operatingperformance statistics 

included in the table below are railroad performance measures reported to the aar 

 

 average train speed – average train speed is calculated by dividing train miles by hours operated on our main lines between terminals ongoing network management initiatives productivity improvements and lower volume levels contributed to 8 and 2 improvements in average train speed in 2008 and 2007 respectively 

average terminal dwell time – average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our terminals lower average terminal dwell time improves asset utilization and service average terminal dwell time improved 1 and 8 in 2008 and 2007 respectively lower volumes combined with initiatives to more timely deliver rail cars to our interchange partners and customers improved dwell time in both periods 

gross and revenue tonmiles – gross tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled revenue tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles gross tonmiles decreased 3 while revenue tonmiles were flat in 2008 compared to 2007 with commodity mix changes notably autos and coal explaining the variance in year over year growth between the two metrics in 2007 revenue tonmiles declined 1 in relation to the 1 reduction in carloadings compared to 2006 gross tonmiles decreased 2 in 2007 driven by a mix shift in freight shipments 

operating ratio – operating ratio is defined as our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue our operating ratios improved 20 points to 773 in 2008 and 22 points to 793 in 2007 price increases fuel cost recoveries network management initiatives and improved productivity more than offset the impact of higher fuel prices 

employees – productivity initiatives and lower volumes reduced employee levels throughout the company in 2008 versus 2007 fewer train and engine personnel due to improved network productivity and 5 lower volume drove the change while productivity initiatives within the support organizations also contributed to a lower fulltime equivalent force level lower employee levels in 2007 versus 2006 

  

resulted from fewer train and engine personnel due to improved network productivity and 1 lower volume levels partially offset by more employees maintaining our larger locomotive fleet 

customer satisfaction index – the customer satisfaction survey asks customers to rate how satisfied they are with our performance over the last 12 months on a variety of attributes a higher score indicates higher customer satisfaction the improvement in survey results in 2008 and 2007 generally reflects customer recognition of our improving service 

return on average common shareholders’ equity 

 

 roic is considered a nongaap financial measure by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner we believe this measure is important in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the corporation’s longterm capital investments and we currently use roic as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of equity compensation for our executives roic should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for other information provided in accordance with gaap the most comparable gaap measure is return on average common shareholders’ equity the tables above provide a reconciliation from return on average common shareholders’ equity to roic our 2008 roic improved 15 points compared to 2007 primarily as a result of higher earnings partially offset by a 11 billion increase in average debt 

  

debt to capital  adjusted debt to capital 

 

  

 adjusted debt to capital is a nongaap financial measure under sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk we believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the total amount of leverage in our capital structure including offbalance sheet lease obligations which we generally incur in connection with financing the acquisition of locomotives and freight cars and certain facilities we monitor the ratio of adjusted debt to capital as we manage our capital structure to balance costeffective and efficient access to the capital markets with the corporation’s overall cost of capital adjusted debt to capital should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for debt to capital the tables above provide a reconciliation from debt to capital to adjusted debt to capital our december 31 2008 debt to capital ratios increased as a result of a 12 billion net increase in debt from december 31 2007 and purchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program partially offset by an increase in retained earnings due to higher earnings in 2008 equity at december 31 2008 was reduced by 704 million for other comprehensive losses equity at december 31 2007 was reduced by 74 million for other comprehensive losses other comprehensive losses in both years were related primarily to pensions see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for more information 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2008 our principal sources of liquidity included cash cash equivalents the sale of certain receivables and our revolving credit facility as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets we had 19 billion of committed credit available under our credit facility with no borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2008 we did not make any borrowings under this facility during the year the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the sale of receivables program was 584 million as of december 31 2008 the sale of receivables program is subject to certain requirements including maintenance of an investment grade bond rating if our bond rating were to deteriorate it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financings is dependent on market conditions deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to utilize commercial paper as a source of liquidity access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability although both short and long 

  

term debt including commercial paper bank provided credit and publicly issued bonds are more expensive than in recent years we currently have access to liquidity through commercial paper and our credit facility we also expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity by issuing bonds to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets and recent debt transactions including our issuance of longterm debt during the fourth quarter 

at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 we had a working capital deficit of approximately 100 million and 400 million respectively a working capital deficit is common in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity we maintain adequate resources and when necessary have access to capital to meet any daily and shortterm cash requirements and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

 

 operating activities 

higher net income in 2008 and changes in working capital combined to increase cash provided by operating activities in addition accelerated tax deductions enacted in 2008 on certain new operating assets resulted in lower income tax payments in 2008 voluntary pension contributions in 2008 totaling 200 million and other pension contributions of 8 million partially offset the yearoveryear increase higher net income in 2007 was the primary driver of increased cash provided by operating activities a favorable comparison due to voluntary pension contributions in 2006 totaling 150 million also contributed to the yearoveryear increase these increases were partially offset by cash payments representing prior period wage increases in accordance with recent union contract ratifications and higher income tax payments 

investing activities 

increased capital investments and lower proceeds from asset sales drove the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2008 compared to 2007 higher capital investments and work in process balances drove the increase in cash used in investing in 2007 versus 2006 

the table below details cash capital investments for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 capital plan – in 2009 we expect our total capital investments to be approximately 28 billion which may be revised if business conditions or new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient 

  

returns on these investments we expect approximately 80 of our 2009 capital investments will replace and renew existing capital assets major investment categories include replacement and improvement of track infrastructure increasing network and terminal capacity locomotive and freight car fleet including the acquisition of 125 highhorsepower locomotives and technology improvements including the testing of positive train control and other capital projects we expect to fund our 2009 cash capital investments through cash generated from operations the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties issuance of longterm debt and cash on hand at december 31 2008 our annual capital plan is a critical component of our longterm strategic plan which we expect will enhance the longterm value of the corporation for our shareholders by providing sufficient resources to i replace and improve our existing track infrastructure to provide safe and fluid operations ii increase network efficiency by adding or improving facilities and track and iii make investments that meet customer demand and take advantage of opportunities for longterm growth 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities increased in 2008 versus 2007 due to higher debt repayments of 416 million an increase of 234 million for the repurchase of common shares see further discussion of common shares in market for the registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  purchases of equity securities part ii item 5 and an increase of dividends paid reflecting a higher quarterly dividend higher debt issuances of 676 million partially offset these increases the increase in cash used in financing activities in 2007 resulted primarily from the use of 14 billion to repurchase common shares payment of higher dividends and lower net proceeds from equity compensation plans 71 million in 2007 compared to 160 million in 2006 these increases were mostly offset by debt issuances of 16 billion in 2007 compared to no issuances in 2006 

credit facilities – on december 31 2008 we had 19 billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility the facility the facility is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper we did not draw on the facility during 2008 commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investmentgrade borrowers the facility allows borrowings at floating rates based on london interbank offered rates plus a spread depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings the facility requires union pacific corporation to maintain a debttonetworth coverage ratio as a condition to making a borrowing at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 and at all times during these periods we were in compliance with this covenant 

the definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the debttonetworth coverage ratio includes among other things certain credit arrangements capital leases guarantees and unfunded and vested pension benefits under title iv of erisa at december 31 2008 the debttonetworth coverage ratio allowed us to carry up to 309 billion of debt as defined in the facility and we had 99 billion of debt as defined in the facility outstanding at that date under our current capital plans we expect to continue to satisfy the debttonetworth coverage ratio however many factors beyond our reasonable control including the risk factors in item 1a of this report could affect our ability to comply with this provision in the future the facility does not include any other financial restrictions credit rating triggers other than ratingdependent pricing or any other provision that could require us to post collateral the facility also includes a 75 million crossdefault provision and a changeofcontrol provision the term of the facility will expire in april 2012 and we currently intend to replace the facility with a substantially similar credit agreement on or before the expiration date which is consistent with our past practices with respect to our credit facilities 

at december 31 2008 we had 100 million of commercial paper outstanding our commercial paper balance is supported by our revolving credit facility but does not reduce the amount of borrowings available under the facility during 2008 we issued 600 million of commercial paper including 300 

  

million issued in september and october as the credit and financial markets deteriorated and repaid 500 million 

at december 31 2008 we reclassified as longterm debt approximately 400 million of debt due within one year that we intend to refinance this reclassification reflected our ability and intent to refinance any shortterm borrowings and certain current maturities of longterm debt on a longterm basis at december 31 2007 we reclassified as longterm debt approximately 550 million of debt due within one year that we intended to refinance at that time 

operating lease activities 

during 2008 the railroad as lessee entered into longterm operating lease arrangements covering 82 locomotives 300 rail cars and 2000 intermodal containers with a total equipment cost of approximately 219 million in total these new lease arrangements will provide for minimum rental payments of approximately 309 million with a present value of approximately 178 million 

the lessors financed the purchase of the locomotives rail cars and intermodal containers in part by issuing equipment notes that are nonrecourse to the railroad and are secured by assignments of the underlying leases and security interests in the equipment the corporation and the railroad do not guaranty payment of the equipment notes the railroad’s obligations to make operating lease payments under the leases are recourse obligations and are not recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position 

the railroad has certain renewal and purchase options with respect to the locomotives rail cars and intermodal containers if the railroad does not exercise these options the equipment will be returned to the lessors at the end of the lease term 

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

for each of the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 59 51 and 44 respectively higher net income drove the increases in 2008 and 2007 the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis earnings represent income from continuing operations less equity earnings net of distributions plus fixed charges and income taxes fixed charges represent interest charges amortization of debt discount and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges see exhibit 12 to this report for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

common shareholders’ equity 

dividends – on july 31 2008 we increased the quarterly dividend to 027 per share payable beginning on october 1 2008 to shareholders of record on august 29 2008 we funded the increase in the quarterly dividend through cash generated from operations the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties and cash on hand during the fourth quarter 

dividend restrictions – our revolving credit facility includes a debttonet worth covenant that under certain circumstances restricts the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders the amount of retained earnings available for dividends was 105 billion and 115 billion at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

stock split – on may 28 2008 we completed a twoforone stock split effected in the form of a 100 stock dividend the stock split entitled all shareholders of record at the close of business on may 12 2008 to receive one additional share of our common stock par value 250 per share for each share of common stock held on that date 

  

share repurchase program – on january 30 2007 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 40 million shares of union pacific corporation common stock through the end of 2009 on may 1 2008 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 40 million common shares by march 31 2011 management’s assessments of market conditions and other pertinent facts guide the timing and volume of all repurchases we expect to fund our common stock repurchases through cash generated from operations the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties debt issuances and cash on hand at december 31 2008 

during 2008 we repurchased approximately 22 million shares under this program at an aggregate purchase price of approximately 15 billion in 2007 we repurchased approximately 25 million shares at an aggregate purchase price of approximately 15 billion these shares were recorded in treasury stock at cost which includes any applicable commissions and fees 

shelf registration statement and significant new borrowings – under our current shelf registration statement we may issue from time to time any combination of debt securities preferred stock common stock or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings in july 2008 our board of directors authorized the issuance of an additional 3 billion of debt securities under our shelf registration at december 31 2008 we had authority to issue up to 3 billion of debt securities 

during 2008 we issued the following unsecured fixedrate debt securities under our current shelf registration 

 

 the net proceeds from these offerings are for general corporate purposes including the repurchase of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program these debt securities include changeofcontrol provisions 

we have no immediate plans to issue equity securities however we will continue to explore opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under our shelf registration and therefore we may issue additional debt securities at any time 

on april 17 2008 we borrowed 100 million under a 5yearterm loan facility the loan the loan has a floating rate based on london interbank offered rates plus a spread and is prepayable in whole or in part without a premium prior to maturity the agreement documenting the loan has provisions similar to our revolving credit facility including identical debttonetworth covenant and changeofcontrol provisions and similar customary default provisions the agreement does not include any other financial restrictions credit rating triggers or any other provision that would require us to post collateral 

offbalance sheet arrangements contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and as referenced in the tables below we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments including material sources of offbalance sheet and structured finance arrangements other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the current and future condition of the capital markets as described in item 1a of part ii of this report there is no known trend demand commitment event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that 

  

would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition our commercial obligations financings and commitments are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations particularly within the transportation industry 

the following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of december 31 2008 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

offbalance sheet arrangements 

sale of receivables – the railroad transfers most of its accounts receivable to union pacific receivables inc upri a bankruptcyremote subsidiary as part of a sale of receivables facility upri sells without recourse on a 364day revolving basis an undivided interest in such accounts receivable to investors the total capacity to sell undivided interests to investors under the facility was 700 million and 600 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the facility was 584 million and 600 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively upri reduced the outstanding undivided interest held by investors due to a decrease in available receivables at december 31 2008 the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors is not included in our consolidated financial statements the value of the undivided interest held by investors was supported by 1015 million and 1071 million of accounts receivable held by upri at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively at december 31 2008 and 2007 the value of the interest retained by upri was 431 million and 471 million respectively this retained interest is included in accounts receivable in our consolidated financial statements the interest sold to investors is sold at carrying value which approximates fair value and there is no gain or loss recognized from the transaction 

the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors could fluctuate based upon the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks including default and dilution if default or dilution percentages were to increase one percentage point the amount of eligible receivables would decrease by 6 million should our credit rating fall below investment grade the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would be reduced and in certain cases the investors would have the right to discontinue the facility 

the railroad services the sold receivables however the railroad does not recognize any servicing asset or liability as the servicing fees adequately compensate us for these responsibilities the railroad collected approximately 178 billion and 161 billion during the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively upri used certain of these proceeds to purchase new receivables under the facility 

the costs of the sale of receivables program are included in other income and were 23 million 35 million and 33 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the costs include interest program fees paid to banks commercial paper issuing costs and fees for unused commitment availability 

the investors have no recourse to the railroad’s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims creditors of the railroad do not have recourse to the assets of upri in october 2008 we extended the sale of receivables program to august 2009 without any significant changes in terms except to increase the capacity to sell undivided interests to 660 million the capacity was increased to 700 million in december 2008 at january 16 2009 the amount utilized under the sale of receivables program was 560 million 

guarantees – at december 31 2008 we were contingently liable for 449 million in guarantees we have recorded a liability of 4 million and 5 million for the fair value of these obligations as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business and they include guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building equipment financings and affiliated operations the final guarantee expires in 2022 we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

other matters 

inflation – the cumulative effect of long periods of inflation significantly increases asset replacement costs for capitalintensive companies as a result assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels depreciation charges on an inflationadjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 

derivative financial instruments – we may use derivative financial instruments in limited instances to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and fuel prices we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged both at inception and throughout the hedged period we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items at inception as well as our riskmanagement objectives strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness changes in the fair market value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are charged to earnings we may use swaps collars futures andor forward contracts to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in interest rates and fuel prices however the use of these derivative financial instruments may limit future benefits from favorable price movements 

market and credit risk – we address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item we manage credit risk related to derivative financial instruments which is minimal by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements at december 31 2008 and 2007 we were not required to provide collateral nor had we received collateral relating to our hedging activities 

determination of fair value – we determine the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or the present value of expected future cash flows 

sensitivity analyses – the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 

at december 31 2008 we had variablerate debt representing approximately 5 of our total debt if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2009 than our december 31 2008 variable rate which was approximately 4 our interest expense would increase by approximately 4 million this amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balances of our variablerate debt at december 31 2008 

market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2008 and amounts to an increase of approximately 568 million to the fair value of our debt at december 31 2008 we estimated the fair values of our fixedrate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 

interest rate fair value hedges – we manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period we generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings we employ derivatives primarily swaps as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix in addition we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixedrate debt securities 

  

swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt’s fair value attributable to the changes in interest rates we account for swaps as fair value hedges using the shortcut method pursuant to fasb statement no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  therefore we do not record any ineffectiveness within our consolidated financial statements 

interest rate cash flow hedges – we report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affects earnings at both december 31 2008 and 2007 we had reductions of 4 million recorded as an accumulated other comprehensive loss that is being amortized on a straightline basis through september 30 2014 as of december 31 2008 and 2007 we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding 

accounting pronouncements – in march 2008 fasb issued statement no 161 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 133 fas 161 fas 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of fas 133 to clarify how and why companies use derivative instruments in addition fas 161 requires more disclosures regarding how companies account for derivative instruments and the impact derivatives have on a company’s financial statements this statement is effective for us beginning in 2009 and will only impact our disclosures it will have no impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in may 2008 the fasb issued statement no 162 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles fas 162 fas 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states fas 162 is effective 60 days following the sec’s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section 411 “ the meaning of ‘present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ’” fas 162 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 

in june 2008 the fasb released fsp eitf 0361 on emerging issues task force issue 036 participating securities and the twoclass method under fasb statement no 128 eitf 036 the staff position concludes that unvested sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities as defined in eitf 036 and therefore should be included in computing earnings per share using the twoclass method as discussed in note 3 we pay nonforfeitable dividends on our unvested retention awards and performance retention awards this staff position will be effective for us beginning in 2009 we expect that this staff position will result in additional disclosure only and not affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in december 2008 the fasb issued fsp fas 132r1 employers’ disclosure about postretirement benefit plan assets  which amends statement 132r to require more detailed disclosures about employers’ pension plan assets new disclosures will include more information on investment strategies major categories of plan assets concentrations of risk within plan assets and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets this new standard requires new disclosures only and will have no impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows these new disclosures will be required for us beginning in our 2009 form 10k 

asserted and unasserted claims – various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries we cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity however to the extent possible where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated we have recorded a liability we do not expect that any known lawsuits claims environmental costs commitments contingent liabilities or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our 

  

consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity after taking into account liabilities previously recorded for these matters 

indemnities – our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements including certain tax indemnifications can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions 

climate change – although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item 1a of this report we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact however we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment including investments in new technologies using training programs to reduce fuel consumption and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 1 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 these critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 

asbestos – we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other parties allege exposure to asbestos we engage a third party with extensive experience in estimating resolution costs for asbestosrelated claims to assist us in assessing our potential liability this liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing costs the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions 

 

  

  

  

   

our asbestosrelated liability activity was as follows 

 

 approximately 17 of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 83 related to unasserted claims at december 31 2008 these claims are expected to be paid out over the next 30 years in conjunction with the liability update performed in 2008 we also reassessed estimated insurance recoveries we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2008 and 2007 we will continue to review actual experience and adjust our estimate as warranted our asbestosrelated claims activity was as follows 

 

 we believe that our estimates of liability for asbestosrelated claims and insurance recoveries are reasonable and probable the amounts recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts however future events such as the number of new claims to be filed each year average settlement costs and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts estimates also may vary in the future if strategies activities and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change federal and state laws governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimants and there are material changes with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants 

environmental – we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations we identified 339 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements this includes 33 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government 18 of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 

  

our environmental liability activity was as follows 

 

 when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in our business we and our consultants perform environmental assessments on the property we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and we can reasonably estimate such costs we do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable 

the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties cost estimates are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and existing technology laws and regulations the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties sitespecific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal state and local laws governing environmental remediation as well as changes to the remediation plan for each site current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

personal injury – the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year we use thirdparty actuaries to assist us in measuring the expense and liability including unasserted claims the federal employers’ liability act fela governs compensation for workrelated accidents under fela damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or outofcourt settlements we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 

  

our personal injury liability is discounted to present value using applicable us treasury rates approximately 88 of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 12 related to unasserted claims at december 31 2008 estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation our personal injury liability activity was as follows 

 

 property and depreciation – our rail operations are highly capital intensive each year we develop a capital program for the acquisition or construction of fixed assets assets purchased or constructed throughout the year that were not part of the original program are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria which are approved by the stb properties are carried at cost and we follow the group method of depreciation our large base of homogeneous networktype assets turns over on a continuous basis the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources not as singular items under group depreciation all items with similar physical characteristics use and expected life are grouped together in a single asset class and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates the cost net of salvage of depreciable rail property retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized a gain or loss is recognized in other income for all other property upon disposition because the gain or loss is not part of rail operations 

we compute depreciation principally on the straightline method based on estimated service lives of depreciable property we use a unit of production convention to depreciate rail in highdensity traffic corridors we calculate service lives using companyspecific retirement data we perform and submit depreciation rate studies to the stb at least every three years for equipment and every six years for road property ie rail and other track material ties and ballast these rate studies are reviewed and approved by the stb these studies are used to develop our approved composite depreciation rates by asset class during 2008 we completed depreciation rate studies for both track and road property which will be used to calculate depreciation expense in 2009 and beyond 

when we purchase an asset we capitalize all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use however many of our assets are selfconstructed a large portion of our capital expenditures is for track structure expansion capacity projects and replacement program projects which is typically performed by our employees approximately 13 of our fulltime equivalent employees are dedicated to the construction of capital assets costs that are directly attributable or overhead costs that relate directly to 

  

capital projects are capitalized direct costs that are capitalized as part of selfconstructed assets include material labor and work equipment indirect costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset these costs are allocated using appropriate statistical bases the capitalization of indirect costs is consistent with fasb statement no 67 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects 

general and administrative expenditures are expensed as incurred normal repairs and maintenance are also expensed as incurred while costs incurred that extend the useful life of an asset improve the safety of our operations or improve operating efficiency are capitalized 

assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease amortization expense is computed using the straightline method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease 

significant capital spending in recent years increased the total value of our depreciable assets cash capital spending totaled 28 billion for the year ended december 31 2008 while depreciation expense totaled 14 billion we use various methods to estimate useful lives for each group of depreciable property variances to these estimates could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately 48 million if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were decreased by one year annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately 52 million 

income taxes – as required under fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes  we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns these expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated future tax law changes such as a change in the corporate tax rate could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations for example a 1 increase in the federal income tax rate would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately 260 million 

when appropriate we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized based on management’s judgments regarding the best available evidence about future events 

when we have claimed tax benefits that may be challenged by a tax authority these uncertain tax positions are accounted for under fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 we adopted fin 48 beginning january 1 2007 prior to 2007 income tax contingencies were accounted for under fasb statement no 5 accounting for contingencies  

under fin 48 we recognize tax benefits only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement a liability for “unrecognized tax benefits” is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards 

pension and other postretirement benefits – we use thirdparty actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and defined contribution medical and life insurance benefits opeb to eligible employees in order to use actuarial methods to value the 

  

liabilities and expenses we must make several assumptions the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets for opeb the critical assumptions are the discount rate and healthcare cost trend rate 

we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually and selected assumptions are based on the following factors 

 

  

  

 the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure pension and opeb expense for 2008 and the estimated impact on 2008 pension and opeb expense relative to a change in those assumptions

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

the management of union pacific corporation and subsidiary companies the corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f the corporation’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the corporation’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 

all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

the corporation’s management assessed the effectiveness of the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 in making this assessment it used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control – integrated framework based on our assessment management believes that as of december 31 2008 the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 

the corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting this report appears on page 90

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

union pacific corporation its directors and shareholders 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of union pacific corporation and subsidiary companies the corporation as of december 31 2008 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended december 31 2008 of the corporation and our report dated february 5 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the corporation’s adoption in 2006 of statement of financial accounting standards no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans

thirds of the chemicals business consists of liquid and dry chemicals plastics and liquid petroleum products in addition to transporting plastics customers also leverage our storageintransit yards for intermediate storage of plastic resins soda ash shipments originate in southwestern wyoming and california destined primarily for glass producing markets in the east the west and abroad fertilizer movements originate primarily in the gulf coast region as well as the west and canada bound for major agricultural users in the midwest and the western us 

energy – coal transportation accounted for 20 of our 2007 commodity revenue our geographic network allows us to transport coal destined for utilities and industrial facilities in 27 states as well as to the gulf and railbargeship facilities on the mississippi and ohio rivers and the great lakes we serve mines located in the southern powder river basin of wyoming sprb colorado utah southern wyoming and southern illinois sprb coal represents the largest growth segment of the market as utilities continue to favor its lower cost and lowsulfur content 

industrial products – our extensive network enables our industrial products group to move numerous commodities between thousands of origin and destination points throughout north america lumber shipments originate primarily in the pnw and canada for destinations throughout the united states for new home construction and repair and remodeling commercial and highway construction drives shipments of steel and construction products consisting of rock cement and roofing materials paper and consumer goods including furniture and appliances are shipped to major metropolitan areas for consumers nonferrous metals and industrial minerals are moved for industrial manufacturing in addition we provide efficient and safe transportation for government entities and waste companies in 2007 transporting industrial products provided 20 of our commodity revenue 

intermodal – our intermodal business which represented 19 of our 2007 commodity revenue includes international domestic and premium shipments international business consists of imported container traffic that arrives at west coast ports via steamship for destinations throughout the united states domestic business includes domestic container and trailer traffic for intermodal marketing companies primarily shipper agents and consolidators and truckload carriers lessthantruckload and package carriers with timesensitive business requirements account for the majority of our premium service 

seasonality – some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons reflecting either or both the nature of the commodity such as certain agricultural and food products that have specific growing and harvesting seasons and the demand cycle for the commodity such as intermodal traffic which generally has a peak shipping season during the third quarter to meet holidayrelated demand for consumer goods during the fourth quarter the peak shipping seasons for these commodities can vary considerably from year to year depending upon various factors including the strength of domestic and international economies and currencies and the strength of harvests and market prices of agricultural products in response to an annual request delivered by the surface transportation board stb to all of the class i railroads operating in the us we issue a letter during the third quarter detailing our plans for handling traffic during the third and fourth quarters and providing other information requested by the stb 

working capital – we currently have and historically have had a working capital deficit which is common in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity or financial stability we maintain adequate resources to meet our daily cash requirements and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

competition – we are subject to competition from other railroads motor carriers ship and barge operators and pipelines our main rail competitor is burlington northern santa fe corporation its rail subsidiary bnsf railway company bnsf operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors in addition we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers motor carrier competition is particularly strong for five of our six commodity groups excluding energy because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and gulf coast waterways barge competition can be particularly effective especially for grain and bulk commodities in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service while we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and 

  

barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation or legislation releasing motor carriers from their size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

equipment suppliers – we depend on two key domestic suppliers of locomotives due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of this equipment potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry with respect to this industry therefore if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives we could experience a significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations 

employees – approximately 86 of our 50089 fulltimeequivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions in january 2005 the us railroads began the current round of negotiations with the unions in june 2007 the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen the brotherhood of maintenance of way employees the brotherhood of railway signalmen the national conference of firemen and oilers the international brotherhood of boilermakers and blacksmiths and the sheet metal workers ratified a fiveyear agreement that provides for wage increases and increased employee health and welfare cost sharing the annual wage increases including retroactive increases are as follows july 2005 25 july 2006 30 july 2007 30 july 2008 40 july 2009 45 a second bargaining group consisting of the transportation communications international union the brotherhood of railway carman and the international brotherhood of electrical workers ratified the same agreement in september of 2007 however the international association of machinists iam failed to ratify this agreement in september we also settled with the american railway and airway supervisors association in september we reached a tentative agreement with the united transportation union in january of 2008 therefore we remain in negotiations with the iam and united supervisors council of america yardmasters existing agreements with these two unions continue in effect until new agreements are reached or the railway labor act’s procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential intervention are exhausted contract negotiations with the various unions generally take place over an extended period of time and we rarely experience work stoppages during negotiations the current agreements provide for periodic cost of living increases until new agreements are reached 

governmental and environmental regulation 

governmental regulation – our operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local regulations generally applicable to all businesses see also the discussion of certain regulatory proceedings in legal proceedings item 3 

the operations of the railroad are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the stb of the united states department of transportation dot the operations of the railroad are also subject to the regulations of the federal railroad administration of the dot and other federal and state agencies the stb has jurisdiction over rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic freight car compensation transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines and acquisition of control of rail common carriers on january 26 2007 the stb issued a decision limiting the manner in which us railroads can calculate fuel surcharges on traffic regulated by the stb and we have complied with this regulation the stb also has adopted new mechanisms for regulating some of our rates adopted a new methodology for calculating the cost of capital for railroads and expanded its review of line sales and leases various appeals may affect these regulations prior to final implementation

we are subject to significant governmental regulation – we are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal state and local authorities covering a variety of health safety labor environmental as discussed below and other matters many laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses permits and other authorizations and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us governments may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate without providing us any recourse to address any adverse effects on our business including without limitation regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution business relationships with other railroads calculation of our cost of capital or other inputs relevant to determining or estimating our revenue adequacy and costs and expenses increased regulation of the rail industry likely would restrict our ability to determine prices for certain rail services affect our ability to control traffic volume and reduce capital spending on our rail network facilities and equipment resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally one or more consolidations of class i railroads could lead to increased regulation of the rail industry 

we may be affected by general economic conditions – prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions affecting the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures – the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage environmental liability and other matters any material changes to litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving any or all of property damage personal injury and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are required to transport hazardous materials – federal laws require railroads including us to transport hazardous materials regardless of risk or potential exposure of loss any rail accident or other incident or accident on our network at our facilities or at the facilities of our customers involving the release of hazardous materials including toxic inhalation hazard or tih materials such as certain chlorine compounds could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury property damage and environmental penalties and remediation which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we must manage both significant demand for our services and network capacity – we may experience network difficulties including congestion and reduced velocity which may compromise the level of service we 

  

provide to our customers this level of demand may compound the impact of weather and weatherrelated events on our operations and velocity although we continue to improve our transportation plan add capacity and improve operations at our yards and other facilities we cannot be sure that these measures will fully or adequately address any service shortcomings we may experience other difficulties related to network capacity dramatic and unplanned increases or decreases of demand for rail service with respect to one or more of our commodity groups or other events that could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures – severe weather conditions events and other natural phenomena including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods mudslides or landslides extreme temperatures and significant precipitation may cause business interruptions including line outages on our rail network that can adversely affect our entire rail network and result in increased costs increased liabilities and decreased revenue which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations as the majority of our employees belong to labor unions and labor agreements – we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in among other things strikes work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers if unionized workers were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown or other employees were to become unionized we could experience a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could compromise our service reliability and significantly increase our costs for healthcare wages and other benefits which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

the availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations – changes in demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to meet demand for rail service unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations – we rely on information technology in all aspects of our business if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if we are unable to implement new technology we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally if we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment we could experience a service interruption safety failure security breach or other operational difficulties which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to significant environmental laws and regulations – our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waters handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and hazardous material or petroleum releases we generate and transport hazardous and nonhazardous waste in our operations and we did so in our former operations environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties leased properties and properties owned by third parties as well as to properties we currently own environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation we have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated or are strictly liable under these laws or regulations we could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate 

  

and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we may be affected by climate change and market or regulatory responses to climate change – climate change including the impact of global warming could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gasses including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating costs restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that a use commodities that we carry to produce energy b use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry or c manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels including chemical producers farmers and food producers and automakers and other manufacturers significant cost increases government regulation or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns including for example the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers finally we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change any of these factors individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

rising or elevated fuel costs and whether we are able to mitigate these costs with fuel surcharges could materially and adversely affect our business – fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses diesel fuel prices are subject to dramatic fluctuations and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results although we currently are able to recover a significant amount of our increased fuel expenses through revenue from fuel surcharges we cannot be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elevated fuel costs through surcharges future market conditions or legislative or regulatory activities could adversely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharges or adequately recover increased fuel costs through fuel surcharges international political and economic circumstances affect fuel prices and supplies weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity if a fuel supply shortage were to arise higher fuel prices could despite our fuel surcharge programs have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we face competition from other railroads and other transportation providers – we face competition from other railroads motor carriers ships barges and pipelines in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service while we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation or legislation releasing motor carriers from their size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect the competitive environment in which we operate 

we are subject to legislative regulatory and legal developments involving taxes – taxes are a significant part of our expenses we are subject to federal and state income payroll property sales and use fuel and other types of taxes any or all changes in tax rates enactment of new tax laws revisions of tax regulations and claims or litigation with taxing authorities could result in substantially higher taxes and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we utilize capital markets – we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements including the issuance of longterm debt instruments and commercial paper from time to time as well as the sale of certain of our receivables significant instability of the capital markets or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to commercial paper and 

  

other financing sources and reduce our credit ratings below investment grade which would prohibit us from utilizing our sale of receivables program and significantly increase the costs associated with issuing both commercial paper and longterm debt 

we are dependent on two key domestic suppliers of locomotives – due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry with respect to this industry therefore if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives we could experience a significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations 

we may be affected by acts of terrorism war or risk of war – our rail lines facilities and equipment including rail cars carrying hazardous materials could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks terrorist attacks or other similar events any government response thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in addition insurance premiums for some or all of our current coverages could increase dramatically or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future

 item 2 properties 

we employ a variety of assets in the management and operation of our rail business our rail network links 23 states in the western twothirds of the us 

  

track – our rail network includes 32205 route miles we own 26354 miles and operate on the remainder pursuant to trackage rights or leases the following table describes track miles at december 31 2007 and 2006 

 

 harriman dispatching center – the harriman dispatching center hdc located in omaha nebraska is our primary dispatching facility it is linked to regional dispatching and locomotive management facilities at various locations along our network the hdc moves locomotives and trains manages traffic on our network and coordinates interchanges with other railroads over 700 employees currently work onsite in the facility 

rail facilities – in addition to our track structure we operate numerous facilities including terminals for intermodal and other freight rail yards for trainbuilding switching storageintransit the temporary storage of customer goods in rail cars prior to shipment and other activities offices to administer and manage our operations dispatch centers to direct traffic on our rail network crew quarters to house train crews along our network and shops and other facilities for fueling maintenance and repair of locomotives and repair and maintenance of rail cars and other equipment the following tables include the major yards and terminals on our system 

 

   

 rail equipment – our equipment includes owned and leased locomotives and rail cars heavy maintenance equipment and machinery other equipment and tools in our shops offices and facilities and vehicles for maintenance transportation of crews and other activities as of december 31 2007 we owned or leased the following units of equipment 

 

  

 capital expenditures – our rail network requires significant annual capital investments for maintenance improvement and expansion these investments maintain and enhance safe operations support the transportation needs of our customers and improve our operational efficiency additionally we add new locomotives and freight cars to our fleet to replace older less efficient equipment to support growth and customer demand and to reduce our impact on the environment through the acquisition of more fuel efficient and low emission locomotives including yard engines that use new hybrid technology 

2007 capital expenditures – during 2007 we made capital investments totaling 31 billion which included cash spending of 25 billion see the capital expenditures table in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources – financial condition item 7 we also acquired 259 locomotives and 150 freight cars under longterm operating leases with an aggregate net present value of 434 million we procured an additional 56 locomotives and other equipment through capital lease financings valued at 82 million 

  

sunset corridor expansion – one of our critical routes is the sunset corridor a 760mile route running between los angeles and el paso texas this heavily traveled corridor carries about 20 percent of our traffic including a significant amount of intermodal traffic in 2007 we added 33 miles of double track to the corridor which now includes nearly 410 miles of double track approximately 54 of the route 

sprb jointline expansion – an important part of our franchise is our access to the coalproducing sprb through a joint line which we own with bnsf the joint line in addition to the significant annual maintenance required on the joint line due to the volume of trains the weight of loaded coal cars and the impact of coal dust on rail beds a capacity expansion project is underway during 2007 we completed the installation of additional main line track so the entire joint line now has triple track 

2008 capital expenditures – in 2008 we expect to make capital investments of approximately 31 billion which may be revised if revenue tax and business conditions require changing or new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments see discussion of our 2008 capital plan in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – 2008 outlook item 7 

equipment encumbrance – equipment with a carrying value of approximately 28 billion at both december 31 2007 and 2006 serves as collateral for capital leases and other types of equipment obligations in accordance with the secured financing arrangements utilized to acquire such railroad equipment 

as a result of the merger of missouri pacific railroad company mprr with and into uprr on january 1 1997 and pursuant to the underlying indentures for the mprr mortgage bonds uprr must maintain the same value of assets after the merger in order to comply with the security requirements of the mortgage bonds as of the merger date the value of the mprr assets that secured the mortgage bonds was approximately 60 billion in accordance with the terms of the indentures this collateral value must be maintained during the entire term of the mortgage bonds irrespective of the outstanding balance of such bonds 

certain of our properties are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment see discussion of environmental issues in business – governmental and environmental regulation item 1 and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies – environmental item 7 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation that occur in connection with our business management routinely assesses our liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest available information consistent with sec rules and requirements we describe below material pending legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities other proceedings arising under federal state or local environmental laws and regulations including governmental proceedings involving potential fines penalties or other monetary sanctions in excess of 100000 and such other pending matters that we may determine to be appropriate 

environmental matters 

as we reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2007 the railroad received notice from the army corps of engineers the corps that during its construction efforts to restore service to the caliente subdivision after severe flooding in january 2005 the railroad may have exceeded its authority under emergency authorizations and permits issued by the corps subsequently the corps referred the matter to the epa which has demanded that the railroad repair claimed impacts to the adjacent waterway perform compensatory mitigation and pay a civil penalty in connection with this project and related storm water issues the railroad and the epa have discussed the scope of additional work to be performed by the railroad to address alleged impacts of its construction activities as well as compensatory 

  

mitigation and potential penalties to date we have not reached an agreement with the epa and therefore the ultimate amount of the civil penalty cannot be determined however the penalty component of the settlement will exceed 100000 

as we reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2004 the illinois attorney general’s office filed an agreed order and complaint and a complaint for injunctive and other relief on october 7 2004 in the circuit court for the twentieth judicial circuit st clair county against the alton  southern railway company a whollyowned subsidiary of the railroad as a result of a collision and derailment on september 21 2004 the state of illinois seeks to enjoin the alton  southern railway company from further violations as well as a monetary penalty the railroad reached a tentative agreement with the state of illinois that will require the payment of a penalty in the amount of 48000 the agreement should be executed in the first quarter of 2008 

as we reported in our annual report on form 10k for 2005 the epa considers the railroad a potentially responsible party for the omaha lead site the omaha lead site consists of approximately 12800 acres of residential property in the eastern part of omaha nebraska allegedly impacted by air emissions from two former lead smeltersrefineries one refinery was operated by asarco the epa identified the railroad as a potentially responsible party because more than 60 years ago the railroad owned land that was leased to asarco the railroad disputes both the legal and technical basis of the epa’s allegations it has nonetheless engaged in extensive negotiations with the epa these negotiations reached an apparent impasse the epa issued a unilateral administrative order with an effective date of december 16 2005 directing the railroad to implement an interim remedy at the site at an estimated cost of 50 million failure to comply with the order without just cause could subject the railroad to penalties of up to 32500 per day and triple the epa’s costs in performing the work the railroad believes it has just cause not to comply with the order but it offered to perform some of the work specified in the order as a compromise to date the epa has rejected all of the railroad’s offers to settle or resolve this matter the railroad will vigorously contest liability and the imposition of any penalties 

as we reported in our annual report on form 10k for 2005 the illinois attorney general’s office filed a complaint in the circuit court for the twentyfirst judicial circuit st clair county seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties against the railroad relating to a collision between uprr and norfolk southern railway company ns trains near momence illinois on november 24 2005 the collision derailed approximately five locomotives and 30 railcars two of the uprr locomotives and two of the ns locomotives caught fire and four of the locomotives released approximately 16000 gallons of diesel fuel other cars carrying food products derailed and released an unknown amount of product the state of illinois seeks a permanent injunction against the railroad ordering uprr to continue remediation the state of illinois seeks to enjoin uprr from further violations and payment of a monetary penalty union pacific reached a tentative agreement with the state of illinois that will require payment of 60000 which includes a penalty payment and the amount of the state’s response costs the agreement should be executed in the first quarter of 2008 

as we reported in our annual report on form 10k for 2005 the illinois attorney general’s office filed a complaint in the circuit court for the twentieth judicial circuit st clair county for injunctive and other relief on november 28 2005 against the railroad alleging a diesel fuel spill from an aboveground storage tank in a rail yard in dupo st clair county illinois the state of illinois seeks to enjoin uprr from further violations and a monetary penalty the amount of the proposed penalty is uncertain 

as we reported in our annual report on form 10k for 2003 the united states attorney for the central district of california notified the railroad that the office intended to pursue criminal charges against the railroad for alleged violations of federal environmental laws including the federal clean water act in connection with releases of oil contaminated wastewater from our taylor yard in 2001 and 2003 on july 31 2006 the united states attorney filed criminal misdemeanor charges against us for these releases in the united states district court for the central district of california and we received the summons from the court on august 8 2006 we will vigorously defend the charges 

  

we received notices from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are or may be liable under federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the united states including sites on the superfund national priorities list or state superfund lists we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings and suits because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs 

information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies – environmental item 7 

other matters 

as we reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2007 20 small rail shippers many of whom are represented by the same law firms filed virtually identical antitrust lawsuits in various federal district courts against us and four other class i railroads in the us the original plaintiff filed the first of these claims in the us district court in new jersey on may 14 2007 and the additional plaintiffs filed claims in district courts in various states including florida illinois alabama pennsylvania and the district of columbia these suits allege that the railroads engaged in pricefixing by establishing common fuel surcharges for certain rail traffic 

we received additional complaints during the third and fourth quarters of 2007 increasing the total number of complaints to 30 a few of these suits involve plaintiffs alleging that they are or were indirect purchasers of rail transportation and seeking to represent the class of indirect purchasers of rail transportation that paid fuel surcharges these complaints have added allegations under state antitrust and consumer protection laws all of these “copycat” lawsuits whether filed by direct or indirect purchasers of rail transportation are being filed by various groups of plaintiffs’ lawyers seeking to become lead counsel in a nationwide class action against the railroads each of the plaintiffs requests certification of its complaint as a classaction on november 6 2007 the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation ordered that all of the rail fuel surcharge cases be transferred to the us district court in dc for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings 

additionally the attorney general of a state outside our service area issued a grand jury subpoena to us requesting documents pertaining to our fuel surcharge program we met with representatives of this attorney general’s office and we plan to have additional meetings in the future in an effort to resolve that office’s interest in this matter 

we deny the allegations that our fuel surcharge program violates the antitrust laws or any other laws we believe that these lawsuits are without merit and we will vigorously defend our actions therefore we currently believe that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on any of our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

operating revenue 

 

 operating revenue includes commodity revenue and other revenue the primary drivers of commodity revenue are volume carloads and average revenue per car arc arc varies with changes in price commodity mix and fuel surcharges other revenue consists primarily of revenue earned by our subsidiaries revenue from our commuter rail operations and accessorial revenue which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us or when we perform additional services such as switching or storage 

we recognize commodity revenue on a percentageofcompletion basis as freight moves from origin to destination we allocate revenue between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them we recognize other revenue as service is performed or contractual obligations are met we provide incentives to our customers for meeting or exceeding specified cumulative volumes or shipping to and from specific locations which we record as a reduction to revenue based on the actual or projected future shipments 

revenue from five of our six commodity groups increased during 2007 while revenue generated from industrial products shipments declined arc increased 6 during 2007 driven by core price improvement lower shipments of industrial and agricultural products drove volume down 1 in 2007 more than offsetting an increase in chemical shipments our fuel surcharge programs excluding indexbased contract escalators that contain some provision for fuel generated 15 billion in commodity revenue in 2007 fuel surcharge revenue is not comparable to prior periods due to implementation of new mileagebased fuel surcharge programs for certain traffic as previously disclosed in our 2006 annual report on form 10k the stb issued a decision limiting the manner in which us railroads can calculate fuel surcharges on traffic regulated by the 

  

stb effective april 26 2007 we implemented new fuel surcharge programs covering this regulated traffic which represents approximately 19 of our current revenue base these new programs use mileage as opposed to percent of revenue as the basis for calculating fuel surcharges and they use the onhighway diesel price index – published by the energy information administration – for purposes of determining fuel costs the new programs affect fuel surcharges assessed for certain shipments of agricultural chemical and industrial products and to a lesser extent coal in addition we reset the effective base fuel price at which our new mileagebased fuel surcharge programs take effect resulting in a higher starting point of 230 per gallon versus 135 per gallon 

all six commodity groups produced doubledigit revenue growth in 2006 including over 20 growth of revenue from agricultural commodities price increases fuel surcharges and indexbased contract escalators which are formulas in our shipping contracts that correlate price adjustments to certain economic indices all contributed to higher arc our fuel surcharge programs excluding indexbased contract escalators that contain some provision for fuel generated an additional 656 million in commodity revenue compared to 2005 contributing 5 to commodity revenue growth volume increased 3 during the year led by solid growth of intermodal and energy shipments which were partially offset by lower shipments of industrial products and chemicals lower volume in 2005 due to the january west coast storm sprb joint line disruptions hurricane rita and the kansas washouts also contributed to this yearoveryear growth 

the following tables summarize the yearoveryear changes in commodity revenue revenue carloads and arc by commodity type 

 

   

  

   

  

   

  

   

operating expenses 

 

  

   

costs in 2007 compared to 206 per gallon in 2006 increased expenses by 242 million a 2 improvement of our fuel consumption rate resulting from the use of newer more fuelefficient locomotives and our fuel conservation programs reduced fuel expense by 43 million and a 2 decrease of gross ton miles reduced fuel expense by an additional 53 million 

higher diesel fuel prices which averaged 206 per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in 2006 compared to 177 per gallon in 2005 increased expenses by 393 million during 2006 a 3 increase in gross tonmiles resulted in 63 million of additional expenses which was partially offset by a 2 improvement in our fuel consumption rate due to the use of newer more fuelefficient locomotives and our fuel conservation programs as noted above and described in this item 7 we offset a significant portion of increased locomotive fuel expenses through revenue from fuel surcharges gasoline utilities and propane and other fuel expenses increased 20 million in 2006 due to higher prices and increased usage 

equipment and other rents – equipment and other rents includes primarily rental expense we pay for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies freight car intermodal and locomotive leases other specialty equipment leases and office and other rentals fewer shipments of industrial products combined with improved carcycle times which reflect operational improvement and better asset utilization reduced our shortterm freight car rental expense by 46 million in 2007 compared to 2006 lower lease expenses for freight cars intermodal containers and fleet vehicles and equipment decreased costs by 20 million in 2007 conversely higher locomotive lease expense resulted in a 33 million increase in costs during the year 

lease expense increased in 2006 compared to 2005 as we leased more locomotives and freight cars growth in automotive and intermodal shipments also increased our shortterm freight car rental expense improved carcycle times driven by network management initiatives partially offset this increase 

depreciation – the majority of depreciation relates to track structure including rail ties and other track material a higher depreciable asset base reflecting higher capital spending in recent years increased depreciation expense in 2007 and 2006 

materials and supplies – materials used to maintain our lines structures and equipment are the principal components of materials and supplies expense this expense item also includes small tools office supplies other materials and the costs of freight services to ship supplies and materials increased use of higher cost components to repair and maintain our fleet of locomotives including a growing number of units not covered by warranties added 32 million to materials and supplies expense during 2007 conversely we used fewer parts for freight car repairs due to program maintenance scheduling which lowered costs by 11 million and partially offset the increase for 2007 

we used more repair materials at higher component costs to repair and maintain freight cars and locomotives in 2006 including a growing number of units not covered by warranties in addition we performed more maintenance on locomotives that were maintained internally and not subject to maintenance contracts with thirdparty contractors compared to 2005 

casualty costs – personal injury costs freight and property damage insurance and environmental expense are the primary components of casualty costs casualty costs were lower in 2007 compared to 2006 driven primarily by a reduction in personal injury expense actuarial studies completed during 2007 resulted in a reduction in personal injury expense of approximately 80 million which was partially offset by an adverse development with respect to one claim 

costs were flat in 2006 compared to 2005 as lower bad debt expenses lower freight damage expenses and lower expenses for destruction of foreign or leased equipment all offset increased personal injury costs and higher settlement expenses 

purchased services and other costs – purchased services and other costs include expenses associated with outside contractors state and local taxes net costs of operating facilities jointly used with other railroads 

  

transportation and lodging for train crew employees trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers leased automobile maintenance expenses telephone and cellular expense employee travel expense and computer and other general expenses higher consulting fees and higher contract expenses including equipment maintenance increased costs by 58 million in addition crew transportation and lodging costs increased 17 million in 2007 due to higher gas prices and rate inflation conversely lower drayage expense of 13 million settlement of insurance claims in 2007 related to hurricane rita and higher equity income partially offset these increases in addition the yearoveryear comparison was affected by the settlement of insurance claims totaling 23 million in 2006 related to the january 2005 west coast storm and a 9 million gain in 2006 from the sale of two companyowned airplanes 

volumerelated expenses including crew transportation and lodging costs increased in 2006 driven by 3 growth in carloads higher state and local taxes primarily sales and use taxes related to higher diesel fuel prices also increased expenses in 2006 compared to 2005 conversely lower locomotive contract maintenance costs and lower expenses associated with jointlyowned operating facilities reduced expenses in 2006 compared to 2005 settlement of all remaining insurance claims related to the january 2005 west coast storm and the gain from the sale of two airplanes also reduced expenses in 2006 finally cleanup and restoration costs related to the january west coast storm increased expenses in 2005 

nonoperating items 

 

 other income – lower net gains from nonoperating asset sales primarily real estate drove the reduction in other income in 2007 recognition of rental income in 2006 from the settlement of a rent dispute also contributed to the yearoveryear decrease in other income cash investment returns increased 21 million due to larger cash balances and higher interest rates 

lower net gains from nonoperating asset sales primarily real estate and higher expenses due to rising interest rates associated with our sale of receivables program resulted in a reduction in other income in 2006 which was partially offset by higher rental income for the use of our rightofway including 2006 settlements of rate disputes from prior years and cash investment returns due to higher interest rates 

interest expense – higher interest expense in 2007 was driven by an increase in the weightedaverage debt levels of 73 billion compared to 71 billion in 2006 a lower effective interest rate of 66 in 2007 compared to 67 in 2006 partially offset the effects of the higher debt level 

lower interest expense in 2006 was due to a decline in the weightedaverage debt level from 78 billion in 2005 to 71 billion in 2006 a higher effective interest rate of 67 in 2006 compared to 65 in 2005 partially offset the effects of the declining debt level 

income taxes – income taxes were 235 million higher in 2007 due primarily to higher pretax income and the effect of new tax legislation in the state of illinois that changed how we determine the amount of our income subject to illinois tax the illinois legislation increased our deferred tax expense by 27 million in 2007 our effective tax rates were 384 and 364 in 2007 and 2006 respectively 

income tax expense was 509 million higher in 2006 than 2005 higher pretax income resulted in additional taxes of 414 million and 118 million of the increase resulted from a reduction of deferred tax expense in 2005 final settlements of pre1995 tax years and internal revenue service examination reports for 1995 

  

through 2002 among other things resulted in the 118 million reduction in 2005 our effective tax rate was 364 and 286 in 2006 and 2005 respectively 

other operatingperformance and financial statistics 

we report key railroad performance measures weekly to the association of american railroads aar including carloads average daily inventory of rail cars on our system average train speed and average terminal dwell time we provide this data on our website at wwwupcominvestorsreportsindexshtml 

operatingperformance statistics 

railroad performance measures reported to the aar as well as other performance measures are included in the table below 

 

 average train speed – average train speed is calculated by dividing train miles by hours operated on our main lines between terminals ongoing network management initiatives and capacity expansion contributed to 2 and 1 improvements of average train speed during 2007 and 2006 respectively 

average terminal dwell time – average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our terminals lower average terminal dwell time is favorable average terminal dwell improved 8 and 5 in 2007 and 2006 respectively as a result of ongoing management initiatives and directed efforts to more timely deliver rail cars to our interchange partners and customers average terminal dwell time was also impacted by 1 lower volume levels in 2007 and a 3 increase in volume levels during 2006 

gross and revenue tonmiles – gross tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded or empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled revenue tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles revenue tonmiles declined 1 in relation to the 1 reduction in carloadings in 2007 compared to 2006 gross tonmiles decreased 2 in 2007 driven by a mix shift in freight shipments in 2006 gross and revenueton miles grew 3 in relation to the 3 increase in carloadings as volume was balanced between the higher and lower density commodities 

operating ratio – operating ratio is defined as our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue our operating ratio improved 22 points to 793 in 2007 as a result of yield increases network management initiatives and improved productivity in 2006 our operating ratio improved 53 points to 815 as a result of solid demand yield increases and improved operational efficiency 

average fulltimeequivalent employees – lower employee levels in 2007 versus 2006 resulted from fewer train and engine personnel due to improved network productivity and 1 lower volume levels partially offset by more employees maintaining our larger locomotive fleet the larger fulltimeequivalent number in 2006 included more people to maintain our larger locomotive and freight car fleet more employees needed for increased track repair and maintenance programs more operations management personnel including an expanded management training program and more train and engine personnel to meet demand levels 

  

customer satisfaction index – the customer satisfaction survey asks customers to rate how satisfied they are with our performance over the last 12 months on a variety of attributes a higher score indicates higher customer satisfaction the improvement in survey results in 2007 and 2006 generally reflects customer recognition of our improving service 

return on average common shareholders’ equity 

 

 return on invested capital as adjusted roic 

 

 roic is considered a nongaap financial measure by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk we believe this measure is important in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the corporation’s longterm capital investments and we currently use roic as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of equity compensation for our executives roic should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for other information provided in accordance with gaap a comparable gaap measure is return on average common shareholders’ equity the tables above provide a reconciliation from return on average common shareholders’ equity to roic 

  

debt to capital  adjusted debt to capital 

 

  

 adjusted debt to capital is a nongaap financial measure under sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk we believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the total amount of leverage in our capital structure including offbalance sheet lease obligations which we generally incur in connection with financing the acquisition of locomotives and freight cars and certain facilities we monitor the ratio of adjusted debt to capital as we manage our capital structure to balance costeffective and efficient access to the capital markets with the corporation’s overall cost of capital adjusted debt to capital should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for debt to capital the tables above provide a reconciliation from debt to capital to adjusted debt to capital our december 31 2007 debt to capital ratios increased as a result of a 902 million increase in debt from december 31 2006 and purchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program partially offset by an increase in retained earnings due to higher earnings in 2007 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2007 our principal sources of liquidity included cash cash equivalents the sale of certain receivables an uncommitted line of credit and our revolving credit facility as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets we had 19 billion of committed credit available under our credit facility with no borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2007 we did not make any shortterm borrowings under this facility during the year we also had a 75 million uncommitted line of credit available which was not used during the year the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the sale of receivables program was 600 million as of december 31 2007 the sale of receivables program is subject to certain requirements including maintenance of an investment grade bond rating if our bond rating were to deteriorate it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financings is dependent on market conditions deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to utilize commercial paper as a source of liquidity liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability 

at december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 we had working capital deficits of approximately 04 billion and 11 billion respectively a working capital deficit is common in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity we maintain adequate resources to meet our daily cash requirements and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

  

financial condition 

 

 cash provided by operating activities – we generated higher income in 2007 which was the primary driver of the increase of cash provided by operating activities pension contributions in 2006 totaling 150 million also contributed to the yearoveryear increase these increases were partially offset by cash payments representing prior period wage increases in accordance with recent union contract ratifications and higher income tax payments 

higher income in 2006 generated the increased cash provided by operating activities which was partially offset by higher income tax payments 150 million in voluntary pension contributions higher material and supply inventories and higher management incentive payments 

cash used in investing activities – higher capital investments and work in process balances drove the increase in cash used in investing in 2007 the third quarter of 2006 included insurance settlement proceeds for property damages resulting from the 2005 west coast storm 

an insurance settlement for the january 2005 west coast storm and lower balances for work in process decreased the amount of cash used in investing activities in 2006 higher capital investments and lower proceeds from asset sales partially offset this decrease 

cash used in financing activities – the increase in cash used in financing activities resulted primarily from the use of 14 billion to repurchase common shares payment of higher dividends and lower net proceeds from equity compensation plans 71 million in 2007 compared to 160 million in 2006 these increases were mostly offset by debt issuances of 16 billion in 2007 compared to no issuances in 2006 the increase in cash used in financing activities in 2006 resulted primarily from lower net proceeds from equity compensation plans 160 million in 2006 compared to 262 million in 2005 

the table below details cash capital investments for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

 in 2008 we expect our total capital investments to be approximately 31 billion which may be revised if revenue tax or business conditions require changing or new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments major investment categories include 16 billion to maintain and improve track infrastructure 840 million to increase network and terminal capacity 490 million to upgrade our locomotive and freight car fleet including the acquisition of 175 highhorsepower locomotives and new covered hoppers and 170 million primarily to upgrade information technology systems including the testing of positive train control and other capital projects we expect to fund our 2008 cash capital investments 

  

through cash generated from operations the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties debt issuances and cash on hand at december 31 2007 our annual capital plan is a critical component of our longterm strategic plan which we designed to enhance the longterm value of the corporation for our shareholders by providing sufficient resources to i maintain and improve our existing track infrastructure to provide safe and fluid operations ii increase network efficiency by adding or improving facilities and track and iii make investments that meet customer demand and take advantage of opportunities for longterm growth 

for each of the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 51 44 and 29 respectively the increases in 2007 and 2006 were driven by higher net income the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis earnings represent income from continuing operations less equity earnings net of distributions plus fixed charges and income taxes fixed charges represent interest charges amortization of debt discount and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges see exhibit 12 for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

financing activities 

credit facilities – on december 31 2007 19 billion of credit was available under our revolving credit facility the facility which we entered into on april 20 2007 the facility is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper we did not draw on the facility during 2007 commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investmentgrade borrowers the facility allows for borrowings at floating rates based on london interbank offered rates plus a spread depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings the facility requires the maintenance of a debt to net worth coverage ratio at december 31 2007 we were in compliance with this covenant the facility does not include any other financial restrictions credit rating triggers other than ratingdependent pricing or any other provision that could require us to post collateral the facility which expires in april 2012 replaced two 1 billion 5year facilities with terms ending in march 2009 and march 2010 the facility includes terms that are comparable with those of the prior facilities although the minimum net worth requirement of 75 billion in prior facilities was removed and the facility includes a changeofcontrol provision 

in addition to our revolving credit facility a 75 million uncommitted line of credit was available the line of credit expires in april 2008 and was not used in 2007 we must have equivalent credit available under our fiveyear facility to draw on this 75 million line 

at december 31 2007 we reclassified as longterm debt approximately 550 million of debt due within one year that we intend to refinance this reclassification reflected our ability and intent to refinance any shortterm borrowings and certain current maturities of longterm debt on a longterm basis at december 31 2006 we did not reclassify any shortterm debt as longterm debt as we did not intend to refinance at that time 

dividends – on november 15 2007 we increased the quarterly dividend to 044 per share payable beginning on january 2 2008 to shareholders of record on november 29 2007 we expect to fund the increase in the quarterly dividend through cash generated from operations the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties and cash on hand at december 31 2007 

dividend restrictions – our revolving credit facility includes a debttonet worth covenant that under certain circumstances restricts the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders the amount of retained earnings available for dividends was 115 billion and 78 billion at december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively this facility replaced two credit facilities that had minimum net worth covenants that were more restrictive with respect to the amount of retained earnings available for dividends at december 31 2006 

share repurchase program – on january 30 2007 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20 million shares of union pacific corporation common stock through the end of 2009 management’s 

  

assessments of market conditions and other pertinent facts guide the timing and volume of all repurchases we expect to fund our common stock repurchases through cash generated from operations the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties debt issuances and cash on hand at december 31 2007 

during 2007 we repurchased approximately 13 million shares under this program at an aggregate purchase price of approximately 15 billion these shares were recorded in treasury stock at cost which includes any applicable commissions and fees 

shelf registration statement and significant new borrowings – our board of directors authorized the issuance of up to 3 billion of debt securities pursuant to a new shelf registration statement which became effective on march 6 2007 replacing the 500 million of authority remaining under our shelf registration filed in december 2003 under the current shelf registration we may issue from time to time any combination of debt securities preferred stock common stock or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings 

we have issued the following unsecured fixedrate debt securities under our current shelf registration 

 

 the net proceeds from these offerings are for general corporate purposes including the repurchase of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program these debt securities include changeofcontrol provisions we have no immediate plans to issue equity securities however we will continue to explore opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under our shelf registration and therefore we may issue additional debt securities at any time 

operating lease activities 

during 2007 the railroad as lessee entered into longterm operating lease arrangements covering 259 locomotives and 150 rail cars with a total equipment cost of approximately 538 million in total these new lease arrangements will provide for minimum rental payments of approximately 831 million with a present value of approximately 434 million 

the lessors financed the purchase of the locomotives and freight cars in part by issuing equipment notes that are nonrecourse to the railroad and are secured by assignments of the underlying leases and security interests in the equipment the corporation and the railroad do not guaranty payment of the equipment notes the railroad’s obligations to make operating lease payments under the leases are recourse obligations and are not recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position 

the railroad has certain renewal and purchase options with respect to the locomotives and freight cars if the railroad does not exercise these options the equipment will be returned to the lessors at the end of the lease term 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and as referenced in the tables below we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition however based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments including material sources of offbalance sheet and structured finance arrangements there is no known trend demand commitment event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition our commercial obligations financings and commitments are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations particularly within the transportation industry 

the following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of december 31 2007 

 

  

      

  

      

offbalance sheet arrangements 

sale of receivables – the railroad transfers most of its accounts receivable to union pacific receivables inc upri a bankruptcyremote subsidiary as part of a sale of receivables facility upri sells without recourse on a 364day revolving basis an undivided interest in such accounts receivable to investors the total capacity to sell undivided interests to investors under the facility was 600 million at both december 31 2007 and 2006 the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the facility was 600 million at both december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors is not included in our consolidated financial statements the value of the undivided interest held by investors was supported by 1071 million and 1158 million of accounts receivable held by upri at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively at december 31 2007 and 2006 the value of the interest retained by upri was 471 million and 558 million respectively this retained interest is included in accounts receivable in our consolidated financial statements the interest sold to investors is sold at carrying value which approximates fair value and there is no gain or loss recognized from the transaction 

the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors could fluctuate based upon the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks including default and dilution if default or dilution percentages were to increase one percentage point the amount of eligible receivables would decrease by 6 million should our credit rating fall below investment grade the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would be reduced and in certain cases the investors would have the right to discontinue the facility 

the railroad services the sold receivables however the railroad does not recognize any servicing asset or liability as the servicing fees adequately compensate us for these responsibilities the railroad collected approximately 161 billion and 155 billion during the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively upri used certain of these proceeds to purchase new receivables under the facility 

the costs of the sale of receivables program are included in other income and were 35 million 33 million and 23 million for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the costs include interest program fees paid to banks commercial paper issuing costs and fees for unused commitment availability 

the investors have no recourse to the railroad’s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims creditors of the railroad do not have recourse to the assets of upri in august 2007 the sale of receivables program was renewed for an additional 364day period without any significant changes in terms 

guarantees – at december 31 2007 we were contingently liable for 465 million in guarantees we have recorded a liability of 5 million and 6 million for the fair value of these obligations as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business and they include guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building equipment financings and affiliated operations the final guarantee expires in 2022 we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

other matters 

inflation – the cumulative effect of long periods of inflation significantly increases asset replacement costs for capitalintensive companies as a result assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels depreciation charges on an inflationadjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 

derivative financial instruments – we may use derivative financial instruments in limited instances for other than trading purposes to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and fuel prices we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a 

  

specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged both at inception and throughout the hedged period we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items at inception as well as our riskmanagement objectives strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness changes in the fair market value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are charged to earnings we may use swaps collars futures andor forward contracts to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in interest rates and fuel prices however the use of these derivative financial instruments may limit future benefits from favorable price movements 

market and credit risk – we address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item we manage credit risk related to derivative financial instruments which is minimal by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements at december 31 2007 and 2006 we were not required to provide collateral nor had we received collateral relating to our hedging activities 

determination of fair value – we determine the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or the present value of expected future cash flows 

sensitivity analyses – the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 

at december 31 2007 we had variablerate debt representing approximately 3 of our total debt if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2008 than our december 31 2007 variable rate which was approximately 7 our interest expense would increase by approximately 3 million this amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balances of our variablerate debt at december 31 2007 

market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2007 and amounts to an increase of approximately 524 million to the fair value of our debt at december 31 2007 we estimated the fair values of our fixedrate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 

interest rate fair value hedges – we manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period we generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings we employ derivatives primarily swaps as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix in addition we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixedrate debt securities 

swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt’s fair value attributable to the changes in interest rates we account for swaps as fair value hedges using the shortcut method pursuant to financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  therefore we do not record any ineffectiveness within our consolidated financial statements 

interest rate cash flow hedges – we report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affects earnings at december 31 2007 and 2006 we had reductions of 4 million and 5 million respectively recorded as an accumulated other comprehensive loss that is being amortized on a straightline basis through september 30 2014 as of december 31 2007 and 2006 we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding 

  

fuel swaps – two fuel basis swaps cover a total of 151 million gallons of diesel fuel for the period august 2006 through july 2008 these commodity basis swaps require us to make payments to or receive payments from the counterparty based on the difference between certain price indices changes in the fair value of these swaps are reflected in fuel expense we reported a derivative asset of approximately 1 million and 2 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively which represents the fair value of the swaps the swaps increased fuel expense for 2007 by 1 million and reduced fuel expense for 2006 by 3 million the recognition of the swaps in fuel expense included monthly net settlements with the counterparty and the change in fair value 

accounting pronouncements – in september 2006 the fasb issued statement no 157 fair value measurements fas 157 fas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements this statement does not require any new fair value measurements rather it applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements the provisions of fas 157 are effective for us beginning in 2008 we expect this new standard will result in increased disclosures but will not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in february 2007 the fasb issued statement no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities fas 159 the fair value option established by fas 159 permits but does not require all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates an entity would report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date fas 159 is effective for us beginning in 2008 we do not currently intend to elect the fair value option for any eligible items and do not expect this standard to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement no 141 revised 2007 business combinations fas 141r fas 141r will change the accounting for business combinations under fas 141r an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisitiondate fair value with limited exceptions fas 141r will also change the accounting treatment and disclosures with respect to certain specific items in a business combination fas 141r applies to us prospectively for business combinations occurring on or after january 1 2009 accordingly any business combinations we engage in will be recorded and disclosed following existing gaap until january 1 2009 we expect fas 141r will have an impact on accounting for business combinations but the effect will be dependent upon any potential future acquisitions 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements – an amendment of arb no 51 fas 160 fas 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary fas 160 is effective for us beginning in 2009 we are still assessing the potential impact if any of the adoption of fas 160 on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in december 2007 the fasb ratified the consensus reached on emerging issues task force eitf issue no 071 collaborative arrangements eitf 071 which defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting and disclosure requirements for transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement the requirements of this eitf will be applied to collaborative arrangements in existence on or after january 1 2009 we are still assessing the potential impact if any of the adoption of eitf 071 on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

asserted and unasserted claims – various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries we cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity however to the extent possible where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated we have recorded a liability we do not expect that any known lawsuits claims environmental costs commitments contingent liabilities or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of 

  

operations financial condition or liquidity after taking into account liabilities previously recorded for these matters 

indemnities – our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements including certain tax indemnifications can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions 

climate change – although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item 1a we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact however we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment including investments in new technologies using training programs to reduce fuel consumption and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenue expenses assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 1 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 these critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 

asbestos – we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other parties allege exposure to asbestos during 2004 we engaged a third party with extensive experience in estimating resolution costs for asbestosrelated claims to assist us in assessing our potential liability during 2007 we updated our potential liability to include actual claim experience since 2004 as a result of this reassessment we decreased our liability by 20 million in 2007 for both asserted and unasserted asbestosrelated claims through 2034 this liability excludes future defense and processing costs the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions 

 

  

  

  

   

our asbestosrelated liability activity was as follows 

 

 approximately 13 of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 87 related to unasserted claims these claims are expected to be paid out over the next 27 years in conjunction with the liability update performed in 2007 we also reassessed estimated insurance recoveries we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2007 and 2006 we will continue to review actual experience and adjust our estimate as warranted 

our asbestosrelated claims activity was as follows 

 

 we believe that our estimates of liability for asbestosrelated claims and insurance recoveries are reasonable and probable the amounts recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts however future events such as the number of new claims to be filed each year average settlement costs and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts estimates also may vary in the future if strategies activities and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change federal and state laws governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimants and there are material changes with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants 

environmental – we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations we identified 339 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements this includes 41 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government 22 of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site our environmental liability activity was as follows 

 

   

our environmental site activity was as follows 

 

 when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in our business we and our consultants perform environmental assessments on the property we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and we can reasonably estimate such costs we do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable 

the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties cost estimates are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and existing technology laws and regulations the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties sitespecific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal state and local laws governing environmental remediation current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

personal injury – the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year we use thirdparty actuaries to assist us in measuring the expense and liability including unasserted claims the federal employers’ liability act fela governs compensation for workrelated accidents under fela damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or outofcourt settlements we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 

our personal injury liability is discounted to present value using applicable us treasury rates approximately 89 of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 11 related to unasserted claims estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation our personal injury liability activity was as follows 

 

   

our personal injury claims activity was as follows 

 

 depreciation – the railroad industry is capital intensive properties are carried at cost provisions for depreciation are computed principally on the straightline method based on estimated service lives of depreciable property the lives are calculated using a separate composite annual percentage rate for each depreciable property group based on the results of internal depreciation studies we are required to submit a report on depreciation studies and proposed depreciation rates to the stb for review and approval every three years for equipment property and every six years for road property the cost net of salvage of depreciable railroad property retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized a gain or loss is recognized in other income for all other property upon disposition because the gain or loss is not part of rail operations the cost of internally developed software is capitalized and amortized based on estimated service lives of the software 

significant capital spending in recent years increased the total value of our depreciable assets cash capital spending totaled 25 billion for the year ended december 31 2007 for the year ended december 31 2007 depreciation expense was 13 billion we use various methods to estimate useful lives for each group of depreciable property due to the capital intensive nature of the business and the large base of depreciable assets variances to those estimates could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately 47 million if the estimated useful lives of all assets to be depreciated were decreased by one year annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately 50 million 

income taxes – as required under fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes  we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns these expected future consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted the effects of future changes in tax law are not anticipated future tax law changes such as a change in the corporate tax rate could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations for example a 1 increase in the federal income tax rate would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately 250 million 

when appropriate we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized based on management’s judgments regarding the best available evidence about future events based on that analysis there was no valuation allowance at december 31 2007 or 2006 

when we have claimed tax benefits that may be challenged by a tax authority these uncertain tax benefits are accounted for under fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 we adopted fin 48 beginning january 1 2007 prior to 2007 income tax contingencies were accounted for under fasb statement no 5 accounting for contingencies  

under fin 48 we recognize tax benefits only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement a liability for “unrecognized tax benefits” is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement 

  

standards for additional information on the adoption of fin 48 see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefits – we use thirdparty actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and defined contribution medical and life insurance benefits opeb to eligible employees in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make several assumptions the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets for opeb the critical assumptions are the discount rate and healthcare cost trend rate 

we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually and selected assumptions are based on the following factors 

 

  

  

 the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure pension and opeb expense for 2007 and the estimated impact on 2007 pension and opeb expense relative to a change in those assumptions

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

the management of union pacific corporation and subsidiary companies the corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f the corporation’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the corporation’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 

all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

the corporation’s management assessed the effectiveness of the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 in making this assessment it used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control – integrated framework based on our assessment management believes that as of december 31 2007 the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 

the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting this report appears on page 80

union pacific corporation its directors and shareholders 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of union pacific corporation and subsidiary companies the corporation as of december 31 2007 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended december 31 2007 of the corporation and our report dated february 15 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the corporation’s adoption in 2006 of statement of financial accounting standards no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans

operations 

  

the railroad along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates is our one reportable operating segment although revenue is analyzed by commodity group we analyze the net financial results of the railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of our rail network additional information regarding our operations is presented in selected financial data item 6 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item 7 and the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 

  

  

   

agricultural – transporting agricultural products including whole grains commodities produced from these grains and food and beverage products provided 16 of the railroad’s 2006 commodity revenue with access to most major grain markets the railroad provides a critical link between the midwest and western producing areas and export terminals in the pacific northwest pnw and gulf ports as well as mexico unit trains of grain efficiently shuttle between producers and export terminals or domestic markets uprr also serves significant domestic markets including grain processors animal feeders and ethanol producers in the midwest west south and rocky mountain states primary food commodities consist of a variety of fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables dairy products and beverages which are moved to major us population centers for consumption express lane and our recently inaugurated produce unit train our premium perishables services that move fruits and vegetables from the pnw and california with priority service to destinations in the east compete with the trucking industry we transport frozen meat and poultry to the west coast ports for export while beverages primarily beer enter the us from mexico 

  

automotive – uprr is the largest automotive carrier west of the mississippi river serving seven vehicle assembly plants and distributing imported vehicles from six west coast ports and houston the railroad offloads finished vehicles at 38 vehicle distribution centers for delivery by truck to all major western us cities in addition to transporting finished vehicles uprr provides expedited handling of automotive parts in both boxcars and intermodal containers to several assembly plants the railroad carries automotive materials bound for assembly plants in mexico the us and canada and transports finished vehicles from manufacturing facilities in mexico in 2006 transportation of finished vehicles and automotive materials accounted for 10 of the railroad’s commodity revenue 

  

chemicals – transporting chemicals provided 14 of the railroad’s commodity revenue in 2006 the railroad’s franchise enables it to serve the chemical producing areas along the gulf coast as well as the rocky mountain region twothirds of the chemicals business consists of liquid and dry chemicals plastics and liquid petroleum products in addition to transporting plastics customers also leverage uprr’s storageintransit yards for intermediate storage of plastic resins soda ash shipments originate in southwestern wyoming and california destined primarily for glass producing markets in the east the west and abroad fertilizer movements originate 

  

primarily in the gulf coast region as well as the west and canada bound for major agricultural users in the midwest and the western us 

  

energy – coal transportation accounted for 20 of the railroad’s 2006 commodity revenue the railroad’s geographic network allows it to transport coal destined for utilities and industrial facilities in 27 states as well as to the gulf and railbargeship facilities on the mississippi and ohio rivers and the great lakes uprr serves mines located in the southern powder river basin of wyoming sprb colorado utah southern wyoming and southern illinois sprb coal represents the largest growth segment of the market as utilities continue to favor its lower cost and lowsulfur content 

  

industrial products – the railroad’s extensive network enables the industrial products group to move numerous commodities between thousands of origin and destination points throughout north america lumber shipments originate primarily in the pnw and canada for destinations throughout the united states for new home construction and repair and remodeling commercial and highway construction drives shipments of steel and construction products consisting of rock cement and roofing materials paper and consumer goods including furniture and appliances are shipped to major metropolitan areas for consumers nonferrous metals and industrial minerals are moved for industrial manufacturing in addition the railroad provides efficient and safe transportation for government entities and waste companies in 2006 transporting industrial products provided 21 of the railroad’s commodity revenue 

  

intermodal – uprr’s intermodal business which represented 19 of the railroad’s 2006 commodity revenue includes international domestic and premium shipments international business consists of imported container traffic that arrives at west coast ports via steamship for destinations throughout the united states domestic business includes domestic container and trailer traffic for intermodal marketing companies primarily shipper agents and consolidators and truckload carriers lessthantruckload and package carriers with timesensitive business requirements account for the majority of our premium service 

  

working capital – we currently have and historically have had a working capital deficit which is common in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity or financial stability we maintain adequate resources to meet our daily cash requirements and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

  

competition – we are subject to competition from other railroads motor carriers and barge operators our main rail competitor is burlington northern santa fe corporation its rail subsidiary bnsf railway company bnsf operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors in addition we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers motor carrier competition is particularly strong for five of our six commodity groups because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and gulf coast waterways barge competition can be particularly effective especially for grain and bulk commodities in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service while we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation or legislation releasing motor carriers from their size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

equipment suppliers – we depend on two key domestic suppliers of locomotives due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of this equipment high barriers to entry face potential new suppliers therefore if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives we could experience a significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations 

  

employees – approximately 87 of our 50739 fulltimeequivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions in january 2005 we began the current round of negotiations with the unions existing agreements remain in effect and will continue to remain in effect until new agreements are reached or the railway labor act’s 

  

procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential intervention are exhausted contract negotiations with the various unions generally take place over an extended period of time and we rarely experience work stoppages during negotiations the current agreements provide for periodic cost of living wage increases until new agreements are reached

governmental regulation – our operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local regulations generally applicable to all businesses see also the discussion of certain regulatory proceedings in legal proceedings item 3 

  

the operations of the railroad are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board stb of the united states department of transportation dot the operations of the railroad are also subject to the regulations of the federal railroad administration fra of the dot and other federal and state agencies the stb has jurisdiction over rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic freight car compensation transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines and acquisition of control of rail common carriers on january 26 2007 the stb issued a decision limiting the manner in which us railroads can calculate fuel surcharges on traffic regulated by the stb 

  

dot and the occupational safety and health administration along with other federal agencies have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety movement of hazardous materials movement and disposal of hazardous waste emissions requirements and equipment standards various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law 

  

environmental regulation – we are subject to extensive federal and state environmental statutes and regulations pertaining to public health and the environment the statutes and regulations are administered and monitored by the environmental protection agency epa and by various state environmental agencies the primary laws affecting our operations are the resource conservation and recovery act regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act regulating the cleanup of contaminated properties the clean air act regulating air emissions and the clean water act regulating waste water discharges 

  

information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies – environmental item 7 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

the information set forth in this item 1a should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this report including item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

  

we must manage both significant demand for our services and network capacity – due to continuing demand for rail service and capacity constraints we may experience network difficulties including congestion and reduced velocity which may compromise the level of service we provide to our customers this level of demand may compound the impact of weather and weatherrelated events on our operations and velocity although we continue to improve our transportation plan add capacity and improve operations at our yards and other facilities we cannot be sure that these measures will fully or adequately address any service shortcomings additionally ongoing maintenance restoration and improvements in the sprb could adversely affect coal shipments during the year we also cannot be sure that we will not experience other difficulties related to 

  

network capacity dramatic and unplanned increases of demand for rail service in one or more of our commodity groups or other events that could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures – the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage environmental liability and other matters any material changes to litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving any or all of property damage personal injury and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we are required to transport hazardous materials – federal laws require railroads including uprr to transport hazardous materials any rail accident involving the release of hazardous materials could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury property damage and environmental penalties and remediation which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

the availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations – changes in demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel particularly engineers and trainmen could negatively impact our ability to meet demand for rail service unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we are subject to significant governmental regulation – we are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal state and local authorities covering a variety of health safety labor environmental as discussed below and other matters our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us governments may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate without providing us with any recourse for any adverse effects on our business economic reregulation of the rail industry would negatively impact our ability to determine prices for rail services and reduce capital spending on our rail network resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity also some laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses permits and other authorizations and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so in addition one or more consolidations of class i railroads could lead to future reregulation of the rail industry 

  

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures – severe weather conditions events and other natural phenomena including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods extreme temperatures and significant precipitation may cause business interruptions including line outages on our rail network that can adversely affect our entire rail network and result in increased costs increased liabilities and decreased revenue which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations as the majority of our employees belong to labor unions and labor agreements – we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in january 2005 we began the current round of negotiations with the unions disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in among other things strikes work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers if unionized workers were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown or other employees were to become unionized we could experience a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could compromise our service reliability and significantly increase our costs for healthcare wages and other benefits which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations – we rely on information technology in all aspects of our business if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if we are unable to implement new technology we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally if we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment we could experience a service interruption safety failure security breach or other operational difficulties which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we are subject to significant environmental laws and regulations – our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waters handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and hazardous material or petroleum releases we generate and transport hazardous and nonhazardous waste in our operations and we did so in our former operations environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties leased properties and properties owned by third parties as well as to properties we currently own environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation we have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated or are strictly liable under these laws or regulations we could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

rising or elevated fuel costs and whether we are able to mitigate these costs with fuel surcharges could materially and adversely affect our business – fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses diesel fuel prices are subject to dramatic fluctuations and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results although we currently are able to recover a significant amount of our increased fuel expenses through revenue from fuel surcharges we cannot be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elevated fuel costs through surcharges future market conditions or legislative or regulatory activities could adversely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharges or adequately recover increased fuel costs through fuel surcharges international political and economic circumstances affect fuel prices and supplies weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity if a fuel supply shortage were to arise from opec production curtailments a disruption of oil imports or other causes higher fuel prices could despite our fuel surcharge programs have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we face competition from other railroads and other transportation providers – we face competition from other railroads motor carriers and to a lesser extent ships barges and pipelines in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service while we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation or legislation releasing motor carriers from their size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect the competitive environment in which we operate 

  

we may be affected by general economic conditions – prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions affecting the producers and consumers of the commodities carried by us may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we utilize capital markets – we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements including the issuance of commercial paper from time to time and the sale of certain of our receivables market instability or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit 

  

our access to commercial paper and reduce our credit ratings below investment grade which would prohibit us from utilizing our sale of receivables program and significantly increase the cost of issuing debt 

  

we are dependent on two key domestic suppliers of locomotives – due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment high barriers to entry face potential new suppliers therefore if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives we could experience a significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations 

  

we may be affected by acts of terrorism war or risk of war – our rail lines facilities and equipment including rail cars carrying hazardous materials could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks terrorist attacks or other similar events any government response thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in addition insurance premiums for some or all of our current coverages could increase dramatically or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future

as we reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2004 the illinois attorney general’s office filed an agreed order and complaint and a complaint for injunctive and other relief on october 7 2004 in the circuit court for the twentieth judicial circuit st clair county against the alton  southern railway company a whollyowned subsidiary of the railroad as a result of a collision and derailment on september 21 2004 the state of illinois seeks to enjoin the alton  southern railway company from further violations as well as a monetary penalty the amount of the proposed penalty is uncertain but could exceed 100000 

  

as we reported in our annual report on form 10k for 2005 we received information in 2001 indicating epa considered the railroad a potentially responsible party for the omaha lead site the omaha lead site consists of approximately 12800 acres of residential property in the eastern part of omaha nebraska allegedly impacted by air emissions from two former lead smeltersrefineries one refinery was operated by asarco epa identified the railroad as a potentially responsible party because more than 60 years ago the railroad owned land that was leased to asarco the railroad disputes both the legal and technical base for epa’s allegations it has nonetheless engaged in extensive negotiations with epa these negotiations have reached an apparent impasse epa issued a unilateral administrative order with an effective date of december 16 2005 directing the railroad to implement an interim remedy at the site at an estimated cost of 50 million failure to comply with the order without just cause could subject the railroad to penalties of up to 32500 per day and triple epa’s costs in performing the work the railroad believes it has just cause not to comply with the order but it offered to perform some of the work specified in the order as a compromise epa rejected this offer the railroad will vigorously contest liability and the imposition of any penalties 

  

as we reported in our annual report on form 10k for 2005 the illinois attorney general’s office filed a complaint in the circuit court for the twentyfirst judicial circuit st clair county seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties against the railroad relating to a collision between uprr and norfolk southern railway company ns trains near momence illinois on november 24 2005 the collision derailed approximately five locomotives and 30 railcars two of the uprr locomotives and two of the ns locomotives caught fire and four of the locomotives released approximately 16000 gallons of diesel fuel other cars carrying food products derailed and released an unknown amount of product the railroad promptly responded and remediation is ongoing the state of illinois seeks a permanent injunction against the railroad ordering uprr to continue remediation the state of illinois seeks to enjoin uprr from further violations and a monetary penalty the amount of the proposed penalty is uncertain

free cash flow is not considered a financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk we believe free cash flow is important in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financings free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for cash provided by operating activities the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities gaap measure to free cash flow nongaap measure 

  

   

2007 outlook 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

results of operations 

  

operating revenue 

  

   

operating revenue includes commodity revenue and other revenue other revenue consists primarily of revenue earned by our subsidiaries revenue from our commuter rail operations and accessorial revenue which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us we recognize commodity revenue on a percentageofcompletion basis as freight moves from origin to destination we allocate commodity revenue between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them we recognize other revenue as service is performed or contractual obligations are met customer incentives which are primarily provided for shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping tofrom specific locations are recorded as a reduction to revenue based on actual or projected future customer shipments 

  

all six commodity groups experienced double digit revenue growth during 2006 with particularly strong growth of over 20 in agricultural commodity revenue price increases fuel surcharges and indexbased contract escalators which are formulas in our shipping contracts that correlate price adjustments to certain economic indices all contributed to higher average revenue per car arc our fuel surcharge programs excluding indexbased contract escalators that contain some provision for fuel generated an additional 656 million in commodity revenue compared to 2005 contributing 5 to commodity revenue growth volume increased 3 during the year led by solid growth in intermodal and energy shipments which was partially offset by lower shipments of industrial products and chemicals the yearoveryear growth was also partially attributable to lower volume in 2005 due to the january west coast storm sprb joint line disruptions hurricane rita and the kansas washouts 

  

commodity revenue improved in all six business groups during 2005 with doubledigit growth in the agricultural industrial products and intermodal commodity groups fuel surcharges price increases and indexbased contract escalators all contributed to higher arc our fuel surcharge programs excluding indexbased contract escalators that contain some provision for fuel generated an additional 671 million in commodity revenue compared to 2004 which represents approximately 70 of the additional expense incurred above the base fuel price for our fuel surcharge programs currently 075 per gallon although volume grew 1 for the year the severe weather and maintenance and restoration on the sprb joint line constrained volume growth 

  

other revenue increased in 2006 mainly driven by higher volumes in addition we generated higher subsidiary revenue from bay pacific financial llc bay pacific an intermodal leasing entity following the acquisition of our joint venture partner’s interest in bay pacific during the third quarter of 2005 subsidiary and accessorial revenue increased other revenue in 2005 mainly driven by higher volumes and the acquisition of bay pacific 

  

the following tables summarize the yearoveryear changes in commodity revenue revenue carloads and average revenue per car by commodity group 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

mexico business  – each commodity group discussed above includes revenue from shipments to and from mexico revenue from mexico business increased 23 to 14 billion in 2006 compared to 2005 price increases fuel surcharges and shipments of finished vehicles automotive parts import beer dry feed ingredients and 

  

intermodal drove revenue growth in 2006 volume declines in coal newsprint and sulfur shipments partially offset the increases 

  

in 2005 revenue from mexico grew 15 to 11 billion resulting primarily from price increases and fuel surcharges carloads were flat versus 2004 as fewer automotive parts energy and intermodal shipments offset higher agricultural and industrial shipments 

  

operating expenses 

  

   

   

operating expenses increased 863 million in 2005 versus 2004 excluding the asbestos charge of 247 million pretax in 2004 operating expenses increased 11 billion or 10 significantly higher locomotive fuel prices accounted for 740 million of this increase our fuel surcharge programs helped offset these expenses in the form of higher revenue inflation in wages benefits materials and services as well as a larger workforce resulted in most of the additional increase also driving higher operating expenses were increased contract services and cleanup and restoration costs associated with the 2005 january west coast storm 

  

salaries wages and employee benefits  – general wage and benefit inflation increased expenses in 2006 reflecting higher salaries and wages and the impact of higher healthcare costs and other benefit costs a larger workforce driven by higher volume levels and stock option expense required by new accounting rules also contributed to higher expenses conversely reduced protection costs and operational improvements boosted by network management initiatives and investment in capacity partially offset these increases protection costs represent the differential payment when the wage earned for active employment is lower than an employee’s protected rate of pay an individual’s protected rate is imposed by the stb for employees adversely affected by a merger or is established by collective bargaining agreements with our labor unions in certain cases additionally we incurred higher labor expenses in 2005 for cleanup and restoration of property damaged by the january west coast storm 

  

several factors drove higher employment expenses in 2005 general wage and benefit inflation increased expenses reflecting higher salaries and wages and the yearoveryear impact of higher healthcare and other benefits costs we also incurred higher expenses for management bonuses in 2005 as executive bonuses were not awarded for 2004 and bonuses for the professional workforce were significantly reduced in 2004 a 3 increase in our workforce and higher demand during 2005 also contributed to the increases additionally labor expenses in the form of higher train crew costs and labor incurred for repair and cleanup activities increased due to the hurricanes in the third quarter and the west coast storm in the first quarter reduced severance and relocation costs increased network efficiency and reduced training expenses partially offset these increases transferring various support personnel to omaha nebraska resulted in higher severance and relocation costs in 2004 

  

fuel and utilities 

  

   

fuel and utilities include locomotive fuel utilities other than telephone and gasoline and other fuels higher diesel fuel prices which averaged 206 per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in 2006 compared to 177 per gallon in 2005 increased expenses by 393 million a 3 increase in gross tonmiles resulted in 63 million of additional expenses which was partially offset by a 2 improvement in our fuel consumption rate due to the use of newer more fuelefficient locomotives and our fuel conservation programs as noted above and described in this item 7 we offset a significant portion of increased locomotive fuel expenses through revenue from fuel surcharges gasoline utilities and propane and other fuel expenses increased 20 million in 2006 due to higher prices and increased usage 

  

in 2005 diesel fuel prices averaged 177 per gallon compared to 122 per gallon in 2004 increasing expenses by 740 million a 1 increase in gross tonmiles resulted in 8 million of additional expenses we offset 39 million of these increases with a 2 improvement in our consumption rate in 2005 versus 2004 the railroad had no fuel hedges in place during 2005 whereas we hedged 120 million gallons of fuel in 2004 gasoline utilities and propane expenses increased 37 million in 2005 versus 2004 due to higher prices 

  

equipment and other rents  – equipment and other rents primarily includes rental expense the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies freight car intermodal and locomotive leases other 

  

specialty equipment leases and office and other rentals lease expense increased in 2006 compared to 2005 as we leased more locomotives and freight cars growth in automotive and intermodal shipments also increased our shortterm freight car rental expense improved carcycle times driven by network management initiatives partially offset this increase 

  

in 2005 the number of leased locomotives and freight cars increased resulting in higher lease expense carload volume growth also increased 2005 expenses improved carcycle times partially offset these increases which lowered our shortterm freight car rental expense 

  

depreciation  – the majority of depreciation relates to track structure including rail ties and other track material a higher depreciable asset base reflecting higher capital spending in recent years and increased usage of our assets combined for higher depreciation expense in 2006 and 2005 

  

materials and supplies  – materials used to maintain the railroad’s lines structures and equipment are the principal components of materials and supplies expense this expense item also includes small tools office supplies other materials and the costs of freight services to ship railroad supplies and materials we used more repair materials at higher component costs to repair and maintain freight cars and our fleet of locomotives in 2006 including a growing number of units not covered by warranties in addition we performed more maintenance on locomotives that were maintained internally and not subject to maintenance contracts with thirdparty contractors compared to 2005 

  

during 2005 materials and supplies expense increased primarily due to locomotive and freight car maintenance we used more repair materials to maintain a larger fleet of locomotives including a growing number of units not covered by warranties additionally we incurred higher costs for car wheel sets traction motors and lube oil conversely we incurred lower freight charges for shipping railroad materials and stationery and office supplies 

  

casualty costs  – personal injury costs freight and property damage insurance and environmental expense are the primary components of casualty costs costs were flat in 2006 compared to 2005 as lower bad debt expenses lower freight damage expenses and lower expenses for destruction of foreign or leased equipment all offset personal injury costs and higher settlement expenses 

  

in 2005 casualty costs were lower than the previous year primarily due to higher expenses incurred in 2004 for an asbestos charge a costly derailment near san antonio and a large jury verdict – affirmed in 2004 – for a 1998 crossing accident lower freight and property damage expense and lower costs for destruction of foreign or leased equipment also reduced casualty costs conversely we incurred higher insurance costs and increased costs for thirdparty personal injuries and damages related to environmental exposures 

  

purchased services and other costs  – purchased services and other costs include the costs of services purchased from outside contractors state and local taxes net costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other railroads transportation and lodging for train crew employees trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers leased automobile maintenance expenses telephone and cellular expense employee travel expense and computer and other general expenses volumerelated expenses including crew transportation and lodging costs increased in 2006 driven by 3 growth of carloads higher state and local taxes primarily sales and use taxes related to higher diesel fuel prices also increased expenses in 2006 compared to 2005 conversely lower locomotive contract maintenance costs and lower expenses associated with jointlyowned operating facilities reduced expenses in 2006 compared to 2005 settlement of all remaining insurance claims related to the 2005 january west coast storm and the gain from the sale of two airplanes also reduced expenses in 2006 finally cleanup and restoration costs related to the january west coast storm increased expenses in 2005 which also contributed to lower yearoveryear expenses in 2006 

  

expenses increased in 2005 versus 2004 because we experienced higher volumerelated costs for freight car and locomotive contract maintenance and crew transportation and lodging although our intermodal carloadings 

  

increased over 4 in 2005 costs for trucking services provided by intermodal carriers remained flat as we substantially reduced expenses associated with network inefficiencies higher diesel fuel prices increased sales and use taxes in 2005 which resulted in higher state and local taxes other contract expenses for equipment maintenance and other services increased in 2005 the 2005 january west coast storm and hurricanes katrina and rita also contributed to higher expenses in 2005 net of insurance settlements received partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in relocation expenses as we incurred higher relocation costs associated with moving support personnel to omaha nebraska during 2004 

  

nonoperating items 

  

   

other income  – lower net gains from nonoperating asset sales and higher expenses due to rising interest rates associated with our sale of receivables program resulted in a reduction in other income in 2006 which was partially offset by higher rental income for the use of our rightofway including 2006 settlements of rate disputes from prior years and cash investment returns due to higher interest rates 

  

in 2005 other income increased largely as a result of higher gains from real estate sales partially offset by higher expenses due to rising interest rates associated with our sale of receivables program 

  

interest expense  – lower interest expense in 2006 and 2005 was primarily due to declining weightedaverage debt levels of 71 billion 78 billion and 81 billion in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively a higher effective interest rate of 67 in 2006 compared to 65 in both 2005 and 2004 partially offset the effects of the declining debt level 

  

income taxes  – income tax expense was 509 million higher in 2006 than 2005 higher pretax income resulted in additional taxes of 414 million and 118 million of the increase resulted from the onetime reduction in 2005 described below our effective tax rate was 364 and 286 in 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

income taxes were greater in 2005 than 2004 due to higher pretax income partially offset by a previously reported reduction in income tax expense in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2005 we reported that the corporation analyzed the impact that final settlements of pre1995 tax years had on previously recorded estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities the completed analysis of the final settlements for pre1995 tax years along with internal revenue service examination reports for tax years 1995 through 2002 were considered among other things in a review and reevaluation of the corporation’s estimated deferred tax assets and liabilities as of september 30 2005 resulting in an income tax expense reduction of 118 million in 2005 

  

operating and financial statistics 

  

railroad performance measures 

  

we report key railroad performance measures weekly to the association of american railroads including carloads average daily inventory of rail cars on our system average train speed and average terminal dwell time this operating data is available on our website at wwwupcominvestorsreportsindexshtml 

  

operating statistics 

  

   

average train speed – average train speed is calculated by dividing train miles by hours operated on our main lines between terminals ongoing network management initiatives and capacity expansion allowed us to move 3 more carloads in 2006 and improve average train speed 1 in 2005 the january west coast storm disruptions on the sprb joint line business interruptions caused by hurricane rita and the kansas washouts in october hampered efforts to improve our average train speed 

  

average terminal dwell time – average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our terminals lower average terminal dwell time is favorable average terminal dwell improved 5 and 6 in 2006 and 2005 respectively as a result of ongoing management initiatives and directed efforts to more timely deliver rail cars offline to our interchange partners and customers 

  

gross and revenue tonmiles – gross tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded or empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled revenue tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles in 2006 gross and revenue tonmiles grew 3 in relation to the 3 increase in carloadings as volume was balanced between the higher and lower density commodities in 2005 gross tonmiles grew 1 in relation to a 1 increase of carloadings revenue tonmiles were flat in 2005 

  

average fulltime equivalent employees – higher employee levels in 2006 and 2005 included more people to maintain our larger locomotive and freight car fleet the addition of employees needed to complete increased track repair and replacement programs the hiring of operations management personnel including an expanded management training program and train and engine personnel to manage current demand 

  

return on invested capital 

  

   

return on invested capital roic is considered a nongaap financial measure by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk we believe this measure is important in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the corporation’s longterm capital investments and we currently use roic as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of compensation for our executive officers and senior management roic should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for other information provided in accordance with gaap a comparable gaap measure is return on equity which is included in selected financial data item 6 

  

debt to capitallease adjusted debt to capital 

  

   

   

lease adjusted debt to capital is considered a nongaap financial measure by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation sk we believe this measure is important in evaluating the total amount of leverage in our capital structure including offbalance sheet lease obligations we monitor the ratio of lease adjusted debt to capital as we manage our capital structure to balance cost effective and efficient access to the capital markets with the corporation’s overall cost of capital lease adjusted debt to capital should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for debt to capital the table above provides support for the lease adjusted debt to capital calculation our debt to capital ratios improved as a result of a 636 million reduction in debt from december 31 2005 and an increase in retained earnings due to higher net income in 2006 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

as of december 31 2006 our principal sources of liquidity included cash cash equivalents the sale of receivables and our revolving credit facilities as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets we had 2 billion of committed credit facilities available of which there were no borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2006 and we did not make any shortterm borrowings under these facilities during the year the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the sale of receivables program was 600 million as of december 31 2006 the sale of receivables program is subject to certain requirements including the maintenance of an investment grade bond rating if our bond rating were to deteriorate it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity access to commercial paper is dependent on market conditions deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to utilize commercial paper as a source of liquidity liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability 

  

at both december 31 2006 and 2005 we had a working capital deficit of approximately 11 billion a working capital deficit is common in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity we maintain adequate resources to meet our daily cash requirements and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

  

financial condition 

  

   

cash provided by operating activities – higher income in 2006 generated the increased cash provided by operating activities which was partially offset by higher income tax payments 150 million in voluntary pension contributions higher material and supply inventories and higher management incentive payments in 2006 higher income lower management incentive payments in 2005 executive bonuses which would have been paid to individuals in 2005 were not awarded based on company performance in 2004 and bonuses for the professional workforce that were paid out in 2005 were significantly reduced and working capital performance generated higher cash from operating activities in 2005 a voluntary pension contribution of 100 million in 2004 also augmented the positive yearoveryear variance in 2005 as no pension contribution was made in 2005 this improvement was partially offset by cash received in 2004 for income tax refunds 

  

cash used in investing activities – an insurance settlement for the 2005 january west coast storm and lower balances for work in process decreased the amount of cash used in investing activities in 2006 higher capital investments and lower proceeds from asset sales partially offset this decrease increased capital spending partially offset by higher proceeds from asset sales increased the amount of cash used in investing activities in 2005 compared to 2004 

  

cash used in financing activities – the increase in cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from lower net proceeds from equity compensation plans 189 million in 2006 compared to 262 million in 2005 the increase in 2005 results from debt issuances in 2004 and higher debt repayments in 2005 we did not issue debt in 2005 versus 745 million of debt issuances in 2004 and we repaid 699 million of debt in 2005 compared to 588 million in 2004 the higher outflows in 2005 were partially offset by higher net proceeds from equity compensation plans 262 million in 2005 compared to 80 million in 2004 

  

the table below details cash capital investments for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 

  

   

in 2007 we expect our total capital investments to be approximately 32 billion which may include longterm leases these investments will be used to maintain track and structures continue capacity expansions on our main lines in constrained corridors remove bottlenecks upgrade and augment equipment to better meet customer needs build and improve facilities and terminals and develop and implement new technologies we designed these investments to maintain infrastructure for safety enhance customer service promote growth and improve operational fluidity we expect to fund our 2007 cash capital investments through cash generated from operations the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties and cash on hand at december 31 2006 we expect that these sources will continue to provide sufficient funds to meet our expected capital requirements for 2007 

  

for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 44 29 and 21 respectively the increases in 2006 and 2005 were driven by higher net income the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis earnings represent income from continuing operations less equity earnings net of distributions plus fixed charges and income taxes fixed charges represent interest charges amortization of debt discount and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges see exhibit 12 for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

  

financing activities 

  

credit facilities   – on december 31 2006 we had 2 billion in revolving credit facilities available including 1 billion under a fiveyear facility expiring in march 2009 and 1 billion under a fiveyear facility expiring in march 2010 collectively the facilities the facilities are designated for general corporate purposes and support the issuance of commercial paper neither of the facilities were drawn on in 2006 commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facilities are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investmentgrade borrowers these facilities allow for borrowings at floating rates based on london interbank offered rates plus a spread depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings the facilities require the maintenance of a minimum net worth and a debt to net worth coverage ratio at december 31 2006 we were in compliance with these covenants the facilities do not include any other financial restrictions credit rating triggers other than ratingdependent pricing or any other provision that could require the posting of collateral 

  

in addition to our revolving credit facilities we had 150 million in uncommitted lines of credit available including 75 million that expires in march 2007 and 75 million expiring in may 2007 neither of these lines of credit were used as of december 31 2006 we must have equivalent credit available under our fiveyear facilities to draw on these 75 million lines 

  

dividends – on january 30 2007 we increased the quarterly dividend to 035 per share payable beginning on april 2 2007 to shareholders of record on february 28 2007 we expect to fund the increase in the quarterly dividend through cash generated from operations the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties and cash on hand at december 31 2006 

  

dividend restrictions – we are subject to certain restrictions related to the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders due to minimum net worth requirements under our credit facilities retained earnings available 

  

for dividends increased to 78 billion at december 31 2006 from 62 billion at december 31 2005 we do not expect that these restrictions will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

  

common stock repurchases – on january 30 2007 our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our common stock through december 31 2009 we may make these repurchases on the open market or through other transactions our management will have sole discretion with respect to determining the timing and amount of these transactions we expect to fund our common stock repurchases through cash generated from operations the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties and cash on hand at december 31 2006 

  

shelf registration statement – under a current shelf registration statement we may issue any combination of debt securities preferred stock common stock or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings at december 31 2006 we had 500 million remaining for issuance under the current shelf registration statement we have no immediate plans to issue any securities however we routinely consider and evaluate opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under this shelf registration and therefore we may issue debt securities at any time 

  

operating lease activities 

  

as of december 31 2006 our contractual obligations for operating leases totaled approximately 55 billion discounted at 8 the present value of this obligation was approximately 35 billion the railroad as lessee entered into longterm operating lease arrangements during 2006 to finance the majority of its new equipment acquisitions in 2006 the lessors under these lease arrangements purchased 200 locomotives and 2100 freight cars from the corporation through various financing transactions with a total equipment cost of approximately 523 million and a present value of 427 million these new lease arrangements provide for minimum total rental payments of approximately 777 million and are reflected in the contractual obligations table as of december 31 2006 

  

the lessors financed the purchase of the locomotives and freight cars in part by the issuance of equipment notes that are nonrecourse to the railroad and are secured by an assignment of the underlying leases and a security interest in the various types of equipment neither the railroad nor upc guarantees payment of the equipment notes the railroad’s obligations to make operating lease payments under the leases are recourse obligations and are not recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position 

  

the railroad has certain renewal and purchase options with respect to the locomotives and freight cars if the railroad does not exercise any such options the equipment will be returned to the lessors at the end of the lease term 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

  

as described in the notes to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 and as referenced in the tables below we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition however based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments including material sources of offbalance sheet and structured finance arrangements there is no known trend demand commitment event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition the commercial obligations financings and commitments made by us are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations particularly within the transportation industry 

  

the following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of december 31 2006 

  

   

      

   

      

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

sale of receivables  – the railroad transfers most of its accounts receivable to union pacific receivables inc upri a bankruptcyremote subsidiary as part of a sale of receivables facility upri sells without recourse on a 364day revolving basis an undivided interest in such accounts receivable to investors the total capacity to sell undivided interests to investors under the facility was 600 million at both december 31 2006 and 2005 the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the facility was 600 million at both december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors is not included in our consolidated financial statements the value of the undivided interest held by investors was supported by 1158 million and 1226 million of accounts receivable held by upri at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively at december 31 2006 and 2005 the value of the interest retained by upri was 558 million and 626 million respectively this retained interest is included in accounts receivable in our consolidated financial statements the interest sold to investors is sold at carrying value which approximates fair value and there is no gain or loss recognized from the transaction 

  

the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors could fluctuate based upon the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks including default and dilution if default or dilution percentages were to increase one percentage point the amount of eligible receivables would decrease by 6 million should our credit rating fall below investment grade the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would be reduced and in certain cases the investors would have the right to discontinue the facility 

  

the railroad services the sold receivables however the railroad does not recognize any servicing asset or liability as the servicing fees adequately compensate the railroad for its responsibilities the railroad collected approximately 155 billion and 134 billion during the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively upri used certain of these proceeds to purchase new receivables under the facility 

  

the costs of the sale of receivables program are included in other income and were 33 million 23 million and 11 million for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the costs include interest program fees paid to banks commercial paper issuing costs and fees for unused commitment availability 

  

the investors have no recourse to the railroad’s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims creditors of the railroad have no recourse to the assets of upri in august 2006 the sale of receivables program was renewed for an additional 364day period without any significant changes in terms 

  

guarantees – at december 31 2006 we were contingently liable for 464 million in guarantees we have recognized a 6 million liability for the fair value of these obligations as of december 31 2006 we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business and they include guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building equipment financings and affiliated operations the final guarantee expires in 2022 we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

other matters 

  

inflation – the cumulative effect of long periods of inflation significantly increases asset replacement costs for capitalintensive companies as a result assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels depreciation charges on an inflationadjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 

  

derivative financial instruments – we may use derivative financial instruments in limited instances for other than trading purposes to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and fuel prices we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged both at inception and throughout the hedged period we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items as well as our riskmanagement objectives strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness changes in the fair market value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are charged to earnings we may use swaps collars futures andor forward contracts to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in interest rates and fuel prices however the use of these derivative financial instruments may limit future benefits from favorable price movements 

  

market and credit risk – we address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item credit risk related to derivative financial instruments which is minimal is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements at december 31 2006 and 2005 we were not required to provide collateral nor had we received collateral relating to our hedging activities 

  

determination of fair value – we determined the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions at december 31 2006 and 2005 based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or developed based upon the present value of expected future cash flows 

  

sensitivity analyses – the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 

  

interest rate fair value hedges – we manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period we generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings we employ derivatives primarily swaps as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix in addition we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixedrate debt securities 

  

swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt’s fair value attributable to the changes in interest rates we account for swaps as fair value hedges using the shortcut method pursuant to financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  therefore we do not record any ineffectiveness within our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2006 and 2005 we had interest rate swaps hedging debt of 500 million and 750 million respectively 

  

at december 31 2006 and 2005 we had variablerate debt representing approximately 7 and 10 respectively of our total debt if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2007 than our december 31 2006 variable rate which was approximately 8 our interest expense would increase by approximately 5 million if variable interest rates averaged one percentage point higher in 2006 than our december 31 2005 variable rate which was approximately 7 our interest expense would have increased by approximately 7 million these amounts were determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the balances of our variablerate debt at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2006 and amounts to approximately 462 million at december 31 2006 market risk resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2005 amounted to approximately 535 million at december 31 2005 we estimated the fair values of our fixedrate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 

  

interest rate cash flow hedges – we report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affects earnings at december 31 2006 we had a reduction of 5 million recorded as an accumulated other comprehensive loss that is being amortized on a straightline basis through september 30 2014 as of december 31 2006 and 2005 we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding 

  

fuel cash flow hedges – fuel costs are a significant portion of our total operating expenses in 2006 and 2005 our primary means of mitigating the impact of adverse fuel price changes was our fuel surcharge programs however we may use swaps collars futures andor forward contracts to further mitigate the impact of adverse fuel price changes we did not have any fuel hedges in place during 2006 or 2005 we hedged 120 million gallons of fuel during 2004 using collars with average cap floor and ceiling prices of 074 064 and 086 per gallon respectively 

  

fuel swaps – we entered into two fuel basis swaps for the period august 2006 through july 2008 which cover a total of 151 million gallons of diesel fuel these commodity basis swaps require us to make payments to 

  

or receive payments from the counterparty based on the difference between certain price indices changes in the fair value of these swaps are reflected in fuel expense we reported a derivative asset of approximately 2 million at december 31 2006 which represents the fair value of the swaps the swaps reduced fuel expense for 2006 by 3 million which included monthly net settlements with the counterparty and the fair value recognition at december 31 2006 

  

accounting pronouncements – in june 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 under the interpretation we will recognize tax benefits only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities the amount recognized will be measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the interpretation is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2007 the cumulative effect of adopting fin 48 will be a onetime reduction in the january 1 2007 balance of retained earnings future changes in uncertain tax positions will be included in income tax expense we do not expect that the cumulative effect of adopting fin 48 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement no 157 fair value measurement fas 157 while this statement does not require new fair value measurements it provides guidance on applying fair value and expands required disclosures fas 157 is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2008 we are currently assessing the impact fas 157 may have on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans fas 158 fas 158 required us to recognize the funded status of our pension and postretirement plans in the balance sheet along with a corresponding noncash aftertax adjustment to shareholders’ equity funded status is determined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation changes in the funded status will be recognized in other comprehensive loss we adopted fas 158 at the end of 2006 and have disclosed the impact of the adoption in note 7 of the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 

  

in september 2006 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 108 sab 108 provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of prioryear uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in the currentyear financial statements sab 108 requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both an income statement and balance sheet approach and then evaluate whether either approach results in a misstatement that when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered is material if prioryear errors that had been previously considered immaterial are now considered material based on either approach no restatement is required so long as management properly applied its previous approach and all relevant facts and circumstances were considered if prioryear’s financial statements are not restated the cumulative effect adjustment is recorded in opening accumulated earnings deficit as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption sab 108 was effective for us at the end of 2006 the adoption of sab 108 did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in february 2007 the fasb issued statement no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  fas 159   this statement which is expected to expand fair value measurement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value fas 159 is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2008 we are currently assessing the impact fas 159 may have on our consolidated financial statements 

  

asserted and unasserted claims – various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries it is not possible at this time for us to determine fully the effect of all unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity however to the extent possible where unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated we have recorded 

  

a liability we do not expect that any known lawsuits claims environmental costs commitments contingent liabilities or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity after taking into account liabilities previously recorded for these matters 

  

indemnities – our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements including certain tax indemnifications can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions 

  

insurance subsidiaries – we have two consolidated whollyowned subsidiaries that provide insurance coverage for certain risks including physical loss or property damage and certain other claims that are subject to reinsurance 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenue expenses assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 1 to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 these critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 

  

asbestos – we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees allege exposure to asbestos during 2004 we engaged a third party with extensive experience in estimating resolution costs for asbestosrelated claims to assist us in assessing our potential liability as a result of this assessment we increased our liability in 2004 for resolving both asserted and unasserted asbestosrelated claims through 2034 this liability excludes future defense and processing costs the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions 

  

   

   

   

   

our asbestosrelated liabilities were 302 million and 311 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively the current portion of asbestosrelated liabilities was 13 million and 16 million respectively approximately 16 of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 84 related to unasserted claims these claims are expected to be paid out over the next 28 years we have insurance coverage for a portion of the costs incurred to resolve asbestosrelated claims and as a result of the 2004 assessment we increased our receivable for insurance recoveries related to asbestos during 2004 we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31 2006 and 2005 

  

our asbestosrelated claims activity was as follows 

  

   

during 2006 and 2005 our thirdparty consultants assisted us in reviewing our actual asbestos claim experience compared to the assumptions used in the 2004 estimate and we determined that no adjustment was necessary we will continue to review actual experience and adjust our estimate as warranted 

  

we believe that our liability for asbestosrelated claims and the estimated insurance recoveries reflect reasonable and probable estimates the amounts recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts however future events such as the number of new claims to be filed each year average settlement costs and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts estimates may also vary due to changes to strategies activities and outcomes of asbestos litigation federal and state law governing litigation and compensation of asbestos claimants and the level of payments made to claimants by other defendants 

  

environmental – we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations we identified 367 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements this includes 44 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government 25 of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 

  

our environmental site activity was as follows 

  

   

when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in the conduct of our business we and our consultants perform environmental assessments on the property we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and we can reasonably estimate such costs we do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable 

  

environmental expense for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 were 39 million 45 million and 46 million respectively as of december 31 2006 and 2005 we had a liability of 210 million and 213 million respectively accrued for future environmental costs of which 54 million and 46 million respectively were recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties cost estimates are based on information available for each site financial viability of other 

  

potentially responsible parties and existing technology laws and regulations the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved sitespecific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

  

personal injury – the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year we use thirdparty actuaries to assist us with measuring the expense and liability including unasserted claims the federal employers’ liability act fela governs compensation for workrelated accidents under fela damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or outofcourt settlements we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work annual expenses for personal injuryrelated events were 240 million in 2006 247 million in 2005 and 288 million in 2004 as of december 31 2006 and 2005 we had accrued liabilities of 631 million and 619 million for future personal injury costs respectively of which 233 million and 274 million was recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs respectively our personal injury liability is discounted to present value using applicable us treasury rates approximately 87 of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 13 related to unasserted claims estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation 

  

our personal injury claims activity was as follows 

  

   

depreciation – the railroad industry is capital intensive properties are carried at cost provisions for depreciation are computed principally on the straightline method based on estimated service lives of depreciable property the lives are calculated using a separate composite annual percentage rate for each depreciable property group based on the results of internal depreciation studies we are required to submit a report on depreciation studies and proposed depreciation rates to the stb for review and approval every three years for equipment property and every six years for road property the cost net of salvage of depreciable railroad property retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized a gain or loss is recognized in other income for all other property upon disposition because the gain or loss is not part of rail operations the cost of internally developed software is capitalized and amortized over a fiveyear period 

  

significant capital spending in recent years increased the total value of our depreciable assets cash capital spending totaled 22 billion for the year ended december 31 2006 for the year ended december 31 2006 depreciation expense was 12 billion we use various methods to estimate useful lives for each group of depreciable property due to the capital intensive nature of the business and the large base of depreciable assets variances to those estimates could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately 43 million if the estimated useful lives of all assets to be depreciated were decreased by one year annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately 45 million 

  

income taxes – as required under fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes  we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns these 

  

expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated future tax law changes such as a change in the corporate tax rate could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations for example a 1 increase in the federal income tax rate would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately 245 million 

  

when appropriate we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized based in part on management’s judgments regarding the best available evidence about future events based on that analysis we recorded a valuation allowance of 5 million against certain deferred tax assets as of december 31 2005 there was no valuation allowance as of december 31 2006 

  

pension and other postretirement benefits – we use thirdparty actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and defined contribution medical and life insurance benefits opeb to eligible employees in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make several assumptions the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets for opeb the critical assumptions are the discount rate and healthcare cost trend rate 

  

we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually and selected assumptions are based on the following factors 

  

   

   

   

the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure pension and opeb expense for 2006 and the estimated impact on 2006 pension and opeb expense relative to a change in those assumptions

 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

as of the end of the period covered by this report the corporation carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the corporation’s management including the corporation’s chief executive officer ceo and executive vice president – finance and chief financial officer cfo of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to exchange act rules 13a15 and 15d15 in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives based upon that evaluation the ceo and the cfo concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report the corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the sec and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

  

additionally the ceo and cfo determined that there have been no changes to the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting 

  

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

the management of union pacific corporation and subsidiary companies the corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f the corporation’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the corporation’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 

  

all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

  

the corporation’s management assessed the effectiveness of the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 in making this assessment it used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control – integrated framework based on our assessment management believes that as of december 31 2006 the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 

  

the corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our assessment of the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting this report appears on page 73

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

  

union pacific corporation its directors and shareholders 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting that union pacific corporation and subsidiary companies the corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that the corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on the criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended december 31 2006 of the corporation and our report dated february 16 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the corporation’s adoption in 2006 of statement of financial accounting standard no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans

working capital – we currently have and historically have had a working capital deficit which is common in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity or financial stability we maintain adequate resources to meet our daily cash requirements and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

  

competition – we are subject to competition from other railroads motor carriers and barge operators our main rail competitor is burlington northern santa fe corporation its rail subsidiary bnsf railway company operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors in addition we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers motor carrier competition is particularly strong for five of our six commodity groups because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and gulf coast waterways barge competition can be particularly effective especially for grain and bulk commodities in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service while we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation or legislation releasing motor carriers from their size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

equipment suppliers – we depend on two key domestic suppliers of locomotives due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of this equipment high barriers to entry face potential new suppliers therefore if one 

  

of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives we could experience a significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations 

  

employees – approximately 87 of our 49747 fulltimeequivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions under the collective bargaining round that began on november 1 1999 all unions reached new labor agreements with the railroads in 2005 in january 2005 we began the next round of negotiations with the unions existing agreements remain in effect and will continue to remain in effect until new agreements are reached or the railway labor act’s procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential intervention are exhausted contract negotiations with the various unions generally take place over an extended period of time and we rarely experience work stoppages during negotiations the current agreements provide for periodic cost of living wage increases until new agreements are reached

 item 1a risk factors 

  

we must manage significant demand for our services on limited network capacity – due to continuing demand for rail service and capacity constraints we may experience network difficulties including congestion and reduced velocity which may compromise the level of service we provide to our customers this level of demand may compound the impact of weather and weatherrelated events on our operations and velocity we recently experienced varying degrees of disruptions congestion and reduced velocity due to a variety of factors including 

  

significant demand and weather events and the extensive maintenance and restoration program on the sprb line that is jointlyowned with bnsf sprb joint line the weather events affected both our operations and operations of certain of our customers although we have recovered from these events further network improvement will be driven by the ongoing redesign of our transportation plan to better manage traffic on our system and adding more capacity we cannot be sure that these measures will fully or adequately address any service shortcomings we also cannot be sure that we will not experience other difficulties related to network capacity dramatic and unplanned increases of demand for rail service in one or more of our commodity groups or other events that could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures – the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage environmental liability and other matters any material changes to litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving property damage personal injury or environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we are subject to significant governmental regulation – we are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal state and local authorities covering a variety of health safety labor environmental as discussed below and other matters our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us governments may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate without providing us with any recourse for any adverse effects on our business economic reregulation of the rail industry would negatively impact our ability to determine prices for rail services and reduce capital spending on our rail network resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity also some laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses permits and other authorizations and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so in addition one or more consolidations of class i railroads could lead to future reregulation of the rail industry 

  

we are required to transport hazardous materials – federal laws require railroads including uprr to transport hazardous materials any rail accident involving the release of hazardous materials could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury property damage and environmental penalties and remediation which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we are subject to significant environmental laws and regulations – our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waters handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and hazardous material or petroleum releases we generate and transport hazardous and nonhazardous waste in our operations and we did so in our former operations environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties leased properties and properties owned by third parties as well as to properties we currently own environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation we have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated or are strictly liable under these laws or regulations we could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures – severe weather conditions events and other natural phenomena including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods extreme temperatures and significant precipitation may cause business interruptions including line outages on our rail network that can adversely affect our entire rail network and result in increased costs increased liabilities and decreased revenues which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

rising fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our business – fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses diesel fuel prices are subject to dramatic fluctuations significant price increases may 

  

have a material adverse effect on our operating results additionally international political and economic circumstances affect fuel prices and supplies weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity if a fuel supply shortage were to arise from opec production curtailments a disruption of oil imports or other causes higher fuel prices could despite our fuel surcharge programs have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

the majority of our employees belong to labor unions and labor agreements strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations – we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions under the collective bargaining round that began on november 1 1999 all unions reached new labor agreements with the railroads in 2005 in january 2005 we began the next round of negotiations with the unions disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in among other things strikes work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers if unionized workers were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown or other employees were to become unionized we could experience a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could compromise our service reliability and significantly increase our costs for healthcare wages and other benefits which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

the availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations – changes in demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel particularly engineers and trainmen could negatively impact our ability to meet demand for rail service unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we face competition from other railroads and other transportation providers – we face competition from other railroads motor carriers and to a lesser extent ships barges and pipelines in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service while we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation or legislation releasing motor carriers from their size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect the competitive environment in which we operate 

  

we utilize capital markets – we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements including the issuance of commercial paper from time to time and the sale of certain of our receivables market instability or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to commercial paper and reduce our credit ratings below investment grade which would prohibit us from utilizing our sale of receivables program and significantly increase the cost of issuing debt 

  

we may be affected by general economic conditions – prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions affecting the producers and consumers of the commodities carried by us may have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we are dependent on two key domestic suppliers of locomotives – due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment high barriers to entry face potential new suppliers therefore if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives we could experience a significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations 

  

we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations – we rely on information technology in all aspects of our business if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if we are 

  

unable to implement new technology we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and liquidity additionally if we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment we could experience a service interruption safety failure or security breach or other operational difficulties which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we may be affected by acts of terrorism war or risk of war – our rail lines facilities and equipment including rail cars carrying hazardous materials could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks terrorist attacks or other similar events any government response thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in addition insurance premiums for some or all of our current coverages could increase dramatically or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future

results of operations 

  

operating revenue 

  

   

operating revenue includes commodity revenue and other revenue other revenue consists primarily of revenue earned by our subsidiaries revenue from our commuter rail operations and accessorial revenue which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by the railroad we recognize commodity revenue on a percentageofcompletion basis as freight moves from origin to destination we allocate commodity revenue between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred we recognize other revenue as service is performed or contractual obligations are met 

  

commodity revenue improved in all six business groups during 2005 with doubledigit growth in the agricultural industrial products and intermodal commodity groups fuel surcharges price increases and indexbased contract escalators which are formulas in our shipping contracts that correlate price adjustments to certain economic indexes all contributed to higher average revenue per car arc in 2005 our fuel surcharge programs generated 1 billion in commodity revenue which represents approximately 74 of the additional expense incurred above the base fuel price for our fuel surcharge programs currently 075 per gallon although volume grew 1 for the year the severe weather and maintenance and restoration on the sprb joint line constrained volume growth 

  

the commodity revenue increase in 2004 was driven by growth in the industrial products intermodal and chemical groups fuel surcharges price increases and indexbased contract escalators contributed to the increase in arc in 2004 our fuel surcharge programs generated 330 million in commodity revenue which represented 52 of the additional expense incurred above the base fuel price of 075 per gallon arc improved 3 to 1236 while revenue carloads increased 2 

  

subsidiary and accessorial revenue increased other revenue in 2005 mainly driven by higher volumes in addition we generated higher subsidiary revenue due to the acquisition of our joint venture partner’s interest in bay pacific financial llc bay pacific an intermodal equipment leasing entity passenger and subsidiary revenue increased other revenue in 2004 although accessorial revenue declined 

  

the following tables summarize the yearoveryear changes in commodity revenue revenue carloads and average revenue per car by commodity type 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

mexico business – each commodity group discussed above includes revenue from shipments to and from mexico which increased 15 to 11 billion in 2005 compared to 2004 revenue growth resulted primarily from price increases and fuel surcharges carloads were flat versus 2004 as fewer auto parts energy and intermodal shipments offset higher agricultural and industrial shipments 

  

in 2004 revenue grew 9 to 970 million resulting from increased volume in the industrial products intermodal chemical and automotive business groups particularly cement newsprint and wood fiber liquid and dry chemicals soda ash and automotive materials revenue generated from agricultural shipments also improved due to higher wheat exports and beer imports lower export shipments of corn and feed grains as well as reduced energy carloads partially offset the increases 

  

operating expenses 

  



  

   

salaries wages and employee benefits – several factors drove higher employment expenses in 2005 general wage and benefit inflation continued to increase expenses reflecting higher salaries and wages and the yearoveryear impact of higher healthcare and other benefits costs we also incurred higher expenses for management bonuses in 2005 as executive bonuses were not awarded for 2004 and bonuses for the professional workforce were significantly reduced a 3 increase in our workforce and higher demand during the year also contributed to the increases additionally labor expenses in the form of higher train crew costs and labor incurred for repair and cleanup activities increased due to the hurricanes in the third quarter and the west coast storm in the first quarter reduced severance and relocation costs increased network efficiency and reduced training expenses 

  

partially offset these increases transferring various support personnel to omaha nebraska resulted in higher severance and relocation costs in 2004 

  

the increase in 2004 also resulted from a number of factors including higher wages and training expenses associated with hiring additional trainmen increased crew costs due to slower network velocity inflation volumerelated expenses and severance and relocation costs because we did not award executive bonuses for 2004 lower performancebased compensation expense for management partially offset these increases lower protection costs also offset these increased expenses protection cost represents the differential payment when the wage earned for active employment is lower than an employee’s “protected” rate of pay the stb mandates protected rates for employees adversely affected by a merger and collective bargaining agreements with our labor unions also establish these rates finally a smaller nontransportation workforce yielded cost savings during the year 

  

fuel and utilities 

  

   

fuel and utilities include locomotive fuel utilities other than telephone and gasoline and other fuels higher diesel fuel prices which averaged 177 per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in 2005 compared to 122 per gallon in 2004 increased expenses by 740 million a 1 increase in gross tonmiles resulted in 8 million of additional expenses we offset 39 million of these increases with a 2 improvement in our consumption rate in 2005 versus 2004 the railroad had no fuel hedges in place during 2005 and has none in place for 2006 gasoline utilities and propane expenses increased 37 million in 2005 versus 2004 due to higher prices 

  

the increase in 2004 compared to 2003 was driven by higher diesel fuel prices which averaged 122 per gallon and 092 per gallon in 2004 and 2003 respectively including taxes and transportation costs and higher gallons consumed higher fuel prices contributed 416 million to the increase however we recovered approximately 52 of these costs through our fuel surcharge programs which were included in operating revenues the increase in gross tonmiles in 2004 drove consumption higher resulting in an additional 24 million in fuel expense for the year the railroad hedged approximately 9 of its fuel usage in 2004 which decreased fuel costs by 14 million gasoline utilities and propane expenses increased 13 million in 2004 due to higher prices 

  

equipment and other rents – equipment and other rents includes primarily rental expense the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies freight car intermodal and locomotive leases other specialty equipment leases and office and other rentals in 2005 the number of leased locomotives and freight cars increased resulting in additional lease expenses higher carloads also increased 2005 expenses improved carcycle times partially offset these increases reflecting increased network efficiency which lowered our shortterm freight car rental expense 

  

expenses increased in 2004 due to carload volume growth and longer car cycle times resulting in higher expenses for locomotive and car rentals higher locomotive expense included additional costs associated with leasing shortterm or surge locomotive power which is more costly than longterm locomotive leases and the increased leasing of new locomotives 

  

depreciation – the majority of depreciation relates to track structure including rail ties and other track material a higher depreciable asset base reflecting higher capital spending in recent years increased our depreciation expense in 2005 and 2004 

  

materials and supplies – materials used to maintain the railroad’s lines structures and equipment are the principal components of materials and supplies expense this expense item also includes small tools office supplies other materials and the costs of freight services to ship railroad supplies and materials during 2005 materials and supplies expense increased primarily due to locomotive and freight car maintenance we used more repair materials to maintain a larger fleet of locomotives including a growing number of units not covered by warranties additionally we incurred higher costs for car wheel sets traction motors and lube oil conversely we incurred lower freight charges for shipping railroad materials and stationary and office supplies 

  

we incurred higher expenses in 2004 due to increased use of locomotive repair materials required to maintain a larger fleet that includes older units not covered by warranties we also performed more freight car repairs incurred higher materials costs and experienced increased freight charges for shipment of railroad material 

  

casualty costs – personal injury expense freight and property damage insurance and environmental costs are the primary components of casualty costs casualty costs in 2005 were lower than the previous year primarily due to higher expenses incurred in 2004 for an asbestos charge a costly derailment near san antonio and a large jury verdict – affirmed in 2004 – for a 1998 crossing accident lower freight and property damage expense and lower costs for destruction of foreign or leased equipment also reduced casualty costs conversely we incurred higher insurance costs and increased costs for thirdparty personal injuries related to longterm environmental exposures 

  

in 2004 costs rose due to the asbestos charge of 247 million pretax a costly derailment near san antonio and a large jury verdict – affirmed in 2004 – for a 1998 crossing accident partially offsetting these increases were lower insurance expenses and reduced personal injury expense which resulted from lower than anticipated settlement costs and fewer employee injuries in 2004 than previously assumed 

  

purchased services and other costs – purchased services and other costs include the costs of services purchased from outside contractors state and local taxes net costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other railroads transportation and lodging for train crew employees trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers leased automobile maintenance expenses telephone and cellular phone expense employee travel expense and computer and other general expenses expenses decreased in 2005 versus 2004 because we incurred higher relocation costs associated with moving support personnel to omaha nebraska during 2004 in 2005 we experienced higher volumerelated costs for freight car and locomotive contract maintenance and crew transportation and lodging although our intermodal carloadings increased over 4 in 2005 costs for trucking services provided by intermodal carriers remained flat as we substantially reduced expenses associated with network inefficiencies higher diesel fuel prices increased sales and use taxes in 2005 which resulted in higher state and local taxes other contract services increased in 2005 the 2005 january west coast storm and hurricanes katrina and rita also contributed to higher expenses in 2005 net of insurance reimbursements received 

  

in 2004 higher locomotive contract maintenance services state and local taxes and relocation costs drove expenses higher in addition we incurred increased trucking expenses for intermodal carriers and crew transportation costs due to slower network velocity and additional volume 

  

nonoperating items 

  

   

other income – other income increased in 2005 largely as a result of higher gains from real estate sales partially offset by higher expenses due to rising interest rates associated with our sale of receivables program in addition other income in 2004 included income recognized from the sale of a technology subsidiary’s assets 

  

other income improved in 2004 due to higher costs in 2003 associated with premium payments for early retirement of 15 billion of convertible preferred securities cps and income recognized in 2004 from the sale of assets of a technology subsidiary these were partially offset by lower gains from real estate sales in 2004 compared to 2003 

  

interest expense – lower interest expense in 2005 and 2004 was primarily due to declining weightedaverage debt levels of 78 billion 81 billion and 89 billion in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively our effective interest rate was 65 in both 2005 and 2004 compared to 64 in 2003 

  

income taxes – income taxes were greater in 2005 due to higher 2005 pretax income which was partially offset by a previously reported reduction in income tax expense in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2005 we reported that the corporation had undertaken an analysis of the impact that final settlements of tax liabilities for pre1995 tax years with the internal revenue service irs had on previously recorded estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities the completed analysis of the final settlements for pre1995 tax years along with irs examination reports for tax years 1995 through 2002 were considered among other things in a review and reevaluation of the corporation’s estimated deferred tax assets and liabilities as of september 30 2005 resulting in an income tax expense reduction of 118 million in 2005 

  

income tax expense decreased in 2004 driven by lower pretax income a reduction in the deferred state income tax liability primarily attributable to relocating support operations to omaha nebraska state income tax credits earned in connection with the new headquarters building in omaha and an increase in foreign tax credits resulting from the passage of the american jobs creation act of 2004 

  

discontinued operations 

  

on november 5 2003 we completed the sale of our entire trucking interest in 2003 revenue and income from discontinued operations were 12 billion and 255 million respectively income from discontinued operations in 2003 included the net gain from the sale of our trucking interest of 211 million including an income tax benefit of 126 million 

  

operating and financial statistics 

  

railroad performance measures 

  

we report key railroad performance measures weekly to the american association of railroads including carloads average daily inventory of rail cars on our system average train speed and average terminal dwell time this operating data is available on our website at wwwupcominvestorsreportsindexshtml 

  

operating statistics 

  

   

average train speed – average train speed is calculated by dividing train miles by hours operated on our main lines between terminals in 2005 the west coast storm disruptions on the sprb joint line business interruptions caused by hurricane rita and the kansas washouts in october hampered efforts to improve our average train speed in 2004 unprecedented demand for our services and crew and locomotive shortages negatively impacted operational efficiency and average train speed 

  

average terminal dwell time – average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our terminals lower average terminal dwell time is favorable the 6 improvement in dwell time in 2005 resulted from strategic network management initiatives and efforts to more timely deliver rail cars to our interchange partners and customers record demand levels and operational challenges experienced in 2004 affected network performance including average terminal dwell time 

  

gross and revenue tonmiles – gross tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded or empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled revenue tonmiles are based on tariff miles and do not include the weight of freight cars in 2005 gross and revenue tonmiles grew 1 and 05 in relation to a 1 increase of carloadings gross and revenue tonmiles increased 2 and 3 respectively in 2004 with 2 growth of carloadings during the same period the increase in gross and revenue tonmiles was also positively impacted by volume growth experienced in the higher density commodity groups of industrial products and chemicals combined with a minimal increase in automotive carloads which is a lower density commodity 

  

average fulltime equivalent employees – the 2005 increase includes the addition of employees needed to complete increased track repair and replacement programs more train crew personnel both to handle the increased demand and to improve service and the hiring of operations management personnel including an expanded management training program the 2004 average number of fulltime equivalent employees increased as we added train crew personnel who were hired to handle increased customer demand and improve service these additions were partially offset by increased productivity in the nontransportation functions employee attrition and fewer employees at our technology subsidiaries 

  

other financial statistics 

  

   

debt to capitallease adjusted debt to capital – debt to capital is computed by dividing total debt by total debt plus equity lease adjusted debt to capital is derived by dividing total debt plus the net present value of operating leases by total debt plus equity plus the net present value of operating leases we believe these measures are important in managing our capital structure to allow efficient access to the debt market while minimizing our cost of capital in 2005 our debt to capital ratio improved due to a 715 million reduction in our debt level and an increase in equity resulting from earnings our lease adjusted debt to capital improved to a lesser extent due to an increase in the present value of operating leases which were approximately 32 billion and 23 billion at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively using a discount rate of 8 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

as of december 31 2005 our principal sources of liquidity included cash cash equivalents the sale of receivables and our revolving credit facilities as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets we had 2 billion of credit facilities available of which there were no borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2005 the sale of receivables program is subject to certain requirements including the maintenance of an investment grade bond rating if our bond rating were to deteriorate it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the 

  

program was 600 million as of december 31 2005 access to commercial paper is dependent on market conditions deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to utilize commercial paper as a source of liquidity liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability 

  

at december 31 2005 and 2004 we had a working capital deficit of 1059 million and 226 million respectively a working capital deficit is common in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity we maintain adequate resources to meet our daily cash requirements and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

  

financial condition 

  

   

cash provided by operating activities – higher income lower management incentive payments in 2005 executive bonuses which would have been paid to individuals in 2005 were not awarded based on company performance in 2004 and bonuses for the professional workforce were significantly reduced and working capital performance generated higher cash from operating activities in 2005 a voluntary pension contribution of 100 million in 2004 also augmented the positive yearoveryear variance this improvement was partially offset by cash received in 2004 for income tax refunds cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2004 driven by lower income from continuing operations the pension contribution and cash from discontinued operations recognized in 2003 which were partially offset by working capital performance 

  

cash used in investing activities – increased capital spending partially offset by higher proceeds from asset sales increased the amount of cash used in investing activities in 2005 the comparative increase in 2004 primarily resulted from the beneficial impact of the 620 million received in 2003 for the sale of our trucking interest which reduced cash used in investing activities in 2003 the permanent financing of locomotives and freight cars under longterm operating leases as referenced in the operating lease activities section in this item 7 had no impact on investing cash flows during the period as all financings were completed in 2005 

  

cash used in financing activities – the increase in cash used in financing activities results from no cash inflows from the issuance of debt in 2005 compared to 745 million in 2004 and higher debt repayments 699 million in 2005 compared to 588 million in 2004 partially offset by higher net proceeds from equity compensation plans 262 million in 2005 compared to 80 million in 2004 the decrease in 2004 resulted from lower debt repayments of 588 million in 2004 compared to 21 billion in 2003 including 15 billion of cps partially offset by a decrease in net proceeds from equity compensation plans 80 million in 2004 compared to 216 million in 2003 and higher dividend payments 310 million in 2004 compared to 234 million in 2003 due to the increase of our dividend rate from 099 per share in 2003 to 120 per share in 2004 

  

the table below details cash capital expenditures for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 including noncash capital lease financings of 188 million in 2003 there were no noncash capital lease financings in 2005 or 2004 

  

   

in 2006 we expect our cash capital expenditures to be approximately 22 billion additionally we expect to enter into longterm operating leases for equipment with a net present value of approximately 500 million these expenditures will be used to maintain track and structures continue capacity expansions on our main lines in constrained corridors remove bottlenecks upgrade and augment equipment to better meet customer needs build and improve facilities and terminals and develop and implement new technologies we expect to fund our 2006 cash capital expenditures through cash generated from operations the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties and cash on hand at december 31 2005 we expect that these sources will continue to provide sufficient funds to meet our expected capital requirements for 2006 

  

for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 29 21 and 32 respectively the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis earnings represent income from continuing operations less equity earnings net of distributions plus fixed charges and income taxes fixed charges represent interest charges amortization of debt discount and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges 

  

financing activities 

  

credit facilities – on december 31 2005 we had 2 billion in revolving credit facilities available including 1 billion under a fiveyear facility expiring in march 2010 and 1 billion under a fiveyear facility expiring in march 2009 collectively the “facilities” the facilities are designated for general corporate purposes and support the issuance of commercial paper neither of the facilities were drawn as of december 31 2005 the fiveyear facility expiring in march 2010 replaced a 1 billion 364day revolving credit facility that expired in march 2005 while the fiveyear facility expiring in march 2009 was put in place in 2004 to replace a fiveyear revolving credit facility that was due to expire in march 2005 commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facilities are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investmentgrade borrowers these facilities allow for borrowings at floating london interbank offered rates liborbased rates plus a spread depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings the facilities require the maintenance of a minimum net worth and a debt to net worth coverage ratio at december 31 2005 we were in compliance with these covenants the facilities do not include any other financial restrictions credit rating triggers other than ratingdependent pricing or any other provision that could require the posting of collateral in addition to our revolving credit facilities we also had 150 million in uncommitted lines of credit that were unused at december 31 2005 we established two 75 million uncommitted lines of credit in may and july 2005 which will expire in may and july 2006 respectively 

  

at december 31 2004 approximately 440 million of shortterm borrowings that we intended to refinance were reclassified as longterm debt this reclassification reflected our ability and intent to refinance these shortterm borrowings and current maturities of longterm debt on a longterm basis at december 31 2005 we did not reclassify any shortterm debt to a longterm basis 

  

dividend restrictions – we are subject to certain restrictions related to the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders due to minimum net worth requirements under our credit facilities retained earnings available for 

  

dividends increased to 62 billion at december 31 2005 from 52 billion at december 31 2004 we do not expect that these restrictions will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

shelf registration statement – under a current shelf registration statement we may issue any combination of debt securities preferred stock common stock or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings at december 31 2005 we had 500 million remaining for issuance under the current shelf registration statement we have no immediate plans to issue any securities however we routinely consider and evaluate opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under this shelf registration and therefore we may issue debt securities at any time 

  

operating lease activities 

  

as of december 31 2005 our contractual obligations for operating leases totaled approximately 49 billion discounted at 8 the present value of this obligation was approximately 32 billion the railroad entered into lease arrangements during 2005 to finance its new equipment acquisition program in 2005 the railroad as lessee entered into longterm operating lease arrangements covering 317 locomotives and approximately 2900 freight cars the lessors under these lease arrangements purchased the locomotives and freight cars from the corporation through various financing transactions that totaled approximately 838 million with a present value of 690 million these new lease arrangements provide for minimum total rental payments of approximately 12 billion which are reflected in the contractual obligations table as of december 31 2005 

  

the lessors financed the purchase of the locomotives and freight cars in part by the issuance of equipment notes that are nonrecourse to the railroad and are secured by an assignment of the underlying leases and a security interest in the equipment neither the railroad nor upc guarantees payment of the equipment notes the railroad’s obligations to make operating lease payments under the leases are recourse obligations and are not recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position 

  

the railroad has certain renewal and purchase options with respect to the locomotives and freight cars if the railroad elects not to exercise any such options the equipment will be returned to the lessors at the end of the lease term 

  

on july 8 2005 the railroad completed the acquisition of its partner’s interest in bay pacific financial llc a joint venture established to assist in the acquisition of containers and chassis for use by the railroad in intermodal service for a purchase price of 51 million as a result of the acquisition the railroad owns 100 of the joint venture total minimum rental payments for operating leases acquired in the acquisition were 202 million at the time of acquisition 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements contractual obligations and commitments 

  

as described in the notes to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 and as referenced in the tables below we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition however based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments including material sources of offbalance sheet and structured finance arrangements there is no known trend demand commitment event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition the commercial obligations financings and commitments made by us are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations particularly within the transportation industry 

  

the following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of december 31 2005 

  

   

      

   

      

sale of receivables – the railroad transfers most of its accounts receivable to union pacific receivables inc upri a bankruptcyremote subsidiary as part of a sale of receivables facility upri sells without recourse on a 364day revolving basis an undivided interest in such accounts receivable to investors the total capacity to sell undivided interests to investors under the facility was 600 million at december 31 2005 the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the facility was 600 million and 590 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors is not included in our consolidated financial statements the value of the undivided interest held by investors was supported by 1226 million and 1089 million of accounts receivable held by upri at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively at december 31 2005 and 2004 the value of the interest retained by upri was 626 million and 499 million respectively this retained interest is included in accounts receivable in our consolidated financial statements the interest sold to investors is sold at carrying value which approximates fair value and there is no gain or loss recognized from the transaction 

  

the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors could fluctuate based upon the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks including default and 

  

dilution if default or dilution percentages were to increase one percentage point the amount of eligible receivables would decrease by 6 million should our credit rating fall below investment grade the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would be reduced and in certain cases the investors would have the right to discontinue the facility 

  

the railroad services the sold receivables however the railroad does not recognize any servicing asset or liability as the servicing fees adequately compensate the railroad for its responsibilities the railroad collected approximately 134 billion and 122 billion during the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively upri used certain of these proceeds to purchase new receivables under the facility 

  

the costs of the sale of receivables program are included in other income and were 23 million 11 million and 10 million for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the costs include interest program fees paid to banks commercial paper issuing costs and fees for unused commitment availability 

  

the investors have no recourse to the railroad’s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims creditors of the railroad have no recourse to the assets of upri on august 11 2005 the sale of receivables program was renewed for an additional 364day period without any significant changes in terms 

  

guarantees – at december 31 2005 we were contingently liable for 486 million in guarantees we recorded a liability of 7 million for the fair value of these obligations as of december 31 2005 we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business and they include guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building equipment financings and affiliated operations the final guarantee expires in 2022 we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

other matters 

  

inflation – the cumulative effect of long periods of inflation significantly increases asset replacement costs for capitalintensive companies as a result assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels depreciation charges on an inflationadjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 

  

derivative financial instruments – we use derivative financial instruments in limited instances for other than trading purposes to manage risk related to changes in fuel prices and to achieve our interest rate objectives we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged both at inception and throughout the hedged period we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items as well as our riskmanagement objectives strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness we may use swaps collars futures andor forward contracts to mitigate the downside risk of adverse price movements and to hedge the exposure to variable cash flows the use of these instruments also limits future benefits from favorable movements the purpose of these programs is to protect our operating margins and overall profitability from adverse fuel price changes or interest rate fluctuations 

  

market and credit risk – we address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item credit risk related to derivative financial instruments which is minimal is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements at december 31 2005 and 2004 we were not required to provide collateral nor had we received collateral relating to our hedging activities 

  

in addition we enter into secured financings in which the debtor pledges collateral the nature of the financing and the credit risk of the debtor determine the collateral these arrangements generally prohibit us from selling or repledging the collateral unless the debtor defaults 

  

determination of fair value – we determined the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions at december 31 2005 and 2004 based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or developed based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the applicable us treasury rate libor or swap spread 

  

sensitivity analyses – the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 

  

interest rate fair value hedges – we manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period we generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings we employ derivatives as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix in addition we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixedrate debt securities 

  

at december 31 2005 and 2004 we had variablerate debt representing approximately 10 and 9 respectively of our total debt if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2006 than our december 31 2005 variable rate which was approximately 7 our interest expense would increase by approximately 7 million if variable interest rates averaged one percentage point higher in 2005 than our december 31 2004 variable rate which was approximately 5 our interest expense would have increased by approximately 8 million these amounts were determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the balances of our variablerate debt at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt’s fair value attributable to the changes in the benchmark interest rate libor we accounted for the swaps as fair value hedges using the shortcut method pursuant to fasb statement no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities therefore we did not record any ineffectiveness within our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2005 and 2004 we had interest rate swaps hedging debt of 750 million 

  

market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2005 and amounts to approximately 535 million at december 31 2005 market risk resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2004 amounted to approximately 599 million at december 31 2004 we estimated the fair values of our fixedrate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 

  

interest rate cash flow hedges – we report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item affects earnings 

  

in 2004 we entered into treasury lock transactions which are accounted for as cash flow hedges these treasury lock transactions resulted in a payment of 11 million that is being amortized on a straightline basis over 10 years ending september 30 2014 the unamortized portion of the payment is recorded as a 6 million aftertax reduction to common shareholders’ equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss at december 31 2005 as of december 31 2005 and 2004 we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding 

  

fuel cash flow hedges – fuel costs are a significant portion of our total operating expenses in 2005 and 2004 our primary means of mitigating the impact of adverse fuel price changes was our fuel surcharge programs however we may use swaps collars futures andor forward contracts to further mitigate the impact of adverse fuel price changes we hedged 120 million gallons of fuel during 2004 using collars with average cap floor and ceiling prices of 074 064 and 086 per gallon respectively at december 31 2004 there were no fuel hedges outstanding and we did not have any fuel hedges in place during 2005 

  

accounting pronouncements – in december 2004 the fasb issued statement no 123r  sharebased payment the statement requires that we recognize compensation expense equal to the fair value of stock options or other sharebased payments starting january 1 2006 we adopted the statement on a modified prospective basis using the blackscholes optionpricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options we expect that the incremental fullyear compensation expense in 2006 related to the adoption of the statement will be approximately 13 million for new awards granted after january 1 2006 and an additional 2 million for the unvested portion of awards granted in prior years the expense for awards granted after implementation of the statement will be based upon their grantdate fair value the expense for those awards will be based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest that estimate will be revised if subsequent information indicates that the actual number of awards to vest will differ from the estimate the estimate does not materially impact our calculation of compensation expense 

  

in march 2005 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 47 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations – an interpretation of fasb statement no 143 fin 47 this interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligations as used in fasb statement no 143 refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing or method of settlement or both are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity an entity must recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated we assessed the impact of the interpretation on our financial statements determined that we have a legal obligation to properly dispose of asbestoscontaining materials and recorded a 5 million liability at december 31 2005 for the fair value of this obligation 

  

in may 2005 the fasb issued fas 154 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 20 and fasb statement no 3 this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of changes in accounting principle unless it is impracticable to determine either the periodspecific effects or the cumulative effect of the change it carries forward without change the previous guidance for reporting the correction of an error and a change in accounting estimate fas 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 

  

in july 2005 the fasb issued an exposure draft accounting for uncertain tax positions an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  as drafted the interpretation would require companies to recognize the best estimate of the impact of a tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained during a tax audit however in november 2005 the fasb voted to replace the probable threshold with a morelikelythannot criterion when determining if the impact of a tax position should be recorded the fasb expects to issue a final interpretation in the first quarter of 2006 when it is available we will review the final interpretation to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in september 2005 the fasb issued an exposure draft earnings per share an amendment of fasb statement no 128  the draft clarifies guidance for the treasury stock method contracts that may be settled in cash or shares and contingently issuable shares the fasb expects to issue a final statement in the first quarter of 2006 we are currently reviewing this proposed exposure draft to determine the impact it may have on our calculation of earnings per share 

  

in december 2005 the fasb deliberated issues relating to the limitedscope first phase of its project to reconsider the accounting for postretirement benefits including pensions the fasb decided that the objectives and scope of this phase include among other items recognizing the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or a liability in the statement of financial position the fasb expects to issue an exposure draft for the initial phase in the first quarter of 2006 in the second multiyear phase of the project the fasb expects to comprehensively consider a variety of issues related to the accounting for postretirement benefits including expense recognition obligation measurement and whether postretirement benefit trusts should be consolidated by the plan sponsor we will review the proposed standards when they are available to determine the impact they may have on our consolidated financial statements 

  

commitments and contingencies – various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries we are also subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations pursuant to which we are currently participating in the investigation and remediation of various sites we do not expect that any known lawsuits claims environmental costs commitments contingent liabilities or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity after taking into account liabilities previously recorded for these matters 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in the notes to the financial statements and supplementary data item 8 these critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 

  

asbestos – we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees allege exposure to asbestos additionally we have received claims for asbestos exposure that have not been litigated a liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted asbestosrelated claims through 2034 has been estimated and recorded during 2004 we engaged a thirdparty with extensive experience in estimating resolution costs for asbestosrelated claims to assist us in assessing our potential liability the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions 

  

   

   

   

   

at december 31 2005 and 2004 311 million and 324 million respectively was classified as liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial position of which 16 million and 17 million respectively was classified as current accrued casualty costs approximately 16 of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 84 related to unasserted claims these claims are expected to be paid out over the next 29 years we have insurance coverage for a portion of the costs incurred to resolve asbestosrelated claims and we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries 

  

our asbestosrelated claims activity was as follows 

  

   

we believe that our liability for asbestosrelated claims and the estimated insurance recoveries reflect reasonable and probable estimates the amounts recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts however future events such as the number of new claims to be filed each year average settlement costs and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts estimates may also vary due to changes in the litigation environment federal and state law governing compensation of asbestos claimants and the level of payments made to claimants by other defendants 

  

additionally we have a legal obligation to properly dispose of asbestoscontaining materials the estimated fair value of this obligation is 5 million at december 31 2005 which is recorded as a liability on the consolidated statements of financial position pursuant to fin 47  

  

environmental – we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations we identified 370 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements this includes 43 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government 23 of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 

  

when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in the conduct of our business we and our consultants perform environmental assessments on the property we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and we can reasonably estimate such costs we do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable 

  

environmental expenses for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 were 45 million 46 million and 26 million respectively as of december 31 2005 and 2004 we had a liability of 213 million and 201 million respectively accrued for future environmental costs of which 46 million and 50 million respectively were recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties cost estimates are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and existing technology laws and regulations the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved sitespecific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

personal injury – the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year we use thirdparty actuaries to assist us with measuring the expense and liability including unasserted claims the federal employers’ liability act fela governs compensation for workrelated accidents under fela damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or outofcourt settlements we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work annual expenses for personal injuryrelated events were 247 million in 2005 288 million in 2004 and 250 million in 2003 as of december 31 2005 and 2004 we had accrued liabilities of 619 million and 639 million for future personal injury costs respectively of which 274 million was recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs in both years estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation 

  

our personal injury claims activity was as follows 

  

   

depreciation – the railroad industry is capital intensive properties are carried at cost provisions for depreciation are computed principally on the straightline method based on estimated service lives of depreciable property the lives are calculated using a separate composite annual percentage rate for each depreciable property group based on the results of a depreciation study we are required to submit a report on depreciation studies and proposed depreciation rates every three years for equipment property and every six years for road property to the stb for review and approval the cost net of salvage of depreciable railroad property retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized a gain or loss is recognized in other income for all other property upon disposition because the gain or loss is not part of rail operations the cost of internally developed software is capitalized and amortized over a fiveyear period an obsolescence review of capitalized software is performed on a periodic basis 

  

capital spending in recent years has increased the total value of our depreciable assets cash capital spending totaled 22 billion for the year ended december 31 2005 in 2003 we implemented depreciation studies approved by the stb resulting in lower depreciation expense of 50 million for the year ended december 31 2003 due to a reduction in depreciation rates for certain track assets effective january 1 2003 partially offset by increased rates for locomotives and other assets effective july 1 2003 for the year ended december 31 2005 depreciation expense was 12 billion various methods are used to estimate useful lives for each group of depreciable property due to the capital intensive nature of the business and the large base of depreciable assets variances to those estimates could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately 40 million if the estimated useful lives of all assets to be depreciated were decreased by one year annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately 43 million 

  

income taxes – as required under financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes  we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns these expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated future tax law changes such as a change in the corporate tax rate could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations for example a 1 increase in the federal income tax rate would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately 240 million 

  

when appropriate we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized based in part on management’s judgments regarding the best available evidence about future events based on that analysis we have recorded a valuation allowance of 5 million and 11 million against certain deferred tax assets as of december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

insurance subsidiaries – we have two consolidated whollyowned subsidiaries that provide insurance coverage for certain risks including physical loss or property damage and certain other claims that are subject to reinsurance at december 31 2005 current accounts receivable and current accrued casualty costs included 65 million for reinsurance receivables and reinsured liability respectively held by one of our insurance subsidiaries 

  

related to losses sustained during the west coast storm in january 2005 this amount may change in the future as facts and circumstances surrounding the claim and the reinsurance are finalized and settled we collected a partial recovery of our claim from reinsurance of 25 million during the fourth quarter of 2005 

  

pension and other postretirement benefits – we use thirdparty actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and defined contribution medical and life insurance benefits opeb to eligible employees in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make several assumptions the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets for other postretirement benefits the critical assumptions are the discount rate and healthcare cost trend rate 

  

we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually and selected assumptions are based on the following factors 

  

   

   

   

the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure pension and opeb expense for 2005 and the estimated impact on 2005 pension and opeb expense relative to a change in those assumptions

 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

as of the end of the period covered by this report the corporation carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the corporation’s management including the corporation’s chief executive officer ceo and executive vice president – finance and chief financial officer cfo of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to exchange act rules 13a15 and 15d15 in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives based upon that evaluation the ceo and the cfo concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report the corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the sec and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

  

additionally the ceo and cfo determined that there have been no significant changes to the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting 

  

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

the management of union pacific corporation and subsidiary companies the corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f the corporation’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the corporation’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 

  

all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

  

the corporation’s management assessed the effectiveness of the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 in making this assessment it used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control – integrated framework based on our assessment management believes that as of december 31 2005 the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 

  

the corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our assessment of the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting this report appears on page 75

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

  

union pacific corporation its directors and shareholders 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting that union pacific corporation and subsidiary companies the corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that the corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on the criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended december 31 2005 of the corporation and our report dated february 17 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule

continuing operations – uprr is a class i railroad that operates in the united states we have approximately 33000 route miles linking pacific coast and gulf coast ports with the midwest and eastern united states gateways and providing several northsouth corridors to key mexican gateways we serve the western twothirds of the country and maintain coordinated schedules with other rail carriers for the handling of freight to and from the atlantic coast the pacific coast the southeast the southwest canada and mexico export and import traffic is moved through gulf coast and pacific coast ports and across the mexican and canadian borders railroad commodity revenue totaled 117 billion in 2004 and is comprised of the following six commodity groups 

  

agricultural – the transportation of agricultural products including whole grains for animal and human consumption and commodities produced from these grains food and beverage products and sweeteners provided 14 of the railroad’s 2004 commodity revenue with access to most major grain markets the railroad provides a critical link between the midwest and western producing areas and the primary pacific northwest pnw and gulf ports as well as mexico uprr also serves significant domestic markets including grain processors and feeders and ethanol producers in the midwest west south and rocky mountain states unit trains of grain efficiently shuttle between producers and export terminals or domestic markets primary food commodities consist of a variety of fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables dairy products and beverages that are moved to major us population centers for consumption express lane our premium and perishables service that moves fruits and vegetables from the pnw and california to destinations in the east continues to focus on drawing market share from the trucking industry frozen meat and poultry are also transported to the west coast ports for export while beverages are imported into the us from mexico sweeteners are primarily shorthaul sugar beet movements from the fields to the refineries both of which are located in idaho 

  

automotive – uprr is the largest automotive carrier west of the mississippi river serving seven vehicle assembly plants and distributing imported vehicles from six west coast ports and houston the railroad serves 42 vehicle distribution centers that deliver vehicles to all major western us cities these centers serve as rail cartotruck haul away operations for major domestic and international automotive manufacturers in addition to transporting finished vehicles uprr currently provides expedited handling of automobile materials in both boxcars and containers to several assembly plants mexico continues to be an integral part of our automotive business the railroad carries automobile materials bound for assembly plants in mexico the us and canada to and from mexican interchanges and transports finished vehicles from manufacturing facilities in mexico in 2004 transportation of finished vehicles and automobile materials accounted for 11 of the railroad’s total commodity revenue 

  

chemicals – the transportation of chemicals provided 15 of uprr’s 2004 commodity revenue the railroad’s franchise enables it to serve the large chemical producing areas along the gulf coast as well as the rocky mountain region more than twothirds of the chemicals business consists of liquid and dry chemicals plastics and liquid petroleum products in addition to transporting plastics customers also leverage uprr’s industry leading storageintransit yards for intermediate storage of plastic resins soda ash shipments originate in southwestern wyoming and california and are consumed primarily in glass producing markets in the east the west and abroad fertilizer movements originate primarily in the gulf coast region as well as the west and canada bound for major agricultural endusers in the midwest and the western us 

  

energy – coal transportation accounted for 20 of uprr’s 2004 commodity revenue the railroad’s geographic footprint positions it to transport coal destined for utilities and industrial facilities in 27 states as well as to the gulf and railbargeship facilities on the mississippi and ohio rivers and the great lakes uprr serves mines located in the southern powder river basin of wyoming in addition to colorado utah southern wyoming and southern illinois southern powder river basin coal represents the largest growth segment of the market as utilities continue to favor its low cost and lowsulfur content in addition uprr continues to penetrate markets in the east as electricity generation continues to grow in the face of declining eastern coal production highbtu lowsulfur coal from colorado and utah is also transported for export to mexico 

  

industrial products – the industrial products group includes a broad range of commodities from bulk products like stone cement minerals waste and scrap to highervalue shipments like lumber paper government and consumer goods bulk commodities often move in unit train service from origin to a distribution facility in major metropolitan areas other commodities move in manifest trains and rely on the railroad’s extensive network to move between thousands of shippers and customers across north america in 2004 the transportation of industrial products provided 21 of the railroad’s total commodity revenue 

  

intermodal – uprr’s intermodal business which represents 19 of the railroad’s 2004 commodity revenues is classified as international domestic or premium shipments international business consists of international container traffic for steamship customers it arrives at west coast ports for destinations throughout the united states domestic business includes domestic container and trailer traffic handled by intermodal marketing companies primarily shipper agents and consolidators and truckload carriers lessthantruckload and package carriers with timesensitive business requirements account for the majority of our premium service service performance and reliability are important in driving intermodal business growth 

  

working capital – we currently have and historically have had a working capital deficit which is not uncommon in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity or financial stability we maintain adequate resources to meet our daily cash requirements and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

  

competition – we are subject to competition from other railroads motor carriers and barge operators our main rail competitor is burlington northern santa fe corporation its rail subsidiary bnsf railway company operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors in addition we operate in corridors served by other competing railroads and by motor carriers motor carrier competition is particularly strong with respect to five of our six commodity groups excluding energy due to shorter delivery times offered by such carriers because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and gulf coast waterways barge competition can be particularly pronounced especially for grain and bulk commodities competition can pressure both transit time requirements and pricing as well as place a greater emphasis on the quality and reliability of the service provided while we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation in the locations in which we operate or legislation granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

equipment suppliers – we are dependent on two key domestic suppliers of locomotives due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of this equipment and its production there are high barriers of entry to potential new suppliers therefore if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives we could experience a significant cost increase and the potential for reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations 

  

employees – approximately 87 of our more than 48000 fulltime equivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions under the collective bargaining round that began on november 1 1999 11 of the 14 unions reached new labor agreements with the railroads we are currently negotiating new agreements with the remaining three unions existing agreements remain in effect and will continue to remain in effect until new agreements are reached or the railway labor act’s procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential intervention are exhausted the current agreements provide for periodic wage increases until new agreements are reached 

  

on november 1 2004 notices for the next round of negotiations were sent to all 14 unions by the national railway labor conference on behalf of uprr and other carriers in the conference these legal notices state our desire to modify the current collective bargaining agreements contract negotiations with the various unions usually take place over an extended period of time and generally have not resulted in work stoppages 

  

discontinued operations – in november 2003 we completed the sale of our entire trucking interest and as a result the operations of otc and motor cargo are included in discontinued operations see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements item 8 

  

governmental and environmental regulation 

  

governmental regulation – our operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local regulations generally applicable to all businesses see also the discussion of certain regulatory proceedings in legal proceedings item 3 

  

the operations of the railroad are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board stb of the united states department of transportation dot and other federal and state agencies the operations of the railroad are also subject to the regulations of the federal railroad administration fra of the dot the stb has jurisdiction over rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic freight car compensation transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines and acquisition of control of rail common carriers 

  

the dot and the occupational safety and health administration along with other federal agencies have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety movement of hazardous materials movement and disposal of hazardous waste emissions requirements and equipment standards various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law 

  

on february 14 2005 we received a civil investigative demand cid from the antitrust division of the department of justice doj the cid seeks information concerning pricing activities for the transportation of coal carried by uprr from the southern powder river basin during 2004 several coal shippers’ organizations questioned the appropriateness of our pricing practices for southern powder river basin coal transportation the railroad initiated a meeting with the doj in early december in order to explain those practices and the manner in which price information is distributed to customers it is not uncommon for the doj to issue cids to gather additional facts and information to facilitate its investigatory functions issuance of a cid does not indicate any conclusion with respect to the legality of our coal pricing activities we are confident that the doj’s investigation will confirm that our activities are lawful and we intend to cooperate with the doj’s request for information 

  

environmental regulation – in addition to the regulations governing the transportation of hazardous materials we are subject to extensive federal and state environmental statutes and regulations pertaining to public health and the environment the statutes and regulations are administered and monitored by the environmental protection agency epa and by various state environmental agencies the laws primarily affecting our operations are the resource conservation and recovery act of 1976 regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1976 regulating the cleanup of contaminated properties the clean air act regulating air emissions and the clean water act regulating waste water discharges 

  

information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies – environmental item 7 

  




 risk factors 

  

we face competition from other railroads and other transportation providers – we are subject to competition from other railroads which operate parallel routes in many of our traffic corridors in addition to motor carriers and to a lesser extent ships barges and pipelines competition can pressure both transit time requirements and pricing as well as place a greater emphasis on the quality and reliability of the service provided while we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in which we operate or legislation granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we have experienced service difficulties which may continue – due to unprecedented demand for rail service a shortage of train personnel and locomotives and capacity constraints we have experienced network difficulties including congestion and reduced velocity on our system which have compromised the level of service we provide to our customers in a competitive environment although we have taken steps to correct these difficulties including hiring and training employees for train service acquiring equipment and the ongoing redesign of our transportation plan to better manage traffic on our system we cannot be sure that these measures will fully or adequately address our service difficulties we also cannot be sure that we will not experience other difficulties related to network capacity dramatic and unplanned increases of demand for rail service in one or more of our commodity groups or other events that could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we are subject to significant governmental regulation – we are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal state and local authorities covering a variety of health safety labor environmental as discussed below and other matters our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us governments may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate without providing us with any recourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on our business economic reregulation of the rail industry would negatively impact our ability to determine prices for rail services and reduce capital spending on our rail network resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity also some laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses permits and other authorizations and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in addition one or more consolidations of class i railroads could lead to future reregulation of the rail industry 

  

rising fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our business – fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses diesel fuel prices are subject to dramatic fluctuations significant price increases may have a material adverse effect on our operating results additionally fuel prices and supplies are affected by international political and economic circumstances if a fuel supply shortage were to arise from opec production curtailments a disruption of oil imports or otherwise higher fuel prices could despite our fuel surcharge programs materially affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity 

  

we are subject to significant environmental laws and regulations – our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waters handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases we generate and transport hazardous and nonhazardous waste in our current operations and we did so in our former operations environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties leased properties and properties owned by third parties as well as to properties currently owned and used by us environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation we have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated or are strictly liable under these laws or regulations although we have appropriately recorded current and longterm liabilities for known future environmental costs we could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

the majority of our employees belong to labor unions and labor agreements strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations – we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in the united states under the collective bargaining round that began on november 1 1999 11 of the 14 major rail unions reached new labor agreements we are currently negotiating new agreements with the remaining three unions on november 1 2004 notices for the next round of negotiations were sent to all 14 unions by the national railway labor conference on behalf of uprr and other carriers in the conference these legal notices state our desire to modify the current collective bargaining agreements disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in among other things strikes work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers if unionized workers were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown or other employees were to become unionized we could experience a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could significantly increase our costs for healthcare wages and other benefits which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

the availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations – changes in demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel particularly engineers and trainmen could each have a negative impact on our ability to meet demand for rail service unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we may be affected by general economic conditions – prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions affecting the producers and consumers of the commodities carried by us may have an adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and liquidity 

  

we utilize capital markets – we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements including the issuance of commercial paper from time to time and the sale of certain of our receivables market instability or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to commercial paper and reduce our credit ratings below investment grade which would prohibit us from utilizing our sale of receivables program and significantly increase the cost of issuing debt 

  

we are dependent on two key domestic suppliers of locomotives – due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment and its production there are high barriers of entry to potential new suppliers therefore if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives we could experience a significant cost increase and the potential for reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations 

  

we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations – we rely on information technology in all aspects of our business if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if we are unable to implement new technology we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and liquidity additionally if we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment we could experience a service interruption safety failure security breach or other operational difficulties which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures – severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including earthquakes fires and floods may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs increased liabilities and decreased revenues which could have an adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and liquidity 

  

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures – the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment 

  

personal injury property damage environmental and other matters any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving any or all of property damage personal injury and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and liquidity 

  

we may be affected by acts of terrorism war or risk of war – our rail lines facilities and equipment including rail cars carrying hazardous materials which we are required to transport under federal law could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks any terrorist attack or other similar event any government response thereto and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in addition premiums for some or all of our current insurance programs covering these losses could increase dramatically or insurance coverage for certain losses may not be available to us in the future

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

environmental matters 

  

as previously reported in our annual report on form 10k for 2003 the united states attorney for the central district of california notified us that the office intended to pursue criminal charges against us for alleged violations of federal environmental laws including the federal clean water act in connection with releases of oil and oil contaminated water from our taylor yard in 2001 and 2003 in april 2004 we settled the state of california’s claims arising from these releases for 45020 

  

as previously reported in our annual report on form 10k for 2003 the california department of toxic substances control dtsc threatened civil prosecution against us in november 2003 after a series of protracted negotiations relating to our failure to register as a hazardous waste transporter under california law from april 2000 to august 2001 we contend that we are exempt from the registration requirements due to federal preemption the dtsc has proposed civil penalties of 125160 for the alleged violation we continue to vigorously oppose this proposed penalty 

  

as previously reported in our annual report on form 10k for 2001 on january 30 2002 the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq issued to the railroad a notice of a proposed penalty assessment in the amount of 195700 the ldeq proposed penalty relates to the derailment of one of our trains carrying hazardous materials near eunice louisiana on may 27 2000 we met with the ldeq regarding this matter to present documentation indicating that no penalty should be assessed we have filed suit against the ldeq in louisiana state district court challenging the penalty 

  

as previously reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended march 31 2003 the san joaquin county district attorney filed an action against us on february 3 2003 alleging claims under the california business and professions code section 17200 unfair business practices fish and game code section 5650 and 56501 california health and safety code section 25189d and public nuisance california civil code 

  

section 3480 the claims arise from a february 16 2000 derailment in stockton california in which a locomotive struck an object on the tracks resulting in the puncture of a fuel tank the district attorney alleged that diesel fuel from this spill entered waters of the state of california the complaint also asserted claims under the above referenced statutes for any other diesel spill which may have occurred in the state of california between 2000 and 2003 in which diesel may have passed into waters of the state of california and seeks injunctive relief as well as civil penalties of 25000 for the alleged february 16 2000 diesel spill and total penalties of not less than 250000 for all diesel spills which may have occurred since 2000 the district attorney filed an amended complaint on april 10 2003 which narrowed the claims to the incident of february 16 2000 the amended complaint seeks both injunctive relief and daily penalties for each day that fuel was in the affected waterway which could exceed 100000 

  

as previously reported in our annual report on form 10k for 2003 a criminal case relating to a series of alleged releases of calcium oxide lime was filed against the railroad by the district attorneys of merced madera and stanislaus counties in california the criminal case was dismissed in the last quarter of 2003 and was subsequently refiled as a civil action by several counties the refiled suit sought civil penalties against the railroad in connection with the release of lime from an unidentified rail car between chowchilla and sacramento california on december 27 2001 and another incident in which lime leaked from a rail car between chowchilla and stockton california on february 21 2002 the suit contended that regulatory violations occurred by virtue of the railroad’s alleged failure to timely report the release of a “hazardous material” its alleged disposal of hazardous waste and the alleged release of material into the waters of the state of california on september 20 2004 the court dismissed the suit with prejudice the state appealed this decision and the appeal remains pending 

  

as previously reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended march 31 2002 on april 26 2002 we received written notice of a proposed 250000 penalty from the illinois environmental protection agency relating to a collision between trains from conrail and the railroad the collision occurred near momence illinois on march 23 1999 when an eastbound conrail train failed to stop at a signal and struck a uprr train that was properly occupying a crossing the collision resulted in a release of diesel fuel from the fuel tanks of our locomotive which was promptly reported and remediated we received notice in january 2003 that the amount of the proposed penalty including oversight costs had been reduced to 127000 we continue to vigorously oppose this proposed penalty 

  

as previously reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2004 the attorney general’s office of illinois filed an agreed order and complaint and a complaint for injunctive and other relief on october 7 2004 against the alton  southern railway company a wholly owned subsidiary of the railroad as a result of a collision and derailment on september 21 2004 the state seeks to enjoin the alton  southern from further violations as well as impose a monetary penalty the amount of the proposed penalty is uncertain but could exceed 100000 

  

in december 2004 we were advised by the district attorney of riverside county california that the county intends to file either a criminal or civil action against the railroad as a result of the railroad’s alleged unlawful disposal of hazardous waste this claim arises out of an april 2004 incident in which a construction crew allegedly discarded hazardous waste into a dumpster that was subsequently taken to a landfill in cathedral city california the district attorney intends to seek fines or penalties in excess of 100000 

  

we have received notices from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are or may be liable under certain federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the united states including sites that are on the superfund national priorities list or state superfund lists although specific claims have been made by the epa and state regulators with respect to some of these sites the ultimate impact of these proceedings and suits by third parties cannot be predicted at this time because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites andor the speculative nature of remediation costs 

  

information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies – environmental item 7 

  

other matters 

  

as previously reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2004 we were notified that a qui tam or private citizen complaint was filed in the united states district court for the central 

  

district of california against among other parties the city of long beach city of long beach harbor department port of long beach the port union pacific corporation union pacific railroad company and union pacific resources company also known as union pacific resources group inc resources a former subsidiary of upc a private citizen filed the action because the federal government and the state of california elected not to pursue the claims the complaint alleges that the defendants violated the federal civil false claims act and the california false claims act by conspiring to use public funds to 1 shift environmental cleanup liability to the port when resources sold its terminal island oil field property to the port in 1994 and 2 effect the acquisition by the port of the terminal island property in which the port or the state of california allegedly already held certain incidents of title the complaint which has not been served on us seeks damages of 2405 billion unspecified costs for remediating groundwater contamination and treble damages and civil penalties of 10000 per day we dispute the factual and legal bases of the complaint also we have notified anadarko petroleum corporation anadarko as successor to resources after its acquisition in 2000 that an indemnification agreement between resources and the corporation obligates anadarko to indemnify us for all damages costs and expenses related to the complaint

results of operations 

  

   

income from continuing operations – income from continuing operations declined in 2004 due to higher fuel prices a 154 million aftertax asbestos charge higher operational costs associated with a slower network volumerelated expenses and wage and benefit inflation revenue growth of 6 partially offset the higher expenses 

  

the decrease in income from continuing operations in 2003 was a result of higher fuel prices inflation network costs including expenses associated with increased volumes lower gains from real estate sales 2002 asset sales included transactions with the utah transit authority uta for 141 million pretax and the santa clara valley transportation authority vta for 73 million pretax and debt redemption expenses which more than offset revenue gains lower interest expense and productivity improvements productivity is measured by both gross tonmiles per inflationadjusted expense dollar and gross tonmiles per employee 

  

operating revenues – operating revenue is comprised of commodity revenue and other revenues other revenues primarily include subsidiary revenue from various companies that are wholly owned or majority owned by the railroad revenue from our commuter rail operations and accessorial revenue earned due to customer detainment of railroad owned or controlled equipment we recognize commodity revenues on a percentageofcompletion basis as freight moves from origin to destination other revenue is recognized as service is performed or contractual obligations are met the allocation of revenue between reporting periods is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period 

  

operating revenues increased 664 million 6 to 122 billion in 2004 compared to an increase of 392 million 4 in 2003 commodity revenue increased 651 million 6 in 2004 and 378 million 4 in 2003 the increase in 2004 was driven by the industrial products intermodal and chemical commodity groups while growth in 2003 was generated by gains in the industrial products agricultural intermodal and energy commodity groups 

  

average revenue per car arc improved 3 to 1236 in 2004 compared to a 2 increase in 2003 while revenue carloads increased 2 and 1 in 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in both periods was driven by fuel surcharges price increases and indexbased contract escalators we recognized 330 million and 112 million in commodity revenue from our fuel surcharge programs in 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

other revenue increased 13 million 3 in 2004 driven by increased passenger and subsidiary revenue partially offset by a decrease in accessorial revenues in 2003 other revenue improved 14 million 3 due to higher passenger subsidiary and accessorial revenues 

  

the following tables summarize the yearoveryear changes in commodity revenue revenue carloads and average revenue per car by commodity type 

  



  

agricultural – the 2004 improvement was driven by increased demand for dry feed ingredients and the positive arc impact of longer average length of haul shipments corn and feed grain shipments also posted revenue gains as demand for these shipments to the pacific northwest improved revenue growth was also achieved through 

  

additional shipments for gulf export and wheat to mexico arc grew due to the positive mix impact of longer average length of haul shipments as well as price increases and fuel surcharges 

  

revenue growth in 2003 was driven by higher demand for gulf wheat exports and ethanol shipments revenue gains were also achieved through additional shipments of sugar beets due to a favorable crop in 2003 and canned and packaged foods resulting from additional longerhaul shipments from the west coast arc grew due to the positive mix impact of longer average length of haul shipments as well as price increases and fuel surcharges 

  

automotive – revenue growth in 2004 was attributable to increased volume of both finished vehicles primarily from international shippers and automotive materials shipments this was partially offset by a decline in shipments for domestic manufacturers due to lower production levels and weakened sales arc was up slightly in 2004 due to fuel surcharges and the favorable impact of longer average length of haul 

  

revenue growth in 2003 was driven by additional volume due to market share gains for materials shipments partially offset by a decline in revenues from domestic manufacturers as the softening economy weakened demand for finished vehicles and forced production cuts arc was up slightly in 2003 as price increases were partially offset by the mix impact of disproportionate growth in materials shipments which move at a lower revenue per car than finished vehicles 

  

chemicals – in 2004 liquid and dry chemical shipments were up due to overall economic activity led by intermediate chemicals and caustic soda soda ash or sodium carbonate which is an important raw material for manufacturing moves increased due to strong domestic and export demand plastics showed increases in both carloadings and revenue due to an improved economy and a stronger export market arc improved due to a mix shift toward longer average length of haul moves increased shipments of higharc soda ash and the positive effects of price increases and fuel surcharges 

  

in 2003 reduced plastics volume led the decline in carloads as the soft economy combined with higher input costs caused producers to lower inventories and reduce shipments growth of market demand for domestic and export soda ash partially offset the decline arc improved due to a mix shift toward longer average length of haul moves driven by fewer cars in storageintransit in addition to price increases and fuel surcharges 

  

energy – in 2004 overall volume was slightly down compared to record levels set in 2003 volume increased 9 for business originating in colorado due to strong demand for western highbtu coal supply constraints for eastern coal and imports will continue to increase the demand for western coal price increases and fuel surcharges drove arc improvements but were offset by the mix impact of shorter length of haul moves 

  

in 2003 strong utility demand due to lower inventories in the last three quarters more than offset the absence of export traffic from the colorado and utah mining regions as japan was sourcing coal from other far eastern producers arc increased primarily due to indexbased contract escalators 

  

industrial products – higher revenue in 2004 was driven by growth in lumber steel and nonmetallic minerals demand for lumber was driven by housing starts and continued low interest rates steel increased as strong global market demand limited imports and spurred demand for domestic steel arc improved due to price increases fuel surcharges and more higharc lumber moves 

  

revenue improvement in 2003 was attributable to government steel and lumber business growth the increase in government shipments was driven by movement of military equipment and ammunition in support of the war effort lumber positively impacted carloads as housing starts and low interest rates continued to drive demand steel and scrap shipments also increased as the weakening dollar created higher domestic and export demand for us produced steel augmented by market share gains arc rose due to price increases fuel surcharges and more higharc lumber moves reflecting demand for building materials 

  

intermodal – revenue increased in 2004 driven by improved overall economic conditions and an increase in imports from the far east as more domestic goods were manufactured or assembled overseas arc in 2004 improved due to fuel surcharges and price increases 

  

in 2003 carloads were up due to strong imports and improved economic conditions as well as the year over year impact of the labor dispute between the international longshoreman and warehouse union ilwu and the 

  

pacific maritime association pma which occurred primarily in the fourth quarter of 2002 arc in 2003 improved due to fuel surcharges and price increases 

  

mexico business – included in the commodity revenue reported above is revenue from shipments to and from mexico this revenue grew 9 to 970 million in 2004 compared to a 2 increase to 893 million for 2003 business gains in 2004 were led by increased volume in the industrial products intermodal chemical and automotive business groups particularly cement newsprint and wood fiber liquid and dry chemicals soda ash and automotive materials revenue growth was also driven by an increase in agricultural revenues resulting from both higher wheat exports and beer imports a decline in export shipments of corn and feed grains as well as a reduction in energy carloads partially offset the increases growth in 2003 was led by market share gains in automotive materials shipments and increased revenue for agricultural products resulting from higher corn and meal exports as well as increased beer imports 

  

operating expenses 

  

   

operating expenses increased in 2004 due to higher fuel prices an asbestos charge of 247 million pretax higher crew and asset utilization costs resulting from slower network velocity and volumerelated costs expenses in 2004 were also negatively impacted by wage and benefit inflation additional training expenses associated with an increase in trainmen employment levels increased depreciation expense and higher casualty costs relating to a jury verdict upheld against the railroad for a 1998 crossing accident and a derailment in san antonio texas in 2004 our service issues including increased hiring and training efforts added approximately 300 million in operating expenses during 2004 

  

operating expenses in 2003 were higher due to increased fuel prices wage and benefit inflation and volumerelated costs as well as higher operational costs resulting from a slower rail network in the third and fourth quarters of the year these increases were mitigated somewhat by lower depreciation expense a 2 reduction in employment levels and cost control efforts cost control efforts are defined as focused actions to reduce discretionary spending and failure costs 

  

salaries wages and employee benefits – the increase in 2004 was driven by wages and training expenses associated with an increase in trainmen employment levels increased crew costs due to slower network velocity inflation volumerelated expenses and severance costs associated with the relocation of various support functions to omaha nebraska lower protection costs and performancebased compensation expense for management partially offset these increases protection cost represents the differential payment when the wage earned for active employment is lower than an employee’s “protected” rate of pay an individual’s protected rate is imposed by the stb for employees adversely affected by a merger or is established by collective bargaining agreements we also benefited from cost savings driven by a smaller nontransportation workforce during the year 

  

the increase in 2003 resulted from the adoption of fasb statement no143 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas 143 which accounted for 110 million of the increase other drivers included inflation volumerelated costs protection costs increased crew utilization costs due to a shortage of available crews in the third and fourth quarters as well as higher pension expense 

  

equipment and other rents – equipment and other rents primarily includes rental expense the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies freight car intermodal and locomotive leases other 

  

specialty equipment leases and office and other rentals expenses increased in 2004 due to an increase in carload volumes which resulted in higher locomotive and car rental expenses and longer car cycle times resulting from slower network velocity the higher locomotive expense includes additional costs associated with leasing shortterm surge locomotive power which is more costly than longterm locomotive leases and the increased leasing of new locomotives which are being utilized for the higher business volumes and to improve network performance car cycle time is defined as the amount of time that a car spends on our system without changing its loadedunloaded status or having a new waybill issued 

  

conversely expenses decreased in 2003 due primarily to lower rental prices for private rail cars partially offset by higher locomotive lease expense and increased car cycle times driven by higher inventory of cars on the system due to slower network velocity in the third and fourth quarters of 2003 

  

depreciation – the majority of depreciation relates to track structure including rail ties and other track material depreciation expense increased in 2004 primarily due to a higher depreciable asset base caused by higher capital spending in recent years 

  

the 2003 decrease was driven by the adoption of fas 143 as well as the implementation of depreciation studies approved by the stb which resulted in lower depreciation rates in 2003 for certain track assets partially offset by increased rates for locomotives and other assets the higher depreciable asset base partially offset the favorable impact of fas 143 and the depreciation studies in 2003 

  

fuel and utilities – fuel and utilities include locomotive fuel utilities other than telephone and gasoline and other fuels the increases in 2004 and 2003 were driven by diesel fuel prices which averaged 122 092 and 073 per gallon in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively including taxes and transportation costs and higher gallons consumed on a yearoveryear basis the higher fuel price in 2004 contributed 416 million to the increase however approximately 52 of these costs were recovered through our fuel surcharge programs and are included in operating revenues the increase in gross tonmiles in 2004 and 2003 drove the higher fuel usage resulting in an additional 24 million and 25 million in fuel expense in each year respectively the railroad hedged approximately 9 and 13 of its fuel consumption for 2004 and 2003 in accordance with its hedging policy which decreased fuel costs by 14 million in 2004 and 28 million in 2003 gasoline utilities and propane expenses increased 13 million in 2004 and 12 million in 2003 due to higher prices 

  

materials and supplies – materials used for the maintenance of the railroad’s lines structures and equipment is the principal component of materials and supplies expense office small tools and other supplies and the costs of freight services purchased to ship company materials are also included expenses increased in 2004 due to increased use of locomotive repair materials associated with maintaining a larger fleet that includes older units not covered by warranties additional freight car repairs higher materials costs and increased freight charges for shipment of company material 

  

conversely expenses decreased in 2003 driven primarily by costs associated with track removal as well as fewer locomotive repairs cost control measures and a shift to more contracting of locomotive repairs which resulted in a corresponding increase to purchased services and other costs the 2003 reduction was partially offset by higher costs for locomotive materials 

  

casualty costs – personal injury expense freight and property damage insurance environmental matters and asbestos expense are included in casualty costs costs in 2004 increased due to the asbestos charge of 247 million pretax higher personal injury expense due to a 2002 jury verdict against the railroad for a 1998 crossing accident that was upheld on appeal in 2004 and costs related to a 2004 derailment near san antonio texas these increases were partially offset by reduced personal injury expense driven by lower than anticipated settlement costs and fewer employee injuries in 2004 than previously assumed in addition to lower expense for our insurance programs 

  

expenses in 2003 increased due to higher personal injury expense insurance costs due to increased premiums and expenses associated with destruction of foreign equipment destruction of foreign equipment expense is incurred when equipment owned by other railroads is destroyed while in our possession 

  

purchased services and other costs – purchased services and other costs include the costs of services purchased from outside contractors state and local taxes net costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other 

  

railroads transportation and lodging for train crew employees trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers leased automobile maintenance expenses telephone and cellular expense employee travel expense and computer and other general expenses expenses increased in 2004 as a result of higher locomotive contract maintenance services state and local taxes relocation costs associated with moving various support personnel to omaha nebraska and increased trucking expenses for intermodal carriers and crew transportation costs due to slower network velocity and additional volume 

  

similarly expenses rose in 2003 due to the drivers mentioned above in addition to higher contractrelated expenses resulting from the cost of track removal and joint facilities costs which were up due to reduced haulage receipts and increased expenses associated with a new joint facility contract 

  

the following table shows operating income and nonoperating financial results for periods ended december 31 

  

   

operating income – operating income decreased in 2004 as higher fuel prices a 247 million pretax asbestos charge resource utilization costs associated with suboptimal network operations volumerelated expenses wage and benefit inflation training expenses and higher casualty costs more than offset annual revenue growth of 6 our service issues including increased hiring and training efforts added approximately 300 million in operating expenses during 2004 

  

operating income in 2003 declined as productivity gains and lower depreciation expense were more than offset by higher fuel prices inflation volume and resource utilization costs experienced in the third and fourth quarters of 2003 

  

nonoperating items 

  

other income – the 2004 improvement in other income was a result of higher costs in 2003 associated with the early retirement of 15 billion of convertible preferred securities cps and income recognized in 2004 from the sale of assets of a technology subsidiary which were partially offset by lower gains from real estate sales in 2004 

  

the reduction in 2003 was primarily a result of higher 2002 real estate gains transactions included sales to the utah transit authority with a pretax value of 141 million and the santa clara valley transit authority with a pretax value of 73 million and the negative impact of the 2003 cps redemption costs 

  

interest expense – the improvement in interest expense in 2004 and 2003 was primarily due to declining weightedaverage debt levels of 81 billion 89 billion and 95 billion in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively which included the cps in 2003 and 2002 our effective interest rate was 65 in 2004 compared to 64 and 66 in 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

income taxes – income tax expense decreased in 2004 driven by lower pretax income a reduction in the deferred state income tax liability primarily attributable to relocating support operations to omaha nebraska state income tax credits earned in connection with the new headquarters building in omaha and an increase in foreign tax credits resulting from the passage of the american jobs creation act of 2004 

  

the decrease in 2003 was driven by lower pretax income which was partially offset by a tax adjustment recognized in 2002 for prior years’ income tax examinations our effective tax rate decreased to 294 in 2004 compared to 355 and 350 in 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

discontinued operations 

  

on november 5 2003 we completed the sale of our entire trucking interest revenues from discontinued operations were 12 billion and 13 billion in 2003 and 2002 respectively income from discontinued operations was 255 million and 76 million in 2003 and 2002 income from discontinued operations in 2003 included the net gain from the sale of our trucking interest of 211 million including an income tax benefit of 126 million 

  

other operating and financial statistics 

  

railroad performance measures 

  

we report key railroad performance measures weekly to the american association of railroads including carloads average train speed average daily inventory of rail cars on our system and average terminal dwell time which is a measure of the average time a rail car spends in hours at our terminals this operating data is available on our website at wwwupcominvestorsreportsindexshtml 

  

other operating statistics 

  

   

gross and revenue tonmiles – gross and revenue tonmiles increased 2 and 3 respectively in 2004 driven by carloading growth of 2 during the same period gross and revenue tonmiles both increased 3 in 2003 with carloading growth of 1 the increase in gross and revenue tonmiles in 2003 was positively impacted by volume growth experienced in the higher density commodity groups of industrial products and chemicals combined with a minimal increase in automotive carloads which is a lower density commodity gross tonmiles are calculated by multiplying the weight of a loaded or empty freight car by the number of actual miles hauled revenue tonmiles are based on tariff miles and do not include the weight of the freight car 

  

average fulltime equivalent employees – the 2004 increase in the average number of fulltime equivalent employees resulted from the addition of train crew personnel who were hired to handle increased customer demand and improve service these additions were partially offset by increased productivity in the nontransportation functions employee attrition and fewer employees at our technology subsidiaries in 2003 the number of fulltime equivalent employees decreased 2 due to productivity improvements and employee attrition 

  

other financial statistics 

  

   

debt to capitallease adjusted debt to capital – debt to capital is computed by dividing total debt by total debt plus equity lease adjusted debt to capital is derived by dividing total debt plus the net present value of operating leases by total debt plus equity plus the net present value of operating leases we believe these measures are important in managing our capital structure to allow efficient access to the debt market while minimizing our cost of capital the improvement in our 2004 debt to capital ratio resulted from an increase in equity due to earnings partially offset by an increase in our debt levels since yearend 2003 the increase in lease adjusted debt to capital was driven by higher debt levels and valuation of operating leases which were partially offset by higher equity 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

as of december 31 2004 our principal sources of liquidity included cash cash equivalents the sale of receivables and our revolving credit facilities as well as issuance of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets we had 20 billion of credit facilities available of which there were no borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2004 the sale of receivables program is subject to certain requirements including the maintenance of an investment grade credit rating if our credit rating were to deteriorate it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the program was 590 million as of december 31 2004 access to commercial paper is dependent on market conditions deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to utilize commercial paper as a source of liquidity liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability 

  

at december 31 2004 and 2003 we had a working capital deficit of 226 million and 367 million respectively a working capital deficit is not uncommon in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity we maintain adequate resources to meet our daily cash requirements and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

  

financial condition 

  

  

   

cash provided by operating activities – the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2004 was driven by lower income from continuing operations and cash from discontinued operations recognized in 2003 which was partially offset by working capital performance the increase from 2002 to 2003 was due to working capital performance and higher cash from the discontinued operations partially offset by lower income from continuing operations 

  

cash used in investing activities – the increase in 2004 resulted from 620 million received in 2003 for the sale of our trucking interest a large dividend from an affiliate in 2003 and reduced asset sales in 2004 the reduction in use of cash in 2003 was primarily driven by proceeds of 620 million from the sale of our trucking interest which was partially offset by lower proceeds from asset sales and increased 2003 capital spending 

  

cash used in financing activities – the decrease in 2004 was driven by lower debt repayments of 588 million in 2004 compared to 21 billion in 2003 including 15 billion of cps partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from stock option exercises 102 million in 2004 compared to 216 million in 2003 and higher dividend payments 310 million in 2004 versus 234 million in 2003 the increase in 2003 reflects higher debt repayments of 21 billion in 2003 including 15 billion of cps compared to 12 billion in 2002 and higher dividend payments partially offset by an increase in proceeds from stock option exercises of 66 million 

  

the table below details capital expenditures for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 including noncash capital lease financings of 188 million and 126 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively there were no noncash capital lease financings in 2004 

  

   

in 2005 we expect our cash capital expenditures to be approximately 2 billion these expenditures will be used to maintain track and structures continue capacity expansions on our main lines in constrained corridors remove bottlenecks upgrade and augment equipment to better meet customer needs build and improve facilities and terminals and develop and implement new technologies we expect to fund our 2005 capital expenditures through cash generated from operations additional debt financings the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties and cash on hand at december 31 2004 we expect that these sources will continue to provide sufficient funds to meet our expected capital requirements for 2005 in addition to cash capital expenditures we expect to acquire locomotives and certain other equipment through short and longterm operating leases 

  

for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 21 32 and 34 respectively the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis earnings represent income from continuing operations less equity earnings net of distributions plus fixed charges and income taxes fixed charges represent interest charges amortization of debt discount and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges the decline in our ratio was due primarily to lower income from continuing operations 

  

financing activities 

  

credit facilities – on december 31 2004 we had 20 billion in revolving credit facilities available including 10 billion under a 364day revolving facility expiring in march 2005 and 10 billion under a 5year facility expiring in march 2009 collectively the “facilities” the facilities which were entered into during march 2004 are designated for general corporate purposes and replaced a 925 million 364day revolving credit facility that expired in march 2004 and a 10 billion 5year revolving credit facility which was due to expire in march 2005 neither of the facilities were drawn as of december 31 2004 commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facilities are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investmentgrade borrowers like the revolving credit facilities that were replaced these facilities allow for borrowings at floating liborbased rates plus a spread depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings the facilities do not include any other financial restrictions credit rating triggers other than ratingdependent pricing or any other provision that could require the posting of collateral the facilities require the maintenance of minimum net worth and debt to net worth coverage ratios at december 31 2004 we were in compliance with these covenants 

  

to the extent we have longterm credit facilities available we have reclassified certain shortterm debt to a longterm basis at december 31 2004 and 2003 approximately 440 million and 324 million of shortterm borrowings that we intend to refinance were reclassified as longterm debt this reclassification reflects our intent to refinance these shortterm borrowings and current maturities of longterm debt on a longterm basis through the issuance of commercial paper or new longterm financings or by using the currently available longterm credit facility if alternative financing is not available we are reviewing rollover options for the 364day credit facility that expires in march 2005 

  

dividend restrictions – retained earnings available for dividends decreased to 52 billion at december 31 2004 from 69 billion at december 31 2003 due to revisions in minimum net worth requirements under the credit facilities referred to above we do not expect that these restrictions will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

shelf registration statement and significant new borrowings – on may 4 2004 we issued the remaining 250 million available under a shelf registration statement filed in 2002 we issued 5375 fixed rate debt with a maturity of may 1 2014 also on may 4 2004 we issued 250 million of 625 fixed rate debt with a maturity of may 1 2034 under a 10 billion shelf registration statement filed in 2003 on november 23 2004 we issued an additional 250 million of 4875 fixed rate debt with a maturity of january 15 2015 under the 2003 shelf registration statement the proceeds from the issuances were used for the repayment of debt and other general corporate purposes under the 2003 shelf registration statement we may issue from time to time any combination of debt securities preferred stock common stock or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings at december 31 2004 we had 500 million remaining for issuance under the 2003 shelf registration statement we have no immediate plans to issue equity securities however we will continue to explore opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under this shelf registration 

  

operating lease activities 

  

as of december 31 2004 our total aggregate contractual obligations for operating leases were approximately 34 billion during 2004 the railroad entered into longterm operating lease arrangements covering 376 new locomotives these new lease arrangements provide for minimum total rental payments of approximately 506 million the lessors of the locomotives were investors that purchased the locomotives in various transactions for a total equipment cost of approximately 601 million the railroad also entered into similar longterm operating lease arrangements for freight cars with a total equipment cost of approximately 53 million and minimum total rent payments of approximately 76 million 

  

the lessors financed the purchase of the locomotives and freight cars in part by the issuance of equipment notes that are nonrecourse to us and are secured by an assignment of the underlying leases and a security interest in the equipment neither the railroad nor upc guarantees payment of the equipment notes the railroad’s obligations to make operating lease payments under the leases are recourse obligations and are not recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position 

  

we have certain renewal and purchase options with respect to the locomotives and freight cars additionally we have flexible return rights with respect to a portion of the locomotives if we do not exercise any such options or flexible return rights the equipment will be returned to the lessors at the end of the lease term 

  

on october 5 2004 the railroad completed the refinancing of a new headquarters building in omaha nebraska with a synthetic lease which is an offbalance sheet financing arrangement as discussed below the lease has a term of 10 years with total scheduled lease payments of approximately 134 million 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements contractual obligations and commitments 

  

as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements item 8 and as referenced in the tables below we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition however based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments including material sources of offbalance sheet and structured finance arrangements there is no known trend demand commitment event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition the commercial obligations financings and commitments made by us are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable industrial corporations particularly within the transportation industry 

  

the following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of december 31 2004 

  

   

     

   

      

sale of receivables – the railroad transfers most of its accounts receivable to union pacific receivables inc upri a bankruptcyremote subsidiary as part of a sale of receivables facility upri sells without recourse on a 364day revolving basis an undivided interest in such accounts receivable to investors the total capacity to sell undivided interests to investors under the facility was 600 million at december 31 2004 the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the facility was 590 million at both december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors is not included in our consolidated financial statements the value of the undivided interest held by investors was supported by 1089 million and 1048 million of accounts receivable held by upri at december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 respectively at december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 the value of the interest retained by upri was 499 million and 458 million respectively this retained interest is included in accounts receivable in our consolidated financial statements the interest sold to investors is sold at carrying value which approximates fair value and there is no gain or loss recognized from the transaction 

  

the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors could fluctuate based upon the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks including default and dilution if default or dilution percentages were to increase one percentage point the amount of eligible receivables would decrease by 6 million should our credit rating fall below investment grade the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would be reduced and in certain cases the investors would have the right to discontinue the facility 

  

the railroad has been designated to service the sold receivables however no servicing asset or liability has been recognized as the servicing fees adequately compensate the railroad for its responsibilities the railroad collected approximately 122 billion and 113 billion during the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively upri used such proceeds to purchase new receivables under the facility 

  

the costs of the sale of receivables program are included in other income and were 11 million 10 million and 13 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the costs include interest program fees paid to banks commercial paper issuing costs and fees for unused commitment availability 

  

the investors have no recourse to the railroad’s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims creditors of the railroad have no recourse to the assets of upri on august 5 2004 the sale of receivables program was renewed for an additional 364day period without any significant changes in terms 

  

headquarters building – on october 5 2004 the railroad completed the refinancing of the synthetic lease for the new headquarters building the railroad will lease the building pursuant to an operating lease with a term of ten years total scheduled lease payments during the term are approximately 134 million upc has guaranteed the obligations of the railroad under the lease and therefore has a contingent liability for such obligations the obligations of the railroad to make lease payments are not recorded in the consolidated financial statements of 

  

the railroad or upc during the term of the lease the railroad may at its option purchase the building such purchase amount which was 2575 million will represent the cost of constructing the building including capitalized interest and transaction expenses any such payment may also include an additional makewhole amount for early redemption of the outstanding debt which will vary depending on prevailing interest rates at the time of prepayment 

  

upon expiration of the lease term if the railroad does not purchase the building or renew the lease the building will be remarketed the railroad has guaranteed that the building will have a residual value equal to at least 206 million in the event that the building is remarketed therefore the guarantee made by upc with respect to the railroad’s obligations under the lease is expected to represent a contingent obligation of approximately 206 million at december 31 2004 the railroad had a liability of approximately 6 million related to the fair value of this guarantee 

  

the arrangement is subject to customary default provisions including without limitation those relating to payment defaults under the lease and the operative documents the acceleration of certain other unrelated debt obligations of the railroad or upc performance defaults and events of bankruptcy in the event that such defaults occur and are continuing the railroad or upc pursuant to its guarantee may be required to pay all amounts due under the lease through the end of the term of the lease 

  

other matters 

  

inflation – the cumulative effect of long periods of inflation has significantly increased asset replacement costs for capitalintensive companies as a result assuming that all operating assets are replaced at current price levels depreciation charges on an inflationadjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 

  

derivative financial instruments – we use derivative financial instruments in limited instances for other than trading purposes to manage risk related to changes in fuel prices and to achieve our interest rate objectives we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged both at inception and throughout the hedged period we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items as well as our riskmanagement objectives strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness we may use swaps collars futures andor forward contracts to mitigate the downside risk of adverse price movements and to hedge the exposure to variable cash flows the use of these instruments also limits future benefits from favorable movements the purpose of these programs is to protect our operating margins and overall profitability from adverse fuel price changes or interest rate fluctuations 

  

market and credit risk – we address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item credit risk related to derivative financial instruments which is minimal is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements at december 31 2004 we have not been required to provide collateral nor have we received collateral relating to our hedging activities 

  

in addition we enter into secured financings in which the debtor has pledged collateral the collateral is based upon the nature of the financing and the credit risk of the debtor we generally are not permitted to sell or repledge the collateral unless the debtor defaults 

  

determination of fair value – the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions at december 31 2004 and 2003 were determined based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or developed based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the applicable us treasury rate london interbank offered rates libor or swap spread 

  

sensitivity analyses – the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates or fuel prices could have on our results of operations and financial condition these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 

  

interest rate fair value hedges – we manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period the mix of fixed and floating rate debt is largely managed through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as incremental borrowings are required derivatives are used as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix in addition we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixedrate debt securities 

  

at december 31 2004 and 2003 we had variablerate debt representing approximately 9 and 10 respectively of our total debt if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2005 than our december 31 2004 variable rate which was approximately 5 our interest expense would increase by approximately 8 million if variable interest rates averaged one percentage point higher in 2004 than our december 31 2003 variable rate which was approximately 3 our interest expense would have increased by approximately 7 million this amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the balances of our variablerate debt at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt’s fair value attributable to the changes in the benchmark interest rate libor the swaps have been accounted for as fair value hedges using the shortcut method as allowed by fasb statement no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  therefore no ineffectiveness has been recorded within our consolidated financial statements in april 2004 we entered into an interest rate swap on 250 million of debt with a maturity of april 15 2012 as of december 31 2004 and 2003 we had interest rate swaps hedging debt of approximately 750 million and 818 million respectively 

  

market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2004 and amounts to approximately 599 million at december 31 2004 market risk resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2003 amounted to approximately 573 million at december 31 2003 the fair values of our fixedrate debt were estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 

  

interest rate cash flow hedges – in may 2004 in anticipation of a future lease transaction we entered into treasury lock transactions with notional amounts totaling 125 million and an average lockedin rate of 508 the treasury locks are accounted for as cash flow hedges on september 28 2004 the treasury locks were settled in connection with a 10year operating lease commencing on october 5 2004 and maturing on september 30 2014 the settlement of these treasury lock transactions was based on a treasury yield of 401 and resulted in a payment of 11 million to our counterparty that is being amortized to rent expense over the life of the 10year operating lease as of december 31 2004 and 2003 we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding 

  

fuel cash flow hedges – fuel costs are a significant portion of our total operating expenses in 2004 and 2003 our primary means of mitigating the impact of adverse fuel price changes was our fuel surcharge program however we may use swaps collars futures andor forward contracts to further mitigate the impact of adverse fuel price changes 

  

we currently have no fuel hedges in place for 2005 as of december 31 2003 collars were in place for 9 of expected fuel consumption for 2004 the collars had a floor of 064 a cap of 074 and a ceiling of 086 per gallon excluding taxes transportation costs and regional pricing spreads based on annualized fuel consumption during 2004 each onecent increase in the price of fuel would have resulted in approximately 85 million of additional fuel expense after tax as of december 31 2002 we hedged approximately 7 of our forecasted 2003 fuel consumption using fuel swaps at 058 per gallon excluding taxes transportation costs and regional pricing spreads 

  

accounting pronouncements – in december 2004 the fasb issued statement no 123 r sharebased payment  this statement which is effective for the corporation beginning july 1 2005 requires that companies recognize compensation expense equal to the fair value of stock options or other share based payments we anticipate the impact of this pronouncement will not differ materially from what has been disclosed in our pro 

  

forma net income located in our significant accounting policies section of the consolidated financial statements and applicable notes to the consolidated financial statements item 8 

  

asbestos – we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees allege exposure to asbestos additionally we have received claims for asbestos exposure that have not been litigated the claims and lawsuits collectively referred to as “claims” allege occupational illness resulting from exposure to asbestoscontaining products in most cases the claimants do not have credible medical evidence of physical impairment resulting from the alleged exposures additionally most claims filed against us do not specify an amount of alleged damages 

  

the greatest potential for asbestos exposure in the railroad industry existed while steam locomotives were used the railroad industry including uprr and its predecessors phased out steam locomotives in approximately 19551960 the use of asbestoscontaining products in the railroad industry was substantially reduced after steam locomotives were discontinued although it was not completely eliminated some asbestoscontaining products were still manufactured in the building trade industry and were used in isolated component parts on locomotives and railroad cars during the 1960s and 1970s by the early 1980s manufacturers of building materials and locomotive component parts developed nonasbestos alternatives for their products and ceased manufacturing asbestoscontaining materials 

  

prior to 2004 we concluded it was not possible to reasonably estimate the cost of disposing of asbestosrelated claims that might be filed against us in the future due to a lack of sufficient comparable history from which to reasonably estimate unasserted asbestosrelated claims as a result we recorded a liability for asbestosrelated claims only when the claims were asserted 

  

we believe we can now reasonably estimate a liability for unasserted asbestosrelated claims because we have sufficient comparable loss data and there is no immediate legislative solution to asbestos litigation during 2004 we engaged a thirdparty expert with extensive experience in estimating resolution costs for asbestosrelated claims to assist us in assessing the number and value of these unasserted claims through 2034 based on our average claims experience over a multiyear period as a result we increased our liability for asbestosrelated claims to 326 million at december 31 2004 17 million was classified as current liabilities while the remainder was classified as longterm accrued casualty costs approximately 14 of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 86 related to unasserted claims these claims are expected to be paid out over the next 30 years a summary of asbestosrelated claims activity in recent years follows 

  

   

we have insurance coverage that reimburses us for a portion of the costs incurred to resolve asbestosrelated claims at december 31 2004 we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries 

  

we believe that our liability for asbestosrelated claims and the estimated insurance recoveries reflect reasonable and probable estimates the amounts recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts however future events such as the number of new claims to be filed each year average settlement costs and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts estimates may also vary due to changes in the litigation environment federal and state law governing compensation of asbestos claimants and the level of payments made to claimants by other defendants 

  

commitments and contingencies – various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries we are also subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations pursuant to which we are currently participating in the investigation and remediation of various sites we do not expect that any known lawsuits claims environmental costs commitments contingent liabilities or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity after taking into account liabilities previously recorded for these matters

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements item 8 these critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 

  

asbestos – we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees allege exposure to asbestos additionally we have received claims for asbestos exposure that have not been litigated a liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted asbestosrelated claims through 2034 has been estimated and recorded a thirdparty expert with experience in estimating resolution costs for asbestosrelated claims assisted us in assessing our potential liability the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions 

  

   

   

   

   

as a result of the assessment for unasserted asbestosrelated claims we increased our liability for asbestosrelated claims to 326 million at december 31 2004 17 million was classified as current liabilities while the remainder was classified as longterm accrued casualty costs approximately 14 of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 86 related to unasserted claims these claims are expected to be paid out over the next 30 years we have insurance coverage for a portion of the costs incurred to resolve asbestosrelated claims and we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries 

  

we believe that our liability for asbestosrelated claims and the estimated insurance recoveries reflect reasonable and probable estimates the amounts recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts however future events such as the number of new claims to be filed each year average settlement costs and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts estimates may also vary due to changes in the litigation environment federal and state law governing compensation of asbestos claimants and the level of payments made to claimants by other defendants 

  

environmental – we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations we have identified 384 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements this includes 52 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the 

  

us government 31 of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 

  

when an environmental issue has been identified with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in the conduct of our business we and our consultants perform environmental assessments on the property we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated we do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable 

  

environmental expense for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 were 46 million 26 million and 37 million respectively as of december 31 2004 and 2003 we had a liability of 201 million and 187 million respectively accrued for future environmental costs of which 50 million and 57 million respectively were recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties cost estimates are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and existing technology laws and regulations the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved sitespecific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

personal injury – the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year we use thirdparty actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the expense and liability including unasserted claims compensation for workrelated accidents is governed by the federal employers’ liability act fela under fela damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or outofcourt settlements we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work annual expenses for our personal injuryrelated events were 288 million in 2004 250 million in 2003 and 221 million in 2002 as of december 31 2004 and 2003 we had a liability of 639 million and 617 million accrued for future personal injury costs respectively of which 274 million was recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs in both years changes in estimates can vary due to evolving trends in litigation related to personal injury cases 

  

depreciation – the railroad industry is capital intensive properties are carried at cost provisions for depreciation are computed principally on the straightline method based on estimated service lives of depreciable property the lives are calculated using a separate composite annual percentage rate for each depreciable property group based on the results of a depreciation study we are required to submit a report on depreciation studies and proposed depreciation rates every three years for equipment property and every six years for road property to the stb for review and approval the cost net of salvage of depreciable rail property retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized a gain or loss is recognized in other income for all other property upon disposition the cost of internally developed software is capitalized and amortized over a fiveyear period an obsolescence review of capitalized software is performed on a periodic basis 

  

capital spending in recent years has increased the total value of our depreciable assets cash capital spending totaled 19 billion for the year ended december 31 2004 in 2003 we implemented depreciation studies approved by the stb resulting in lower depreciation expense of 50 million for the year ended december 31 2003 due to a reduction in depreciation rates for certain track assets effective january 1 2003 partially offset by increased rates for locomotives and other assets effective july 1 2003 for the year ended december 31 2004 depreciation expense was 11 billion various methods are used to estimate useful lives for each group of depreciable property due to the capital intensive nature of the business and the large base of depreciable assets variances to those estimates could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year annual depreciation expense would 

  

decrease by approximately 37 million if the estimated useful lives of all assets to be depreciated were decreased by one year annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately 40 million 

  

income taxes – we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 

  

as required under financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes  these expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated future tax law changes such as a change in the corporate tax rate could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

  

when appropriate we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized based in part on management’s judgments regarding the best available evidence about future events based on that analysis we have recorded a valuation allowance of 11 million against certain deferred tax assets as of december 31 2004 

  

pension and other postretirement benefits – we use thirdparty actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and defined contribution medical and life insurance benefits opeb to eligible employees in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make several assumptions the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets for other postretirement benefits the critical assumptions are the discount rate and healthcare cost trend rate 

  

we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually and selected assumptions are based on the following factors 

  

   

   

   

the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure pension and opeb expense for 2004 and the estimated impact on 2004 pension and opeb expense relative to a change in those assumptions

 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

as of the end of the period covered by this report the corporation carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the corporation’s management including the corporation’s chief executive officer ceo and executive vice president – finance and chief financial officer cfo of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to exchange act rules 13a15 and 15d15 based upon that evaluation the ceo and the cfo concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report the corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in alerting them in a timely manner to material information relating to the corporation including its consolidated subsidiaries required to be included in the corporation’s periodic sec filings 

  

additionally the ceo and cfo determined that there have been no significant changes to the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting 

  

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

the management of union pacific corporation and subsidiary companies the corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f the corporation’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the corporation’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 

  

all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

  

the corporation’s management assessed the effectiveness of the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 in making this assessment it used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework based on our assessment management believes that as of december 31 2004 the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 

  

the corporation’s independent auditors have issued an audit report on our assessment of the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting this report appears on page 67 

  

january 31 2005 

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

  

union pacific corporation its directors and shareholders 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting that union pacific corporation and subsidiary companies the corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that the corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on the criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended december 31 2004 of the corporation and our report dated february 7 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule

continuing operations – the railroad is a class i railroad that operates in the united states we have approximately 33000 route miles linking pacific coast and gulf coast ports with the midwest and eastern united 

  

states gateways and providing several northsouth corridors to key mexican gateways we serve the western twothirds of the country and maintain coordinated schedules with other rail carriers for the handling of freight to and from the atlantic coast the pacific coast the southeast the southwest canada and mexico export and import traffic is moved through gulf coast and pacific coast ports and across the mexican and canadian borders railroad commodity revenue totaled 110 billion in 2003 and is comprised of the following six commodity groups 

  

agricultural – the transportation of agricultural products including whole grains for animal and human consumption and commodities produced from these grains food and beverage products and sweeteners provided 14 of 2003 commodity revenue with access to most major grain markets the railroad provides a critical link between the midwest and western producing areas and the primary pacific northwest pnw and gulf ports as well as mexico uprr also serves significant domestic markets including grain processors and feeders as well as ethanol producers in the midwest west south and rocky mountain states unit trains of grain efficiently shuttle between producers and export terminals or domestic markets primary food commodities consist of a variety of fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables dairy products and beverages which are moved to major us population centers for consumption express lane our premium and perishables service moving fruits and vegetables from the pnw and california to destinations in the east continues to draw market share from trucks frozen meat and poultry are also transported to the west coast ports for export while beverages are imported into the us from mexico sweeteners are primarily short haul sugar beet movements from the fields to the refineries both of which are located in idaho 

  

automotive – uprr is the largest automotive carrier west of the mississippi river serving seven vehicle assembly plants and distributing imported vehicles from six west coast ports and houston the railroad serves 42 vehicle distribution centers from which vehicles are delivered to all major western us cities these centers serve as railcartotruck haulaway operations for major domestic and international automotive manufacturers in addition to transporting finished vehicles uprr currently provides expedited handling of automobile materials in both boxcars and containers to several assembly plants converting automotive material shipments from the highway to rail is a key growth opportunity mexico is also an important contributor to the automotive market for the railroad as manufacturers continue to locate both vehicle manufacturing and parts facilities at locations throughout the country automotive materials flow north and south across the border bound for assembly plants in mexico the us and canada in 2003 the transportation of finished vehicles and automobile materials accounted for 11 of total commodity revenue 

  

chemicals – the transportation of chemicals provided 14 of uprr’s 2003 commodity revenue the railroad’s franchise enables it to serve the large chemical producing areas along the gulf coast as well as the rocky mountain region more than twothirds of the chemicals business consists of liquid and dry chemicals plastics and liquid petroleum products “pipeline” service designed to eliminate unnecessary stops in terminals reduces delivery times and significantly improves asset utilization for customers and the railroad in addition to transporting plastics customers also leverage uprr’s industry leading storageintransit yards for intermediate storage of plastic resins soda ash shipments originate in southwestern wyoming and california and are consumed primarily in glass producing markets in the east the west and abroad fertilizer movements originate on the gulf coast as well as in the west and canada bound for major agricultural endusers in the midwest and the western us 

  

energy – coal transportation accounted for 22 of uprr’s 2003 commodity revenue the railroad’s geographic footprint positions it to transport coal destined for utilities and industrial facilities in 27 states as well as to the gulf and railbargeship facilities on the mississippi and ohio rivers and the great lakes uprr serves mines located in the southern powder river basin of wyoming in addition to colorado utah southern wyoming and southern illinois southern powder river basin coal represents the largest and fastest growing segment of the market as utilities continue to favor its low cost and lowsulfur content in addition uprr continues to penetrate markets in the east as electricity generation continues to grow in the face of declining eastern coal production highbtu lowsulfur coal from colorado and utah is also transported to domestic utilities and industries as well as for export to mexico 

  

industrial products – industrial products includes a broad range of commodities from bulk products like stone cement minerals waste and scrap to highervalue shipments like lumber paper and government and consumer goods bulk commodities often move in unit train service from origin to a distribution facility in major metropolitan areas other commodities move in manifest trains and rely on the railroad’s extensive network to move between thousands of shippers and customers across north america uprr continues to focus on capturing share from trucks by providing consistent and reliable service in 2003 the transportation of industrial products provided 20 of total commodity revenue 

  

intermodal – uprr’s intermodal business which represents 19 of 2003 commodity revenues is classified as international domestic or premium shipments international business consists of international container traffic for steamship customers it arrives at west coast ports for destinations throughout the united states domestic business includes domestic container and trailer traffic handled by intermodal marketing companies primarily shipper agents and consolidators and truckload carriers lessthantruckload and package carriers with time sensitive business requirements account for the majority of the premium business service performance and reliability drive intermodal business growth as modeled by the 60hour transcontinental rail service solution provided by the railroad and its partnering rail carrier to ups in 2003 

  

working capital – we currently have and historically have had a working capital deficit which is not uncommon in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity or financial stability we maintain adequate resources to meet our daily cash requirements and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

  

competition – we are subject to competition from other railroads motor carriers and barge operators our main rail competitor is burlington northern santa fe corporation its rail subsidiary the burlington northern and santa fe railway company operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors in addition our operations are conducted in corridors served by other competing railroads and by motor carriers motor carrier competition is particularly strong with respect to five of our six commodity groups excluding energy due to shorter delivery times offered by such carriers because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and gulf coast waterways barge competition can be particularly pronounced especially for grain and bulk commodities competition can pressure both transit time requirements and pricing as well as place a greater emphasis on the quality and reliability of the service provided while we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality of these alternative modes of transportation in the locations in which we operate or legislation granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

equipment suppliers – we are dependent on two key suppliers of locomotives due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of this equipment and its production there are strong barriers of entry to potential new suppliers therefore if one of these suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives we could realize a significant increase in the cost and the potential for reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations 

  

employees – approximately 86 of our 46000 full time equivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions national negotiations under the railway labor act to revise the national labor agreements for all crafts began in late 1999 

  

in may 2001 the brotherhood of maintenance of way employees bmwe ratified an agreement which included provisions for wage increases based on the consumer price index and progressive employee health and welfare cost sharing rates 

  

in august 2002 the carriers reached an agreement with the united transportation union utu that incorporated wage increases the agreement also provided for the operation of remote control locomotives 

  

by trainmen that was challenged by the brotherhood of locomotive engineers ble a january 2003 arbitration decision held that the operation of remote control locomotives in terminals does not violate the ble agreement in november 2003 agreement was reached with the utu on employee health and welfare cost sharing rates and plan design changes 

  

in november 2002 the international brotherhood of boilermakers and blacksmiths ibb reached an agreement that incorporated wage increases 

  

in january 2003 an arbitration award was rendered establishing wage increases and employee health and welfare cost sharing rates for the transportation communications international union tcu health and welfare plan design changes were also part of the tcu agreement 

  

other settled agreements that incorporated wage increases and employee health and welfare cost sharing rates combined with plan design changes include the brotherhood of railway signalmen brs in september 2003 and the brotherhood of locomotive engineers ble in december 2003 contract discussions with the remaining unions are either in negotiation or mediation 

  

all settlements previously discussed include a five year contract period expiring december 31 2004 

  

effective january 2004 the brotherhood of locomotive engineers merged with the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt the ble has changed its name to the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen blet 

  

discontinued operations – in november 2003 we completed the sale of our entire trucking interest and as a result the operations of otc and motor cargo are included in discontinued operations see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements item 8 otc is a major interstate trucking company specializing in lessthantruckload shipments otc serves all 50 states and portions of canada and mexico through 170 service centers located throughout the united states providing regional interregional and long haul service otc transports a variety of products including machinery tobacco textiles plastics electronics and paper products motor cargo is a western regional lessthantruckload carrier that provides comprehensive service throughout 10 western states motor cargo transports general commodities including consumer goods packaged foodstuffs industrial and electronic equipment and auto parts

health and the environment the statutes and regulations are administered and monitored by the environmental protection agency epa and by various state environmental agencies those laws primarily affecting our operations are the resource conservation and recovery act of 1976 regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1976 regulating the cleanup of contaminated properties the clean air act regulating air emissions and the clean water act regulating waste water discharges 

  

information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies – environmental item 7 

  




 risk factors 

  

we face competition from other railroads and other transportation providers  we are subject to competition from other railroads which operate parallel routes in many of our traffic corridors in addition to motor carriers and to a lesser extent ships barges and pipelines competition can pressure both transit time requirements and pricing as well as place a greater emphasis on the rate charged and the quality and reliability of the service provided while we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges are able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality of these alternative modes of transportation in the locations in which we operate or legislation granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we are subject to significant governmental regulation  we are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal state and local authorities with respect to our railroad operations and a variety of health safety labor environmental as discussed below and other matters our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us governments may change the legislative or regulatory framework within which we operate without providing us with any recourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on our business also some of the regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses permits and other authorizations and we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to do so 

  

we are subject to significant environmental laws and regulations  our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waters and the handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases we generate and transport hazardous and nonhazardous waste in our current operations and we have done so in our former operations environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties leased properties and properties owned by third parties as well as to properties currently owned and used by us environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation we have been and may be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that we have violated or are strictly liable under these laws or regulations although we have appropriately recorded current and longterm liabilities for known future environmental costs we could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

rising fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our business  fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses diesel fuel prices are subject to dramatic fluctuations significant price increases may have a material adverse effect on our operating results additionally fuel prices and supplies are influenced significantly by international political and economic circumstances if a fuel supply shortage were to arise from opec production curtailments a disruption of oil imports or otherwise higher fuel prices and any subsequent price increases would despite our fuel surcharge programs materially affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity 

  

the majority of our employees belong to labor unions and strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations  we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in the united states some of these agreements expire within the next two years disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in among other things strikes work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers if the unionized workers were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown or other employees were to become unionized or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and higher ongoing labor costs 

  

we may be affected by general economic conditions  several of the commodities we transport come from industries with cyclical business operations as a result prolonged negative changes in domestic and global 

  

economic conditions affecting the producers and consumers of the commodities carried by us may have an adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and liquidity 

  

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures  severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including earthquakes fires and floods may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs increased liabilities and decreased revenues which could have an adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and liquidity 

  

we are dependent on two key suppliers of locomotives  due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotives there are strong barriers to entry for new suppliers therefore if one of these suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives we could realize a significant increase in the cost and the potential for reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations 

  

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures  the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury and property damage environmental and other matters any material changes to current litigation trends could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and liquidity 

  

we may be affected by future acts of terrorism or war or risk of war  terrorist attacks such as those that occurred on september 11 2001 any government response thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition our ability to raise capital or our future growth our rail lines and facilities could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act or acts of terror which could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues and have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition or liquidity any act of terror retaliatory strike sustained military campaign or war or risk of war may have an adverse impact on our operating results financial condition and liquidity by causing or resulting in unpredictable operating or financial conditions including disruptions of rail lines volatility or sustained increase of fuel prices fuel shortages general economic decline and instability or weakness of financial markets which could restrict our ability to raise capital in addition insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverages currently maintained by us could increase dramatically or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the following are our critical accounting policies that affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 

  

depreciation – the railroad industry is capital intensive properties are carried at cost provisions for depreciation are computed principally on the straightline method based on estimated service lives of depreciable property the lives are calculated using a separate composite annual percentage rate for each depreciable property group based on the results of a depreciation study we are required to submit a report on depreciation studies and proposed depreciation rates every three years for equipment property and every six years for road property to the surface transportation board for review and approval the cost net of salvage of depreciable rail property retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized a gain or loss is recognized in other income for all other property upon disposition the cost of internally developed software is capitalized and amortized over a fiveyear period an obsolescence review of capitalized software is performed on a periodic basis 

  

capital spending in recent years has increased the total value of our depreciable assets capital spending totaled 19 billion for the year ended december 31 2003 including noncash financings of 188 million in 2003 we implemented depreciation studies approved by the surface transportation board resulting in lower depreciation expense of 50 million for the year ended december 31 2003 due to a reduction in depreciation rates for certain track assets effective january 1 2003 partially offset by increased rates for locomotives and other assets effective july 1 2003 for the year ended december 31 2003 depreciation expense was 11 billion various methods are used to estimate useful lives for each group of depreciable property due to the capital intensive nature of the business and the large base of depreciable assets variances to those estimates could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year annual depreciation expense would decrease by 36 million if the estimated useful lives of all assets to be depreciated were decreased by one year annual depreciation expense would increase by 39 million 

  

environmental – we generate and transport hazardous and nonhazardous waste in our current operations and have done so in our former operations and we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations we have identified approximately 417 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements this includes 51 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government 29 of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 

  

when an environmental issue has been identified with respect to the property owned leased or otherwise used in the conduct of our business we and our consultants perform environmental assessments on such property we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated 

  

the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as for ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties cost estimates are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and existing technology laws and regulations we believe that we have adequately accrued for our ultimate share of costs at sites subject to joint and several liability however the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved sitespecific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites andor the speculative nature of remediation costs for the year ended december 31 2003 and 2002 we recorded environmental expenses of 26 million and 37 million for continuing operations respectively as of december 31 2003 and 2002 we had a liability of 187 million and 188 million respectively of which 57 million and 71 million were classified as current 

  

income taxes – we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 

  

as required under financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 109 “accounting for income taxes” these expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated future tax law changes such as a change in the corporate tax rate could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

  

when appropriate we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized based in part upon management’s judgments regarding future events based on that analysis we have determined that a valuation allowance is not appropriate at december 31 2003 

  

pension and other postretirement benefits – we provide defined benefit retirement income to eligible nonunion employees through qualified and nonqualified supplemental pension plans qualified and nonqualified pension benefits are based on years of service and the highest compensation during the latest years of employment with specific reductions made for early retirements we also provide other postretirement benefits opeb all nonunion and certain of our union employees participate in defined contribution medical and life insurance programs for retirees 

  

we account for our pension plans in accordance with fasb statement no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” fas 87 and our postretirement benefits in accordance with fasb statement no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” fas 106 fas 87 and fas 106 require us to make various estimates and assumptions including discount rates used to value liabilities expected rates of return on plan assets salary increases employee turnover rates anticipated employee mortality rates and expected future healthcare costs the estimates we used are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances and are updated at least annually we use thirdparty actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the expense and liability associated with these benefits 

  

funded status – the funded status of our pension plans represents the difference between the fair value of pension assets and the present value of pension liabilities projected benefit obligation or pbo the pbo is the present value of benefits earned to date by plan participants including the effect of assumed future salary increases the funded status is impacted by actual asset returns and cash funding as well as a yearend discount rate which is used to calculate the present value of the projected benefit obligation the discount rate we use for this purpose is based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows matching our plans’ expected benefit payments the opeb plan is unfunded and funding occurs as claims are paid the pbo of the opeb plan is equal to the accumulated benefit obligation as the present value of opeb liabilities is not affected by salary increases the discount rate used in valuing opeb obligations is equal to the pension discount rate for both 2003 and 2002 

  

the following table presents the funded status of our pension and opeb plans as well as the key assumptions that impact the funded status as of december 31 2003 

  

   

the following table shows the estimated impact that changes in the assumed discount rate salary increase and health care cost trend rate would have had on our projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2003 

  

   

cash contributions  we follow fas 87 rules to record the expense and liability associated with our pension plans however actual cash funding is governed by employee benefit and tax laws no cash funding was required for us in 2003 during 2003 we voluntarily contributed 100 million to our funded pension plan 

  

contributions required subsequent to 2003 are dependent on asset returns and future discount rates we do not anticipate minimum pension funding requirements in 2004 we voluntarily contributed 50 million in january of 2004 to help mitigate any potential required funding in the future future contributions are expected to be funded primarily by cash generated from operating activities 

  

cash funding for opeb benefits is based on claims paid claims paid net of retiree contributions totaled 37 million and 46 million for 2003 and 2002 respectively expected claims for 2004 total 35 million net of employee contributions 

  

expense  pension expense for 2003 was 15 million while we recorded pension income in 2002 of 14 million opeb expense for 2003 and 2002 was 43 million and 45 million respectively both pension and opeb expense is determined based upon the annual service cost of benefits the actuarial cost of benefits earned during a period and the interest cost on those liabilities less the expected return on pension plan assets for pension only with respect to the value of pension plan assets the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets that recognizes changes in fair value over a fiveyear period this practice is intended to reduce yeartoyear volatility in pension expense but it can have the effect of delaying the recognition of differences between actual returns on assets and expected returns based on longterm rate of return assumptions the expected rate of return on assets was 8 for 2003 and 9 for 2002 

  

differences in actual experience in relation to assumptions are not recognized immediately but are deferred and if necessary amortized as pension or opeb expense 

  

the following table illustrates the estimated impact on 2003 pension and opeb expense relative to a change in the discount rate expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rate 

  

   

personal injury and occupational illness – the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year we use third party actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the expense and liability compensation for workrelated accidents is governed by the federal employers’ liability act fela under fela damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or outofcourt settlements we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work annual expenses for our personal injuryrelated events were 250 million and 221 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively as of december 31 2003 and 2002 we had a liability of 617 million and 671 million accrued for future personal injury costs respectively of which 274 million was recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs in both years we have additional amounts accrued for claims related to certain alleged occupational illnesses changes in estimates can vary due to evolving trends in litigation related to personal injury and occupational illness cases based on large jury awards and public pressures associated with certain occupational related injuries 

  

results of operations 

  

   

income from continuing operations – the decrease in income from continuing operations in 2003 compared to 2002 was driven by higher fuel prices inflation network costs including expenses associated with increased volumes lower gains from real estate sales 2002 asset sales with the utah transit authority uta for 141 

  

million pretax and the santa clara valley transportation authority vta for 73 million pretax and debt redemption expenses which more than offset revenue gains lower interest expense and productivity improvements conversely the increase in income from continuing operations in 2002 compared to 2001 resulted from double digit operating income growth lower interest costs the two large asset sale transactions mentioned previously and tax adjustments of 33 million reflecting the outcome of income tax examinations for prior years operating income in 2002 improved as revenue growth productivity gains and lower fuel prices more than offset inflation increased depreciation expense and higher rail costs due to increased rail volume productivity is measured by both gross ton miles per inflationadjusted expense dollar and gross ton miles per employee gross ton miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of a loaded or empty freight car by the number of miles hauled 

  

operating revenues – operating revenue is comprised of commodity revenue and other revenues other revenues primarily include subsidiary revenue from various companies that are wholly owned or majority owned by the railroad revenue from the chicago commuter rail operations and accessorial revenue earned due to customer detainment of railroad owned or controlled equipment we recognize commodity revenues on a percentageofcompletion basis as freight moves from origin to destination other revenue is recognized as service is performed or contractual obligations are met 

  

operating revenues increased 392 million 4 to 116 billion in 2003 over 2002 following an increase of 329 million 3 in 2002 over 2001 commodity revenue increased 378 million 4 in 2003 and 272 million 3 in 2002 the increase in 2003 was driven by growth in the industrial products agricultural intermodal and energy commodity groups including revenue from our fuel surcharge programs while the increase in 2002 was a result of growth in the automotive intermodal agricultural and industrial products commodity groups revenue carloads increased 1 and 2 in 2003 and 2002 respectively while average revenue per car referred to as arc increased 2 to 1195 in 2003 and was 1168 and 1165 in 2002 and 2001 respectively other revenue increased 14 million 3 in 2003 and 57 million 13 in 2002 driven by increased passenger subsidiary and accessorial revenues in both years 

  

the following tables summarize the yearoveryear changes in commodity revenue revenue carloads and average revenue per car by commodity type 

  

   

   

   

agricultural – revenue in 2003 rose 5 due to a 4 improvement in arc and a 1 increase in carloads following revenue growth of 4 in 2002 resulting from a 3 gain in arc and a 1 growth in carloads in 2003 the improvement was driven by higher wheat demand for gulf exports in addition to added ethanol shipments resulting from heightened demand for the fuel additive revenue gains were also achieved through additional shipments of sugar beets due to a favorable crop in 2003 and canned and packaged foods resulting from additional longerhaul shipments from the west coast arc grew due to the positive mix impact of longer average length of haul shipments as well as price increases and fuel surcharges in 2002 revenues grew due to strong export demand and more shipments to mexico revenue gains were also achieved through increased shipments of cottonseed ethanol used as a fuel additive and frozen french fries arc rose due to higher average length of haul resulting from fewer shorthaul empty storage moves and corn processor shipments combined with additional longhaul meals and oils and animal feed shipments 

  

automotive – revenue increased 1 in 2003 as a result of a slight rise in both carloads and arc following an 8 increase in 2002 which resulted from a 7 gain in carloads and 1 growth in arc 2003 revenue growth was the result of additional volume due to market share gains for materials shipments partially offset by a decline in revenues from domestic manufacturers as the softening economy weakened demand for finished vehicles and forced production cuts arc was up slightly in 2003 as price increases were partially offset by the mix impact of disproportionate growth in materials shipments which move at a lower arc than finished vehicles in 2002 volume growth resulted from market share gains for finished vehicles where carloads were up 11 despite a decline in us light vehicle sales materials shipments declined 1 due primarily to reduced production in mexico market share gains partially offset the decline arc increased as a result of a shift in mix resulting from increased higher arc vehicles shipments and a decline in lower arc materials shipments in addition average length of haul for vehicle shipments increased due to mix of business 

  

chemicals – revenue in 2003 grew 1 as a 2 decline in carloads was offset by a 3 increase in arc revenue in 2002 rose 2 as a result of a 3 increase in carloads offset by a 1 decrease in arc in 2003 reduced plastics volume led the decline in carloads as the soft economy combined with higher input costs caused producers to lower inventories and reduce shipments growth of market demand for domestic and export soda ash partially offset the decline arc improved due to a mix shift toward longer average length of haul moves driven by fewer cars in storageintransit in addition to price increases and fuel surcharges conversely in 2002 volume rose for liquid and dry chemicals due to relatively higher economic demand from industrial manufacturers plastics shipments rose as a result of increased demand for consumer durables revenue also grew due to higher domestic demand for fertilizer and demand for domestic and export soda ash shipments arc declined during 2002 as a result of changes in customer contract terms 

  

energy – revenue climbed 3 in 2003 compared to a 2 decrease in 2002 in 2003 strong utility demand due to lower inventories in the last three quarters more than offset the absence of export traffic from the colorado and utah mining regions which japan is now sourcing from other far eastern producers resulting in a 1 increase in carloads fourth quarter carloads were the highest ever from the southern powder river basin and colorado and utah mining regions during 2003 tonnage moved from the southern powder river basin was also the highest ever for us arc increased 2 primarily due to indexbased contract escalators conversely the 2002 

  

revenue decrease was driven by a 3 decrease in arc arc declined due to the impact of contract price negotiations on expiring longterm contracts with certain major customers increased carloads and coal trains loaded per day in the southern powder river basin in wyoming were offset by reduced west coast export shipments originating from the colorado and utah mining regions 

  

industrial products – revenue increased 7 and 3 in 2003 and 2002 respectively revenue in 2003 was driven by 3 growth in arc and a 4 improvement in carloads which was attributable to government steel and lumber business growth the increase in government shipments was driven by movement of military equipment and ammunition in support of the war effort lumber positively impacted carloads as housing starts and low interest rates continue to drive demand steel and scrap shipments also increased as the weakening dollar created higher domestic and export demand for us produced steel augmented by market share gains arc rose due to price increases fuel surcharges and more higharc lumber moves revenue in 2002 was primarily driven by a 3 increase in arc augmented with a slight improvement in carloads increased lumber shipments were the primary growth driver due to strong housing construction and greater production in the pacific northwest region stone shipments grew due to strong building and road construction activity in the south higher general demand for paper and newsprint commodities also positively impacted revenues reduced shipments of steel and metallic shipments in the first three quarters partially offset these increases however steel shipments rebounded in the fourth quarter as new us tariffs made domestic producers more pricecompetitive with foreign producers arc improved due to price increases and a greater mix of longer average length of haul 

  

intermodal – revenue climbed 4 in 2003 driven by a 3 increase in arc and a 1 gain in carloads which followed a 5 increase in revenue for 2002 on the strength of a 4 gain in carloads in 2003 carloads were up due to strong imports and improved economic conditions as well as the year over year impact of the labor dispute between the international longshoreman and warehouse union ilwu and the pacific maritime association pma which occurred primarily in the fourth quarter of 2002 arc in 2003 improved due to fuel surcharges and price increases revenue in 2002 increased resulting from strong import demand truck conversion and price increases these gains were partially offset by the ilwupma labor dispute which had a significant impact on intermodal volumes during the fourth quarter primarily in october the slight increase in arc was the result of price increases offset by the mix impact of a greater number of lower revenue per car international shipments 

  

mexico business – included in the commodity revenue reported above is revenue from shipments to and from mexico this revenue grew 2 to 893 million in 2003 compared to a 1 increase to 873 million for 2002 business growth in 2003 was led by market share gains in auto parts shipments and increased revenue for agricultural products resulting from higher corn and meal exports as well as increased beer imports in 2002 shipments increased for agricultural products chemicals and industrial products commodity groups increased revenue for agricultural products resulted from higher corn and meal exports as well as increased beer imports increased chemicals business consisted of plastics exports in addition to higher imports and exports of liquid and dry chemicals reduced automobile production partially offset these gains resulting in fewer shipments of finished vehicles 

  

operating expenses  operating expenses increased 512 million 6 to 94 billion in 2003 compared to 2002 following an increase of 94 million 1 to 89 billion in 2002 compared to 2001 the increase in 2003 expenses was due primarily to higher fuel prices in addition to wage and benefit inflation and volumerelated costs as gross ton miles increased 3 for the year a 2 reduction in employment levels combined with lower depreciation expense and cost control efforts partially offset the increase cost control efforts are defined as focused actions to reduce discretionary spending and failure costs expenses in the third and fourth quarters were also negatively affected by increased crew and asset utilization costs associated with a deterioration in network fluidity as discussed under other matters in this item 7 the increase in 2002 expenses reflects wage and benefit inflation higher equipment rents depreciation expenses and increased purchased services and other costs these increases were partially offset by a 3 reduction in employment levels lower fuel prices and cost control efforts 

  

salaries wages and employee benefits – salaries wages and employee benefits were 39 billion 37 billion and 36 billion in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the increase in 2003 of 198 million 5 was driven by the 

  

adoption of fasb statement no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” fas 143 which accounted for 110 million of the increase other drivers included inflation volumerelated costs driven by a 3 increase in gross ton miles protection costs increased crew utilization costs due to a shortage of available crews and pension expense protection cost represents the differential payment when the wage earned for active employment is lower than an employee’s “protected” rate of pay an individual’s protected rate is imposed by the surface transportation board for employees adversely affected by a merger or is established by collective bargaining agreements in other cases the increase in 2002 of 108 million 3 was primarily driven by inflation and volumerelated costs associated with a 4 increase in gross ton miles a 3 reduction in employee force levels in conjunction with worker productivity improvements partially offset the inflation and higher volumerelated costs 

  

equipment and other rents – equipment and other rents primarily includes rental expense the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies freight car intermodal and locomotive leases other specialty equipped vehicle leases and office and other rentals expenses decreased 19 million 2 in 2003 compared to 2002 following an increase of 26 million 2 in 2002 from 2001 the decrease in 2003 was due primarily to lower rental prices for private railcars partially offset by higher locomotive lease expense and increased car cycle times driven by higher inventory of cars on the system due to slower network train speed in the third and fourth quarters conversely the increase in expense in 2002 compared to 2001 was driven by higher locomotive leases and volumerelated costs partially offset by savings from lower car cycle times car cycle time for equipment and other rents is defined as the average number of accumulated days that loaded and empty cars from other railroads spend on uprr’s system the higher locomotive lease expense in both years is attributable to the railroad’s increased leasing of new more reliable and fuel efficient locomotives these new locomotives replaced older nonleased models in the fleet which helped reduce expenses for depreciation labor materials and fuel during each year 

  

depreciation – the majority of depreciation relates to track structure including rail ties and other track material depreciation expense decreased 80 million 7 in 2003 from 2002 levels following an increase of 21 million 2 in 2002 compared to 2001 the 2003 decrease was driven by the adoption of fas 143 as well as the implementation of depreciation studies approved by the surface transportation board which resulted in lower depreciation rates in 2003 for certain track assets partially offset by increased rates for locomotives and other assets conversely capital spending in recent years has increased the total value of depreciable assets partially offsetting the favorable impact of fas 143 and the depreciation studies in 2003 the increase in expenses for 2002 compared to 2001 resulted primarily from a higher depreciable asset base 

  

fuel and utilities – fuel and utilities include locomotive fuel utilities other than telephone and gasoline and other fuels expenses increased 276 million 26 in 2003 over 2002 compared to a decrease of 184 million 15 in 2002 versus 2001 the increase in 2003 and decrease in 2002 were driven by fuel prices which averaged 92 73 and 88 cents per gallon in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively including taxes and transportation costs the higher fuel price in 2003 contributed 255 million to the increase however approximately 44 of these costs were recovered through our fuel surcharge programs and are included in operating revenues a 3 and 4 increase in gross ton miles in 2003 and 2002 resulted in an additional 25 million and 43 million in fuel expense additionally the railroad hedged approximately 13 and 42 of its fuel consumption for 2003 and 2002 in accordance with its policy applicable to hedging which decreased fuel costs by 28 million in 2003 and 55 million in 2002 

  

materials and supplies – materials used for the maintenance of the railroad’s lines structures and equipment is the principal component of materials and supplies expense office small tools and other supplies and the costs of freight services purchased to ship company materials are also included expenses decreased by 62 million 13 in 2003 and 11 million 2 in 2002 the lower expense in 2003 was primarily driven by costs associated with track removal additionally expense in both 2003 and 2002 decreased due to fewer locomotives repaired cost control measures and a shift to more contracting of locomotive repairs which resulted in a corresponding increase to purchased services and other costs the 2003 reduction was partially offset by higher costs for locomotive materials while the decrease in 2002 expense was partially offset by higher costs for freight car repairs 

  

casualty costs – the largest component of casualty costs is personal injury expense freight and property damage insurance environmental matters and occupational illness expense are also included in casualty costs costs in 2003 increased 57 million 16 following an increase of 30 million 9 in 2002 the increase in 2003 was driven by higher personal injury expense insurance costs due to increased premiums and expenses associated with destruction of foreign equipment destruction of foreign equipment expense is incurred when equipment owned by other railroads is damaged while in our possession higher personal injury and insurance costs in 2002 were partially offset by lower costs for freight damage and destruction of foreign equipment 

  

purchased services and other costs – purchased services and other costs include the costs of services purchased from outside contractors state and local taxes net costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other railroads transportation and lodging for train crew employees trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers leased automobile maintenance expenses telephone and cellular expense employee travel expense and computer and other general expenses expenses increased 142 million 15 in 2003 as a result of higher state and local taxes increased spending for contract services and joint facility expense crew transportation costs and trucking expenses for intermodal containers also increased due to network performance state and local taxes increased primarily as a result of higher income levels used to assess property taxes growth in contract services was primarily driven by higher costs for contracting of locomotive maintenance referenced in materials and supplies and contractrelated expenses resulting from the cost of track removal joint facilities costs were up due to reduced haulage receipts and increased expenses associated with a new joint facility contract expenses increased 104 million 13 in 2002 as a result of higher state and local taxes increased spending for contract services and joint facility expense 

  

operating income – operating income decreased 120 million 5 to 21 billion in 2003 following an increase of 235 million 12 to 23 billion in 2002 in 2003 revenue growth productivity gains and lower depreciation expense were more than offset by higher fuel prices inflation volume and resource utilization costs in 2002 revenue growth productivity gains and lower fuel prices more than offset inflation increased depreciation expense and higher rail costs due to increased rail volume 

  

nonoperating items – interest expense decreased 58 million 9 and 68 million 10 in 2003 and 2002 respectively the improvement in both years was a result of lower weightedaverage debt levels including the convertible preferred securities of 8939 million 9523 million and 9979 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 as well as lower weightedaverage interest rates of 64 in 2003 66 in 2002 and 70 in 2001 other income fell 246 million in 2003 following an increase of 163 million in 2002 the reduction in 2003 and increase in 2002 were primarily a result of higher 2002 real estate gains 2002 asset sales to the utah transit authority with a pretax value of 141 million and the santa clara valley transit authority with a pretax value of 73 million other income for 2003 was also negatively affected by redemption costs associated with the early retirement of 15 billion of convertible preferred securities income tax expense decreased 99 million 15 in 2003 versus an increase of 135 million 25 in 2002 over 2001 the decrease in 2003 was driven by lower pretax income which was partially offset by a tax adjustment recognized in 2002 for prior years’ income tax examinations the increase in income tax expense for 2002 resulted from higher pretax income in 2002 which was partially offset by the tax adjustment previously mentioned

revenues from discontinued operations were 12 billion 13 billion and 11 billion for 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively revenues for 2003 decreased as a result of the loss of november and december revenues due to the sale of our trucking interest on november 5 2003 the decrease was partially offset by increased volume yield improvements and price improvements the increase in revenues for 2002 was due to volume growth yield improvements and higher revenue for special services partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue as a result of lower fuel prices in 2002 income from discontinued operations was 255 million 76 million and 32 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 income from discontinued operations in 2003 included the net gain from the sale of our trucking interest of 211 million including an income tax benefit of 126 million while 2002 income included a 

  

onetime benefit of 34 million as a result of the resolution of certain tax matters with the internal revenue service which was accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense during the period 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

as of december 31 2003 our principal sources of liquidity included cash cash equivalents the sale of receivables and revolving credit facilities as well as issuance of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets we had 1925 billion of credit facilities available of which there were no borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2003 the sale of receivables program is subject to certain requirements including the maintenance of an investment grade bond rating if our bond rating were to deteriorate it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity receivables sold as of december 31 2003 were 590 million in january 2004 we reduced the outstanding undivided interest held by investors by 30 million to 560 million due to a decrease in available receivables at december 31 2003 access to commercial paper is dependent on market conditions deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to utilize commercial paper as a source of liquidity liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability 

  

at december 31 2003 and 2002 we had a working capital deficit of 367 million and 625 million respectively a working capital deficit is not uncommon in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity we maintain adequate resources to meet our daily cash requirements and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 

  

financial condition 

  

cash from operations was 24 billion 22 billion and 19 billion in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the increase from 2002 to 2003 is due to working capital performance and cash from the discontinued operations partially offset by lower income from continuing operations the increase from 2001 to 2002 was primarily due to higher net income partially offset by pension plan funding 

  

cash used in investing activities was 856 million 13 billion and 14 billion in 2003 2002 and 2001 the reduction in 2003 is primarily driven by proceeds of 620 million from the sale of our trucking interest which was partially offset by lower proceeds from asset sales and increased 2003 capital spending the amount decreased slightly from 2001 to 2002 as higher real estate sales a warranty refund from a vendor and a dividend from an affiliate in 2002 were partially offset by higher capital spending 

  

the table below details capital expenditures for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 including noncash financings of 188 million 126 million and 124 million respectively 

  

   

cash used in financing activities was 14 billion 599 million and 484 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the increase from 2002 to 2003 reflects higher debt repayments of 21 billion in 2003 including 15 billion of convertible preferred securities compared to 12 billion in 2002 and higher dividend payments partially offset by an increase in proceeds from stock option exercises of 66 million the increase from 2001 to 2002 reflects lower financings 648 million in 2002 versus 881 million in 2001 partially offset by an increase in stock option exercise proceeds of 98 million and slightly lower debt repayments 

  

we expect to spend approximately 2 billion on capital expenditures in 2004 including capital leases our 2004 capital expenditures and debt service requirements are expected to be funded through cash generated from operations additional debt financings and the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating properties 

  

including the convertible preferred securities as an equity instrument the ratio of debt to total capital employed was 393 388 and 422 at december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the increase in our ratio in 2003 is due to the redemption of the 15 billion of convertible preferred securities and higher debt levels partially offset by higher equity levels the reduction in 2002 is due to lower debt levels and higher equity balances 

  

for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 32 34 and 26 respectively the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is based on continuing operations earnings represent income before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change less equity in undistributed earnings of unconsolidated affiliates plus fixed charges and income taxes fixed charges represent interest charges amortization of debt discount and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges the change in our ratio is due primarily to the changes in our income from continuing operations 

  

financing activities 

  

credit facilities  we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2003 commercial paper is issued from time to time for working capital needs and is supported by 1925 billion in credit facilities our credit facilities include 925 million of 364day revolving credit facilities expiring in march 2004 and 10 billion of 5year revolving credit facilities expiring in march 2005 we have the option to hold higher cash balances in addition to or in replacement of the credit facilities to support commercial paper these credit facilities also allow for borrowings at floating liborbased rates plus a spread depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings the credit facilities require the maintenance of a minimum net worth and a debt to net worth coverage ratio at december 31 2003 we were in compliance with these covenants the credit facilities do not include any other financial restrictions credit rating triggers other than ratingdependent pricing or any provision that could require the posting of collateral the credit facilities are designated for general corporate purposes and none of the credit facilities were used as of december 31 2003 commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facilities are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investmentgrade borrowers we are reviewing rollover options for the credit facilities 

  

to the extent we have longterm credit facilities available we have reclassified certain shortterm debt on a longterm basis at december 31 2003 and 2002 approximately 324 million and 188 million of shortterm borrowings that we intend to refinance were reclassified as longterm debt this reclassification reflects our intent to refinance these shortterm borrowings and current maturities of longterm debt on a longterm basis through the issuance of commercial paper or new longterm financings or by using the currently available longterm credit facility if alternative financing is not available 

  

redemption of convertible preferred securities  during 2003 we exercised our option to redeem the entire 15 billion of the convertible preferred securities cps the cps were issued in april 1998 by our wholly owned subsidiary union pacific capital trust at a price of 50 each and paid quarterly cash dividends at an annual rate of 6 1  4  the redemption was funded with a combination of cash from operations the issuance of 500 million of debt in june 2003 and cash proceeds from the initial public offering of overnite the 15 billion redemption net of the 500 million debt issuance will reduce interest expense by approximately 71 million pretax annually and eliminate the dilutive effect of the cps on earnings per share total onetime costs incurred in 2003 associated with the redemption were approximately 45 million and are included in other income 

  

shelf registration statement and significant new borrowings  under a current shelf registration statement filed in 2002 we may issue from time to time any combination of debt securities preferred stock common stock or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings during february 2003 under the shelf 

  

registration we issued 250 million of 3 7  8  fixed rate debt with a maturity of february 15 2009 the proceeds of the issuance were used for repayment of debt and other general corporate purposes on june 5 2003 we issued 300 million of 3 5  8  fixed rate debt with a maturity of june 1 2010 and 200 million of 5 3  8  fixed rate debt with a maturity of june 1 2033 the proceeds of the issuance were used to redeem 500 million of cps on july 7 2003 in december 2003 we filed a new 10 billion shelf registration statement which became effective december 29 2003 under this shelf registration statement we may issue from time to time any combination of debt securities preferred stock common stock or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings at december 31 2003 we had 250 million remaining for issuance under the 2002 shelf registration and the full 10 billion for issuance under the new 2003 shelf registration we have no immediate plans to issue equity securities however we will continue to explore opportunities in 2004 to replace existing debt and otherwise access capital through issuances of debt securities under these registrations 

  

during may 2003 we entered into a capital lease covering new locomotives the related capital lease obligation totaled approximately 188 million and is included in the consolidated statements of financial position as debt 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements contractual obligations and commitments 

  

as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements item 8 and as referenced in the tables below we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition however based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments including material sources of offbalance sheet and structured finance arrangements there is no known trend demand commitment event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition the commercial obligations financings and commitments made by us are customary transactions which are similar to those of other comparable industrial corporations particularly within the transportation industry 

  

the following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of december 31 2003 

  

   

     

   

      

sale of receivables – the railroad has sold without recourse on a 364day revolving basis an undivided interest in a designated pool of accounts receivable to investors through union pacific receivables inc upri a bankruptcyremote subsidiary at december 31 2003 and 2002 upri had transferred 695 million and 667 million respectively of accounts receivable to the investors upri subsequently sells an interest in such pool to the investors and retains an undivided interest in a portion of these receivables this retained interest is included in accounts receivable in our consolidated financial statements at december 31 2003 and 2002 upri had a retained interest of 105 million and 67 million respectively the outstanding undivided interest held by investors of 590 million and 600 million at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively is sold at carrying value which approximates fair value and there is no gain or loss recognized from the transaction these sold receivables are no longer included in our consolidated financial statements 

  

on august 7 2003 the program was renewed for one year with a capacity to sell to the investors an undivided interest in accounts receivable of 600 million the amount of receivables sold fluctuates based upon the availability of the amount of receivables eligible for sale and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks including default and dilution if default or dilution percentages were to increase one percentage point the amount of receivables available for sale would decrease by 6 million should our credit rating fall below investment grade the amount of receivables sold would be reduced and in certain cases the investors have the right to discontinue this reinvestment 

  

the investors have designated the railroad to service the sold receivables however no servicing asset or liability has been recognized as the servicing fees adequately compensate the railroad for its responsibilities the costs of the sale of receivables program are included in other income and were 10 million 13 million and 27 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the costs include interest program fees paid to banks commercial paper issuing costs and fees for unused commitment availability payments collected from sold receivables can be reinvested in new receivables on behalf of the buyers proceeds from collections reinvested in the program were approximately 11 billion in both 2003 and 2002 

  

in january 2004 upri reduced the outstanding undivided interest held by investors by 30 million to 560 million due to a decrease in available receivables at december 31 2003 

  

headquarters building  the railroad has a synthetic operating lease arrangement to finance a new headquarters building which is being constructed in omaha nebraska the expected completion date of the building is mid2004 it will total approximately 11 million square feet with approximately 3800 office workspaces the cost to construct the new headquarters including capitalized interest is approximately 260 million we have guaranteed all of the railroad’s obligation under this lease 

  

uprr is the construction agent for the lessor during the construction period the railroad has guaranteed in the event of a loss caused by or resulting from our actions or failures to act as construction agent 899 of the building related construction costs incurred up to that point during the construction period total building related costs incurred and drawn from the lease funding commitments as of december 31 2003 were approximately 125 million accordingly the railroad’s guarantee at december 31 2003 was approximately 113 million as construction continues and additional costs are incurred this guarantee will increase accordingly at december 31 2003 we had a liability recorded of approximately 7 million related to the fair value of this guarantee 

  

after construction is complete uprr will lease the building under an initial term of five years with provisions for renewal for an extended period subject to agreement between the railroad and lessor at any time during the lease the railroad may at its option purchase the building at approximately the amount expended by the lessor to construct the building if the railroad elects not to purchase the building or renew the lease the building is returned to the lessor for remarketing and the railroad has guaranteed a residual value equal to 85 of the total construction related costs the guarantee will be approximately 220 million 

  

other matters 

  

inflation – the cumulative effect of long periods of inflation has significantly increased asset replacement costs for capitalintensive companies as a result assuming that all operating assets are replaced at current price levels depreciation charges on an inflationadjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 

  

derivative financial instruments – we use derivative financial instruments in limited instances for other than trading purposes to manage risk related to changes in fuel prices and to achieve our interest rate objectives we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged both at inception and throughout the hedged period we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items as well as our riskmanagement objectives strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness we use swaps collars futures andor forward contracts to mitigate the downside risk of adverse price movements and hedge the exposure to variable cash flows the use of these instruments also limits future gains from favorable movements we use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate changes the purpose of these programs is to protect our operating margins and overall profitability from adverse fuel price changes or interest rate fluctuations 

  

market and credit risk – we address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying item being hedged credit risk related to derivative financial instruments which is minimal is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements at december 31 2003 we have not been required to provide collateral nor have we received collateral relating to our hedging activities 

  

in addition we enter into secured financings in which the debtor has pledged collateral the collateral is based upon the nature of the financing and the credit risk of the debtor we generally are not permitted to sell or repledge the collateral unless the debtor defaults 

  

determination of fair value – the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions at december 31 2003 and 2002 were determined based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or developed based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the applicable us treasury rate london interbank offered rates libor or swap spread 

  

sensitivity analyses – the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates or fuel prices could have on our results of operations and financial condition these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 

  

interest rates – we manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period the mix of fixed and floating rate debt is largely managed through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as incremental borrowings are required derivatives are used as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix in addition we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixedrate debt securities 

  

at december 31 2003 and 2002 we had variablerate debt representing approximately 10 and 12 respectively of our total debt if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2004 than our december 31 2003 variable rate which was approximately 3 our interest expense would increase by approximately 7 million if variable interest rates averaged one percentage point higher in 2003 than our 2002 annual variable rate which was approximately 3   our interest expense would have increased by approximately 8 million this amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the balances of our variablerate debt at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt’s fair value attributable to the changes in the benchmark interest rate libor the swaps have been accounted for using the shortcut method as allowed by fasb statement no 133 fas 133 therefore no ineffectiveness has been recorded within our consolidated financial statements in march 2003 we entered into an interest rate swap on 250 million of debt with a maturity date of october 2007 in may 2002 we entered into an interest rate swap on 150 million of debt with a maturity date of february 2023 this swap contained a call option that matched the call option of the underlying hedged debt as allowed by fas 133 in january 2003 the swap’s counterparty exercised its option to cancel the swap effective february 1 2003 similarly we exercised our option to redeem the underlying debt as of december 31 2003 and 2002 we had interest rate swaps hedging debt of approximately 818 million and 898 million respectively 

  

market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2003 and amounts to approximately 573 million at december 31 2003 market risk resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2002 amounted to approximately 561 million at december 31 2002 the fair values of our fixedrate debt were estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 

  

fuel – fuel costs are a significant portion of our total operating expenses as a result of the significance of fuel costs and the historical volatility of fuel prices we periodically use swaps collars futures andor forward contracts as well as our fuel surcharge programs to mitigate the impact of adverse fuel price changes 

  

as of december 31 2003 collars are in place for 9 of expected fuel consumption for 2004 the collars have a floor of 064 a cap of 074 and a ceiling of 086 per gallon excluding taxes transportation costs and regional pricing spreads as of december 31 2003 we had no outstanding hedges for 2005 based on annualized fuel consumption during 2003 and excluding the impact of the hedging program each onecent increase in the price of fuel would have resulted in approximately 8 million of additional fuel expense after tax 

  

as of december 31 2002 we hedged approximately 7 of our forecasted 2003 fuel consumption using fuel swaps at 058 per gallon excluding taxes transportation costs and regional pricing spreads 

  

accounting pronouncements – in december 2003 the fasb published a revision to fasb interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” fin 46 to clarify some of the provisions and to exempt certain entities from its requirements under the new guidance special effective date provisions apply to enterprises that have fully or partially applied fin 46 prior to issuance of the revised interpretation we adopted fin 46 in june of 2003 the revision did not require us to modify our accounting related to the implementation of fin 46 

  

network performance  our network performance and operating efficiency were adversely affected in the third and fourth quarters by a shortage of trainmen and engineers combined with an expanded summer track maintenance program and fourth quarter recordlevel volumes additional operating expenses were incurred as crew utilization costs and car cycle times increased due to slower network train speed as discussed under operating expenses in this item 7 labor rent expense and other costs were affected by our network performance programs have been put in place which we believe should remedy the situation including among other things hiring and training additional employees and accelerating certain locomotive acquisitions 

  

commitments and contingencies – there are various claims and lawsuits pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries we are also subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations pursuant to which we are currently participating in the investigation and remediation of various sites

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

shareholder litigation 

  

as previously reported a purported derivative action was filed by nine individuals seven of whom are members of the teamsters on behalf of the corporation on june 21 2001 in the chancery court of shelby county tennessee naming as defendants current and certain former directors of the corporation and various present and former officers and employees of otc as well as otc and as a nominal defendant the corporation the derivative action alleged among other things that the named defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the corporation wasted its assets and mismanaged otc by opposing the efforts of the teamsters to organize the employees of otc plaintiffs claimed that the “antiunion” campaign allegedly waged by the defendants cost millions of dollars and caused a substantial decline in the value of otc on july 31 2001 the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action on various grounds and on july 1 2002 the court granted the defendants’ motion and dismissed the derivative action on procedural grounds the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the tennessee court of appeals and on october 7 2003 the court of appeals affirmed the decision of the chancery court to dismiss the action on procedural grounds during the fourth quarter of 2003 the plaintiffs petitioned the supreme court of tennessee to review the decision of the appellate court the court has not indicated whether it will hear this appeal 

  

environmental matters 

  

the united states attorney for the central district of california has notified us that the office intends to present criminal charges against us for alleged violations of federal environmental laws including the federal clean water act in connection with releases of oil contaminated wastewater from our taylor yard in 2001 and 2003 in addition the state authorities are proposing civil penalties for these same releases in the amount of 125000 

  

after a series of protracted negotiations the california department of toxic substances control “dtsc” threatened civil prosecution against us in november 2003 relating to our failure to register as a hazardous waste transporter under california law from april 2000 to august 2001 we contend that we are exempt from the registration requirements due to federal preemption the dtsc has proposed civil penalties of 125160 for the alleged violation we will vigorously oppose this proposed penalty 

  

as previously reported in our annual report on form 10k for 2001 on january 30 2002 the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq issued to the railroad a notice of a proposed penalty assessment in the amount of 195700 we previously met with the ldeq regarding this matter to present documentation indicating that no penalty should be assessed we have filed suit against the ldeq in louisiana state district court challenging the penalty the ldeq proposed penalty relates to the derailment of one of our trains carrying hazardous materials near eunice louisiana on may 27 2000 the derailment caused a fire and explosion that resulted in the evacuation of approximately 3800 residents of the surrounding area and numerous claims for personal injuries property damage and business interruption which was previously reported in our report on form 10q for the period ended june 30 2000 to date several class action claims have been filed against the railroad the amount of damages have not been specified in these claims and therefore it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these proceedings settlement discussions with the class representatives are ongoing we believe we have substantial defenses and although losses have exceeded selfinsured retention amounts we believe our insurance coverage is adequate to cover any material damage claims or settlements 

  

as previously reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2002 a criminal case relating to a series of alleged releases of hazardous materials was filed against us by the district attorneys of merced madera and stanislaus counties the criminal case was dismissed in the last quarter of 2003 and was subsequently refiled as a civil action by several counties the civil suit seeks civil penalties against us in connection with the release of calcium oxide “lime” which leaked from an unidentified railcar between chowchilla and sacramento california on december 27 2001 and another incident in which lime leaked from a railcar between chowchilla and stockton california on february 21 2002 the suit contends that regulatory violations occurred by virtue of our alleged failure to timely report the release of a “hazardous material” our alleged disposal of hazardous waste and the alleged release of material into the waters of the state of california the amount of the claim is not specified but could exceed 100000 

  

as previously reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended march 31 2003 the san joaquin county district attorney filed an action against us on february 3 2003 alleging claims under the california business and professions code section 17200 unfair business practices fish and game code section 5650 and 56501 california health and safety code section 25189d and public nuisance california civil code section 3480 the claims arise from a february 16 2000 derailment in stockton california in which a locomotive struck an object on the tracks resulting in the puncture of a fuel tank the district attorney alleged that diesel fuel from this spill entered waters of the state of california the complaint also asserted claims under the above referenced statutes for any other diesel spill which may have occurred in the state of california between 2000 and 2003 in which diesel may have passed into waters of the state of california and seeks injunctive relief as well as civil penalties of 25000 for the alleged february 16 2000 diesel spill and total penalties of not less than 250000 for all diesel spills which may have occurred since 2000 the district attorney filed an amended complaint on april 10 2003 which narrowed the claims to the incident of february 16 2000 the amended complaint seeks both injunctive relief and daily penalties which could exceed 100000 for each day that fuel was in the affected waterway 

  

as previously reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended march 31 2002 on april 26 2002 we received written notice of a proposed 250000 penalty from the illinois environmental protection agency relating to a collision between trains from conrail and the railroad the collision occurred near momence illinois on march 23 1999 when an eastbound conrail train failed to stop at a signal and struck a uprr train that was properly occupying a crossing the collision resulted in a release of diesel fuel from the fuel tanks of our locomotive which was promptly reported and remediated we received notice in january 2003 that the amount of the proposed penalty including oversight costs has been reduced to 127000 we will vigorously oppose this proposed penalty 

  

we have received notices from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are or may be liable under certain federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the united states including sites which are on the superfund national priorities list or state superfund lists 

  

although specific claims have been made by the epa and state regulators with respect to some of these sites the ultimate impact of these proceedings and suits by third parties cannot be predicted at this time because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites andor the speculative nature of remediation costs

rail

operations  the railroad is a class i railroad that operates in the united
states it has over 33000 route miles linking pacific coast and gulf coast
ports to the midwest and eastern united states gateways and providing several
northsouth corridors to key mexican gateways the railroad serves the western
twothirds of the country and maintains coordinated schedules with other
carriers for the handling of freight to and from the atlantic coast the pacific
coast the southeast the southwest canada and mexico export and import
traffic is moved through gulf coast and pacific coast ports and across the
mexican and canadian borders railroad freight is comprised of six commodity
lines agricultural automotive chemicals energy industrial products and
intermodal the railroad continues to focus on utilization of its capital asset
base to meet current operating needs and to introduce innovative rail services
across every commodity line

   the railroad is subject to price and service competition from other
railroads motor carriers and barge operators the railroads main competitor is
burlington northern santa fe corporation its rail subsidiary the burlington
northern and santa fe railway company bnsf operates parallel routes in many
of the railroads main traffic corridors in addition the railroads operations
are conducted in corridors served by other competing railroads and by motor
carriers motor carrier competition is particularly strong for intermodal
traffic because of the proximity of the railroads routes to major inland and
gulf coast waterways barge competition can be particularly pronounced
especially for grain and bulk commodities

employees  approximately 87 of the railroads nearly 47000 employees are
represented by 14 major rail unions national negotiations under the railway
labor act to revise the national labor agreements for all crafts began in late
1999 in may 2001 the brotherhood of maintenance of way employees bmwe
ratified a fiveyear agreement which included provisions for an annual wage
increase based on the consumer price index and progressive health and welfare
cost sharing in august 2002 the carriers reached a five year agreement with
the united transportation union utu for annual wage increases as follows 40
july 2002 25 july 2003 and 30 july 2004 the agreement also established a
process for resolving the health and welfare cost sharing issue through
arbitration and also provided for the operation of remote control locomotives by
trainmen the brotherhood of locomotive engineers ble challenged the remote
control feature of the utu agreement and a recent arbitration decision held that
operation of remote control by utu members in terminals does not violate the ble
agreement in november 2002 the international brotherhood of boilermakers and
blacksmiths ibb reached a five year agreement following the utu wage pattern
in january 2003 an arbitration award was rendered establishing wage increases
and health and welfare employee cost sharing for the transportation
communications international union tcu contract discussions with the
remaining unions are either in negotiation or mediation also during 2002 the
national mediation board ruled against the utu on its petition for a single
operating craft on the kansas city southern railroad the ble is now working on
a possible merger with the international brotherhood of teamsters teamsters

trucking

operations  the trucking segment includes the operations of otc and motor
cargo otc is a major interstate trucking company specializing in
lessthantruckload ltl shipments otc serves all 50 states and portions of
canada and mexico through 170 service centers located throughout the united
states providing regional interregional and long haul service otc transports
a variety of products including machinery tobacco textiles plastics
electronics and paper products motor cargo is a western regional ltl carrier
that provides comprehensive service throughout 10 western states motor cargo
transports general commodities including consumer goods packaged foodstuffs
industrial and electronic equipment and auto parts otc and motor cargo
experience intense service and price competition from regional interregional
and national ltl carriers and to a lesser extent from truckload carriers
railroads and overnight delivery companies major competitors include us
freightways and cnf inc otc and motor cargo believe they are able to compete
effectively in their markets by providing high quality customized service at
competitive prices

employees  during 2002 otc continued to oppose the efforts of the teamsters to
unionize otc service centers on february 11 2002 the united states court of
appeals for the fourth circuit sitting as a full panel refused to enforce four
bargaining orders issued by the national labor relations board nlrb that would
have required otc to bargain with the teamsters even though the teamsters lost
secret ballot elections subsequently the nlrb moved for a judgment against
itself to reverse the seven other bargaining orders it had issued and the
fourth circuit entered that judgment on october 11 2002 the nlrbs general
counsel dismissed a charge the teamsters had filed in august 2001 alleging that
otc had been bargaining in bad faith otc has not reached any collective
bargaining agreement with the teamsters on october 24 2002 the teamsters
ended the national strike they had called against otc three years earlier

page


   the teamsters eightyear campaign to organize otcs service centers has
become almost entirely dormant and since october 2002 the teamsters have lost
rights to represent 41 of the approximately 2100 employees they had organized
the teamsters had become the bargaining representative of the employees at 26 of
otcs 170 service centers but the employees at 17 of these locations recently
have voted to decertify the teamsters and the nlrb has officially approved the
votes in 14 of those locations decertification petitions are pending at four
other service centers only a single representation petition currently is
pending but due to strike violence charges pending against the teamsters the
nlrb has blocked the teamsters efforts to precipitate an election in all the
teamsters currently represent approximately 10 of otcs 12534 employees

   employees at two motor cargo service centers located in north salt lake utah
and reno nevada representing approximately 11 of motor cargos total work
force at 33 service centers are covered by two separate collective bargaining
agreements with unions affiliated with the teamsters although the agreements
cover most of the employees at these two facilities less than half of these
covered employees are actual members of unions

other  included in the other product lines are the results of the corporate
holding company selfinsurance activities technology companies and all
appropriate consolidating entries

other information

regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board stb of the united
states department of transportation dot and other federal and state agencies
the operations of the railroad are also subject to the regulations of the
federal railroad administration of the dot the stb has jurisdiction over rates
charged on certain regulated rail traffic freight car compensation transfer
extension or abandonment of rail lines and acquisition of control of rail
common carriers

   the dot and the occupational safety and health administration along with
other federal agencies have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety
movement of hazardous materials movement and disposal of hazardous waste and
equipment standards various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over
disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials
in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law

environmental regulation  upc and its subsidiaries are subject to various
environmental statutes and regulations including the resource conservation and
recovery act rcra the comprehensive environmental response compensation and
liability act of 1980 cercla and the clean air act caa

   rcra applies to hazardous waste generators and transporters as well as to
persons engaged in treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and specifies
standards for storage areas treatment units and land disposal units all
generators of hazardous waste are required to label shipments in accordance with
detailed regulations and to prepare a detailed manifest identifying the material
and stating its destination before waste can be released for offsite transport
the transporter must deliver the hazardous waste in accordance with the manifest
and only to a treatment storage or disposal facility qualified for rcra interim
status or having a final rcra permit

   the environmental protection agency epa regulations under rcra have
established a comprehensive system for the management of hazardous waste these
regulations identify a wide range of industrial byproducts and residues as
hazardous waste and specify requirements for management of such waste from the
time of generation through the time of disposal and beyond states that have
adopted hazardous waste management programs with standards at least as stringent
as those promulgated by the epa may be authorized by the epa to administer all
or part of rcra on behalf of the epa

   cercla was designed to establish a strategy for cleaning up facilities at
which hazardous waste or other hazardous substances have created actual or
potential environmental hazards the epa has designated certain facilities as
requiring


                                        5
page


cleanup or further assessment among other things cercla authorizes the federal
government either to clean up such facilities itself or to order persons
responsible for the situation to do so the act created a multibillion dollar
fund to be used by the federal government to pay for such cleanup efforts in
the event the federal government pays for such cleanup it will seek
reimbursement from private parties upon which cercla imposes liability

   cercla imposes strict liability on the owners and operators of facilities in
which hazardous waste and other hazardous substances are deposited or from which
they are released or are likely to be released into the environment it also
imposes strict liability on the generators of such waste and the transporters of
the waste who select the disposal or treatment sites liability may include
cleanup costs incurred by third persons and damage to publicly owned natural
resources the corporation is subject to potential liability under cercla as an
owner or operator of facilities at which hazardous substances have been disposed
of or as a generator or a transporter of hazardous substances disposed of at
other locations some states have enacted and other states are considering
enacting legislation similar to cercla certain provisions of these acts are
more stringent than cercla states that have passed such legislation are
currently active in designating more facilities as requiring cleanup and further
assessment

   the operations of the corporation are subject to the requirements of the caa
the 1990 amendments to the caa include a provision under title v requiring that
certain facilities obtain operating permits epa regulations require all states
to develop federallyapprovable permit programs affected facilities must submit
air operating permit applications to the respective states within one year of
the epas approval of the state programs certain of the corporations
facilities may be required to obtain such permits in addition in december
1997 the epa issued final regulations which require that certain purchased and
remanufactured locomotives meet stringent emissions criteria while the cost of
meeting these requirements may be significant expenditures are not expected to
materially affect the corporations financial condition or results of
operations

   the operations of the corporation are also subject to other laws protecting
the environment including permit requirements for wastewater discharges
pursuant to the national pollutant discharge elimination system and stormwater
runoff regulations under the federal water pollution control act

   information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated
remediation costs is set forth in managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations  other matters  environmental
costs item 7 and in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements item 8

risk factors

competition  the corporation is subject to price and service competition from
other railroads which operate parallel routes in many of uprrs traffic
corridors in addition to operations providing other modes of transportation
including motor carriers ships barges and pipelines competition is based
primarily upon the rate charged and the transit time required as well as the
quality and reliability of the service provided while the railroad must build
or acquire and maintain its rail system trucks and barges are able to use
public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or
expenditures materially increasing the quality of these alternative modes of
transportation in the locations in which the railroad operates or legislation
granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or
weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on the results of
operations financial condition and liquidity

governmental regulation  the corporation is subject to governmental regulation
by a significant number of federal state and local regulatory authorities with
respect to both the railroad and trucking operations and a variety of health
safety labor environmental and other matters failure to comply with
applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the
financial statements regulatory authorities may change the legislative
framework within which the corporation operates without providing the
corporation any recourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on the
business also some of the regulations require the corporation to obtain and
maintain various licenses permits and other authorizations and the corporation
cannot assure that it will continue to be able to do so

environmental laws and regulations  the corporations operations are subject to
extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations
concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to water and
the handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials
and cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases environmental liability
can extend to previously owned or operated properties leased properties and
properties owned by third parties as well as to properties currently owned and
used environmental liabilities may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent
landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation the corporation may
be subject to



                                        6
page


allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated or is strictly
liable under these laws or regulations the corporation could incur significant
costs as a result of any of the foregoing and may be required to incur
significant expenses to investigate and remediate environmental contamination

fuel costs  fuel costs constitute a significant portion of transportation
expenses diesel fuel prices are subject to dramatic fluctuations significant
price increases may have a material adverse effect on the corporations
operating results additionally fuel prices and supplies are influenced
significantly by international political and economic circumstances if a fuel
supply shortage were to arise from opec production curtailments a disruption of
oil imports or otherwise higher fuel prices and any subsequent price increases
would materially affect the corporations results of operations financial
condition and liquidity

labor unions  the corporation is a party to collective bargaining agreements
and ongoing negotiations with various labor unions in the united states
disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or the corporations
potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could
result in among other things strikes work stoppages or other slowdowns by the
affected workers if the unionized workers were to engage in a strike work
stoppage or other slowdown or other employees were to become unionized or the
terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated the
corporation could experience a significant disruption of its operations and
higher ongoing labor costs

general economic conditions  several of the commodities transported by both the
railroad and trucking segments come from industries with cyclical business
operations as a result prolonged negative changes in domestic and global
economic conditions affecting the producers and consumers of the commodities
carried by the corporation may have an adverse effect on the results of
operations financial condition and liquidity

weather  severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including
earthquakes and floods may cause significant business interruptions and result
in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues which could have an
adverse effect on the results of operations financial condition and liquidity

supplier risk  the corporation is dependent on two key suppliers of
locomotives due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of this
equipment there are strong barriers of entry to new suppliers therefore if
one of these suppliers would no longer produce locomotives the corporation
could realize a significant increase in the cost and the potential for reduced
availability of the locomotives that are necessary to its operations

claims and lawsuits  the nature of the corporations business exposes it to the
potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment
personal injury and occupational illness property damage environmental and
other matters therefore the corporation may be subject to claims or litigation
that could involve significant expenditures

future acts of terrorism or war or risk of war  terrorist attacks such as
those that occurred on september 11 2001 any government response thereto and
war or risk of war may adversely affect the corporations results of operations
financial condition the ability to raise capital or the corporations future
growth the corporations rail lines and facilities could be direct targets or
indirect casualties of an act or acts of terror which could cause significant
business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and
decreased revenues which could have an adverse effect on the operating results
and financial condition any act of terror retaliatory strike sustained
military campaign or war or risk of war may have an adverse impact on the
operating results and financial condition by causing or resulting in
unpredictable operating or financial conditions including disruptions of rail
lines volatility or sustained increase of fuel prices fuel shortages general
economic decline and instability or weakness of financial markets which could
restrict the corporations ability to raise capital in addition insurance
premiums charged for some or all of the coverages currently maintained by the
corporation could increase dramatically or certain coverages may not be
available in the future









item 2 properties

the corporations primary real estate equipment and other property properties
are owned or leased to support its rail and trucking operations the corporation
believes that its properties are in good condition and adequate for current
operations the rail and trucking segments operate facilities and equipment
designated for both the maintenance and repair of their respective property

item 3 legal proceedings

shareholder litigation

as previously reported a purported derivative action was filed by nine
individuals seven of whom are members of the teamsters on behalf of the
corporation on june 21 2001 in the chancery court of shelby county tennessee
naming as defendants current and certain former directors of the corporation and
various present and former officers and employees of otc as well as otc and
as a nominal defendant the corporation the derivative action alleged among
other things that the named defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the
corporation wasted its assets and mismanaged otc by opposing the efforts of the
teamsters to organize the employees of otc plaintiffs claimed that the
antiunion campaign allegedly waged by the defendants cost millions of dollars
and caused a substantial decline in the value of otc on july 31 2001 the
defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action on various grounds and on july
1 2002 the court granted the defendants motion and dismissed the derivative
action on procedural grounds the plaintiffs have filed an appeal with the
tennessee court of appeals the corporation and the defendants will vigorously
defend this appeal and any other efforts by the plaintiffs

environmental matters

as previously reported in the corporations quarterly report on form 10q for
the quarter ended june 30 2000 a uprr train carrying hazardous materials
derailed on may 27 2000 near eunice louisiana resulting in the evacuation of
approximately 3500 residents of the surrounding area and numerous claims for
personal injury property damage and business interruption following the
incident forty lawsuits were filed in various courts and thirtyeight of those
cases were consolidated in the united states district court for the district of
western louisiana the remaining two cases were filed in the state district
court in baton rouge louisiana and are being coordinated with the federal
cases after the federal district court certified a class of over 20000
potential claimants the railroad appealed to the unites states court of appeals
for the fifth circuit the plaintiffs agreed to stay the appeal to facilitate
settlement negotiations which are ongoing while it is not possible to predict
the ultimate outcome of these proceedings the railroad believes it has
substantial defenses although losses exceed the selfinsured retention amounts
the railroad believes its insurance coverage is adequate to cover material
damage claims or settlement amounts

   as previously reported in the corporations annual report on form 10k for
2001 on january 30 2002 the louisiana department of environmental quality
ldeq issued to the railroad a notice of a proposed penalty assessment in the
amount of 195700 in connection with the release of water potentially impacted
by the derailment of a train near eunice louisiana as discussed above the
railroad previously met with the ldeq regarding this matter to present
documentation indicating that no penalty should be assessed the railroad has
filed suit against the ldeq in louisiana state district court challenging the
penalty

   as previously reported in the corporations quarterly report on form 10q for
the quarter ended june 30 2002 the district attorneys of merced madera and
stanislaus counties in the state of california threatened to file criminal
charges against the railroad in connection with the release of calcium oxide
lime which leaked from an unidentified railcar between

page


chowchilla and sacramento california on december 27 2001 and another
incident in which lime leaked from a railcar between chowchilla and stockton
california on february 21 2002 on december 20 2002 the district attorney of
stanislaus county filed criminal charges against the railroad and on december
23 2002 the district attorneys of merced and madera counties filed criminal
charges against the railroad relating to these incidents they contend that
criminal violations occurred by virtue of the alleged failure by the railroad to
timely report the release of a hazardous material its alleged disposal of
hazardous waste and the alleged release of material into the waters of the state
of california the district attorneys of san joaquin and sacramento counties are
still evaluating these incidents as well as other alleged releases the
railroad disputes both the factual and legal bases for these claims and intends
to vigorously defend any action that might be filed

   as previously reported in the corporations quarterly report on form 10q for
the quarter ended september 30 2002 the united states environmental protection
agency region 9 has filed two administrative complaints against uprr the
first of which alleges that the railroad violated the clean water act in 1997 by
discharging dredged or fill materials into the carpenteria salt marsh in santa
barbara county california and seeks civil penalties from the railroad in an
amount up to 137500 the second complaint alleges that the railroad violated
the clean water act in 1999 by discharging dredged or fill materials into laguna
creek in santa barbara county california without a section 404 permit and
likewise seeks civil penalties up to 137500 uprr disputes the allegations set
forth in these complaints and intends to defend the matters in any subsequent
administrative proceedings

   as previously reported in the corporations quarterly report on form 10q for
the quarter ended september 30 2002 the south coast air quality management
district has filed an action against the railroad in the los angeles county
superior court in which it seeks civil penalties in an amount up to 225000
from the railroad the complaint alleges that the railroad has violated certain
provisions of the california health and safety code and district rules as a
result of air emissions from idling diesel locomotives in los angeles
california the complaint further alleges that the railroad has violated the
california health and safety code and district rules as a result of fugitive
dust emissions from railroad property located in colton california the
railroad disputes the allegations of the complaint and maintains that the claims
relating to idling locomotives are preempted by federal law the railroad has
reached an agreement to settle these claims for a payment of 25500 in
penalties

   as previously reported in the corporations quarterly report on form 10q for
the quarter ended march 31 2002 on april 26 2002 uprr received written
notice of a proposed 250000 penalty from the illinois environmental protection
agency relating to a collision between trains from conrail and the railroad the
collision occurred near momence illinois on march 23 1999 when an eastbound
conrail train failed to stop at a signal and struck a uprr train that was
properly occupying a crossing the collision resulted in a release of diesel
fuel from the fuel tanks of a union pacific locomotive which was promptly
reported and remediated the railroad received notice in january 2003 that the
amount of the proposed penalty including oversight costs has been reduced to
127000 the railroad will vigorously oppose this proposed penalty

   the corporation and its affiliates have received notices from the epa and
state environmental agencies alleging that they are or may be liable under
certain federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various
sites throughout the united states including sites which are on the superfund
national priorities list or state superfund lists although specific claims have
been made by the epa and state regulators with respect to some of these sites
the ultimate impact of these proceedings and suits by third parties cannot be
predicted at this time because of the number of potentially responsible parties
involved the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and
quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites andor the speculative
nature of remediation costs nevertheless at many of the superfund sites the
corporation believes it will have little or no exposure because no liability
should be imposed under applicable law one or more other financially able
parties generated all or most of the contamination or a settlement of the
corporations exposure has been reached although regulatory proceedings at the
sites involved have not been formally terminated

   information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated
remediation costs is set forth in managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations  other matters  environmental
costs item 7 and in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements item 8

other matters

as previously reported western resources inc western filed a complaint on
january 24 2000 in the us district court for the district of kansas alleging
that uprr and the burlington northern and santa fe railway company bnsf


                                       10

materially breached their service obligations under the transportation contract
to deliver coal in a timely manner to westerns jeffrey energy center the
original complaint sought recovery of consequential damages and termination of
the contract excusing western from further performance in an amended complaint
filed september 1 2000 western claimed the right to retroactive termination
and added a claim for restitution the matter went to trial before a jury on
august 20 2002 on september 12 2002 the jury returned a verdict finding that
the contract had not been breached by the railroads and the judgment dismissing
the case was entered by the court on september 16 2002 western filed a motion
for new trial on september 30 2002 which the railroads believe will be
unsuccessful uprr and bnsf filed a response opposing the motion for a new trial
on october 15 2002 and western filed its reply on october 28 2002 uprr and
bnsf will vigorously defend this and all other posttrial efforts by western to
overturn the jury verdict

critical accounting policies

the corporations discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results
of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires
estimation and judgment that affect


                                       15
page


the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities the
corporation bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the
following are the corporations critical accounting policies that affect
significant areas of the corporations operations and involve judgment and
estimates if these estimates differ materially from actual results the impact
on the consolidated financial statements may be material

depreciation  provisions for depreciation are computed principally on the
straightline method based on estimated service lives of depreciable property
the cost net of salvage of depreciable rail property retired or replaced in
the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation various
methods are used to estimate useful lives for each group of depreciable
property due to the capital intensive nature of the business and the large base
of depreciable assets variances to those estimates could have a material effect
on the corporations consolidated financial statements

environmental  the corporation generates and transports hazardous and
nonhazardous waste in its current and former operations and is subject to
federal state and local environmental laws and regulations the corporation has
identified approximately 433 sites at which it is or may be liable for
remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of
environmental requirements this includes 52 sites that are the subject of
actions taken by the us government 27 of which are currently on the superfund
national priorities list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several
liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently the
corporations ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to
activities of other parties in addition to costs relating to its own activities
at each site

   when an environmental issue has been identified with respect to the property
owned leased or otherwise used in the conduct of the corporations business
the corporation and its consultants perform environmental assessments on such
property the corporation expenses the cost of the assessments as incurred the
corporation accrues the cost of remediation where its obligation is probable and
such costs can be reasonably estimated

   the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites
as well as for ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated recoveries
from third parties cost estimates are based on information available for each
site financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and existing
technology laws and regulations the corporation believes that it has
adequately accrued for its ultimate share of costs at sites subject to joint and
several liability however the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult
to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved
sitespecific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible
parties the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality
of volumetric data related to many of the sites andor the speculative nature
of remediation costs

income taxes  the corporation accounts for income taxes in accordance with
statement of financial accounting standards no 109 accounting for income
taxes fas 109 the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize
the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax
liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been
recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns these expected
future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently
enacted the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated future
tax law changes such as a change in the corporate tax rate could have a
material impact on the corporations financial position or its results of
operations

pension and postretirement benefits  the corporation incurs certain
employmentrelated expenses associated with pensions and postretirement health
benefits in order to measure the expense associated with these benefits
management must make various estimates and assumptions including discount rates
used to value liabilities assumed rates of return on plan assets compensation
increases employee turnover rates anticipated mortality rates and expected
future healthcare costs the estimates used by management are based on the
corporations historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances
the corporation uses thirdparty actuaries to assist management in properly
measuring the expense and liability associated with these benefits actual
future results that vary from the previously mentioned assumptions could have a
material impact on the consolidated financial statements

   recent declines in the equity markets have caused the market value of the
plan assets to decrease as a result a minimum pension liability adjustment of
225 million net of tax was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2002 as a
reduction to shareholders equity see note 7 to the consolidated financial
statements item 8 also during 2002 the corporation decreased its assumed
longterm rate of return on pension plan assets from 10 to 9 this assumption
change resulted


                                       16
page


in a 22 million increase to 2002 pension expense while the interest rate and
asset return environment have significantly impacted the funded status of the
corporations plans the corporation does not have any minimum pension funding
requirements as set forth in employee benefit and tax laws

personal injury and occupational illness  the cost of injuries to employees and
others related to railroad activities or in accidents involving the trucking
segment is charged to expense based on actuarial estimates of the ultimate cost
and number of incidents each year compensation for railroad workrelated
accidents is governed by the federal employers liability act fela under
fela damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or
outofcourt settlements the railroad offers a comprehensive variety of
services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work
changes in estimates can vary due to evolving trends in litigation related to
personal injury and occupational illness cases based on large jury awards and
public pressures associated with certain occupational related injuries

2002 compared to 2001 results of operations

consolidated

net income  the corporation reported net income of 134 billion 532 per
basic share and 505 per diluted share in 2002 compared to 966 million 390
per basic share and 377 per diluted share in 2001 the increase in net income
resulted from double digit operating income growth lower interest costs two
large asset sale transactions one with the utah transit authority uta for
141 million pretax and one with the santa clara valley transportation
authority vta for 73 million pretax and tax adjustments of 67 million for
prior years income tax examinations operating income improved as revenue
growth lower fuel prices and productivity gains offset the effects of wage and
benefit inflation and higher volumerelated costs productivity is measured by
both gross ton miles per inflationadjusted expense dollar and gross ton miles
per employee

operating revenues  operating revenues increased 518 million 4 to a record
125 billion in 2002 reflecting 3 growth at the railroad and 17 growth in
the trucking segment including the impact of the motor cargo acquisition
excluding motor cargo revenue growth was 5 in the trucking segment the
corporation recognizes transportation revenues on a percentageofcompletion
basis as freight moves from origin to destination other revenue is recognized
as service is performed or contractual obligations are met

operating expenses  operating expenses increased 266 million 3 to 102
billion in 2002 from 99 billion in 2001 excluding motor cargo in 2002 and
2001 operating expenses increased 144 million 1 the increase in expenses
reflects wage and benefit inflation higher equipment rents and depreciation
expenses and increased purchased services and other costs these increases were
partially offset by a 3 reduction in employment levels at the railroad lower
fuel prices and cost control efforts lower fuel prices for the railroad of 73
cents per gallon in 2002 versus 88 cents per gallon in 2001 reduced fuel
expense by 198 million in 2002

   salaries wages and employee benefits increased 225 million 5 compared to
2001 excluding motor cargo expenses increased 156 million 4 compared to
2001 as wage and benefit inflation and volume costs exceeded savings from lower
employment levels and improved productivity equipment and other rents expense
increased 59 million 5 as a result of a 2 increase in carloads additional
locomotive lease expense and higher contract maintenance costs recognized at
overnite depreciation expense increased 32 million 3 as a result of the
railroads capital spending in recent years which has increased the total value
of the corporations assets subject to depreciation fuel and utilities costs
were down 183 million 14 compared to 2001 due to lower fuel prices and a
lower fuel consumption rate partially offset by higher gross ton miles at the
railroad materials and supplies expense decreased 7 million 1 primarily due
to reduced locomotive repairs partly offset by increased freight car repairs
casualty costs increased 38 million 10 over 2001 due to higher personal
injury and increased insurance costs purchased services and other costs
increased 102 million 11 primarily due to an increase in outsourcing of
locomotive contract maintenance services as well as an increase in jointly
owned facility expenses and state and local taxes

operating income  operating income increased 252 million 12 to a record
23 billion in 2002 as revenue growth productivity gains and lower fuel
prices more than offset inflation increased depreciation expense and higher
rail costs due to increased rail volume

nonoperating items  interest expense decreased 68 million 10 compared to
2001 due to lower weightedaverage debt levels and weightedaverage interest
rates in 2002 in 2002 the corporations weightedaverage debt level including
the convertible preferred securities decreased from 9980 million in 2001 to
9525 million in 2002 the corporations weightedaverage interest rate was
67 in 2002 as compared to 70 in 2001 other income increased 163 million in
2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to the asset sale transactions with the uta
and vta income tax expense increased 108 million 19 in 2002 over 2001 as a
result of higher pretax income levels in 2002 which was partially offset by tax
adjustments for prior years

key measures  net income as a percentage of operating revenues increased to
107 in 2002 from 81 in 2001 return on average common shareholders equity
was 133 in 2002 up from 106 in 2001 the corporations operating margin was
186 in 2002 compared to 173 in 2001 the corporations operating margin
excluding overnite for 2002 was 202 compared to 186 in 2001

rail segment

net income  rail operations reported net income of 137 billion in 2002
compared to 106 billion in 2001 up 30 the increase in earnings resulted
from stronger operating results the asset sale transactions with the uta and
vta lower interest costs and a tax adjustment for prior years income tax
examinations higher operating revenue and lower fuel expense combined with
productivity gains and cost control efforts offset inflation and higher
volumerelated costs

operating revenues  operating revenue is comprised of commodity revenue and
other revenues other revenues primarily include subsidiary revenue from various
nonrailroad companies that are wholly owned or majority owned by the railroad
revenue from the chicago commuter rail operations and accessorial revenue earned
due to customer detainment of railroad owned or controlled equipment rail
operating revenues increased 303 million 3 over 2001 to a record 111
billion revenue carloads increased 2 primarily driven by growth in the
automotive intermodal and chemicals commodity groups other revenue increased
31 million 8 due to increased passenger subsidiary and accessorial
revenues

agricultural  revenue increased 4 due to a 1 increase in carloads coupled
with a 3 increase in average revenue per car meals and oils carloads increased
due to strong export demand and more shipments to mexico corn shipments to
mexico also increased revenue gains were also achieved through increased
shipments of cottonseed ethanol used as a fuel additive and frozen french
fries average revenue per car increased due to a higher average length of haul
resulting from fewer shorthaul empty storage moves and corn processor shipments
combined with increased longhaul meals and oils and animal feed shipments

automotive  revenue increased 8 as a result of a 7 increase in carloads and
a 1 increase in average revenue per car volume growth resulted from market
share gains for finished vehicles where carloads were up 11 despite a decline
in us light vehicle sales materials shipments declined 1 due primarily to
reduced production in mexico market share gains partially offset the decline
average revenue per car increased due to a shift in mix of carloads shipped
resulting from increased higher average revenue per car vehicles shipments and a
decline in lower average revenue per car materials shipments in addition
average length of haul for vehicle shipments increased

chemicals  revenue increased 2 as a result of a 3 increase in carloads and a
1 decrease in average revenue per car volume increased for liquid and dry
chemicals due to relatively higher economic demand from industrial
manufacturers plastics shipments rose as a result of increased demand for
consumer durables revenue also increased due to higher domestic demand for
fertilizer and demand for domestic and export soda ash shipments average
revenue per car declined due to changes in customer contract terms

energy  energy commodity revenue decreased 2 as average revenue per car
declined 3 records were set for total carloads and coal trains loaded per day
in the southern powder river basin in wyoming results were achieved through
favorable weather conditions and improved cycle times offsetting the volume
increase were reduced west coast export shipments originating from the colorado
and utah mining regions average revenue per car declined due to the impact of
contract price negotiations on expiring longterm contracts with certain major
customers

industrial products  revenue increased 3 due to a slight increase in carloads
coupled with a 3 increase in average revenue per car increased lumber
shipments were the primary growth driver due to strong housing construction and
greater production in the pacific northwest region stone shipments increased
due to strong building and road construction activity in the south revenue also
increased for paper and newsprint commodities due to higher general demand
reduced shipments of steel and metallic shipments in the first three quarters
partially offset these increases however steel shipments rebounded in the
fourth quarter as new us tariffs made domestic producers more
pricecompetitive with foreign producers average revenue per car increased due
to price increases and a greater mix of longer average length of haul

intermodal  revenue increased 5 primarily due to a 4 increase in carloads
volumes increased due to higher international shipments resulting from strong
import demand and market share gains in some segments these gains were
partially offset by the labor dispute between the international longshoreman and
warehouse union ilwu and the pacific maritime association which had a
significant impact on intermodal volumes during the fourth quarter primarily in
october revenue declined for domestic shipments due to soft market demand and
the voluntary action of shedding lowmargin trailer business in favor of
highermargin containers the slight increase in average revenue per car was the
result of price increases offset by the mix impact of more lower revenue per
car international shipments

mexico business  in 2002 and 2001 respectively uprr generated 873 million
and 860 million of revenues from rail traffic with businesses located in
mexico which is included in the rail commodity revenue reported above
shipments increased for agricultural products chemicals and industrial
products commodity groups increased revenue for agricultural products resulted
from higher corn and meal exports as well as increased beer imports increased
chemicals business consisted of plastics exports in addition to higher imports
and exports of liquid and dry chemicals the increase in industrial products
resulted from higher imports and exports of steel and scrap and exports of pulp
and paper products reduced automobile production partially offset these gains
resulting in fewer shipments of parts and finished vehicles

operating expenses  operating expenses increased 51 million 1 to 88
billion in 2002 the increase in expense is primarily due to inflation
increased volumerelated costs contract services casualty and depreciation
expense partially offset by savings from lower employee force levels cost
control efforts and significantly lower fuel prices


                                       19
page


salaries wages and employee benefits  salaries wages and employee benefits
increased 76 million 2 in 2002 to 36 billion increases were driven by
inflation and volumerelated costs related to a 4 increase in gross ton miles
a 3 reduction in employee force levels in conjunction with worker productivity
improvements partially offset the inflation and higher volumerelated costs

equipment and other rents  equipment and other rents primarily includes rental
expense the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private
companies freight car intermodal and locomotive leases other specialty
equipped vehicle leases and office and other rentals expenses increased 24
million 2 compared to 2001 due primarily to higher locomotive leases and
volumerelated costs partially offset by savings from lower car cycle times
the average number of accumulated days per load or cycle that loaded and empty
cars from other railroads spend on uprrs system and rental prices for private
cars the higher locomotive lease expense is due to the railroads increased
leasing of new more reliable and fuel efficient locomotives these new
locomotives replaced older nonleased models in the fleet which helped reduce
expenses for depreciation labor materials and fuel during the year the
increase in volume costs is primarily due to increased shipments of finished
autos that almost exclusively utilize rented freight cars the reduction in car
cycle times is attributable to increased volume demand and better car
utilization

depreciation  the majority of depreciation relates to track structure
including rail ties and other track material depreciation expense increased
19 million 2 over 2001 as a result of higher capital spending in recent
years capital spending totaled 18 billion in 2002 and 17 billion in 2001

fuel and utilities  fuel and utilities is comprised of locomotive fuel
utilities other than telephone and gasoline and other fuels expenses declined
184 million 15 in 2002 the decrease was driven by lower fuel prices and a
record low fuel consumption rate as measured by gallons consumed per thousand
gross ton miles fuel prices averaged 73 cents per gallon in 2002 compared to 88
cents per gallon in 2001 including taxes transportation costs and regional
pricing spreads the railroad hedged approximately 42 of its fuel consumption
for the year which decreased fuel costs by 55 million as of december 31
2002 expected fuel consumption for 2003 is 7 hedged at 58 cents per gallon
excluding taxes transportation costs and regional pricing spreads see note 2
to the consolidated financial statements item 8

materials and supplies  materials used for the maintenance of the railroads
track facilities and equipment is the principal component of materials and
supplies expense office small tools and other supplies and the costs of
freight services purchased to ship company materials are also included expenses
decreased 9 million 2 primarily reflecting a reduction in the number of
locomotives overhauled materials expense for locomotive overhauls decreased due
to the use of new morereliable locomotives during the past several years the
sale of older units which required higher maintenance and increased
outsourcing of locomotive maintenance partially offsetting the reductions in
locomotive overhauls was an increase in cost for freight car repairs

casualty costs  the largest component of casualty costs is personal injury
expense freight and property damage insurance environmental matters and
occupational illness expense are also included in casualty costs costs
increased 32 million 10 compared to 2001 as higher personal injury and
insurance costs were partially offset by lower costs for freight damage

purchased services and other costs  purchased services and other costs include
the costs of services purchased from outside contractors state and local taxes
net costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other railroads
transportation and lodging for train crew employees trucking and contracting
costs for intermodal containers leased automobile maintenance expenses
telephone and cellular expense employee travel expense and computer and other
general expenses expenses increased 93 million 11 compared to 2001
primarily due to increased spending for contract services jointly operated
facilities and state and local taxes

operating income  operating income increased 252 million 12 to a record
23 billion in 2002 the operating margin for 2002 was 210 compared to 193
in 2001

nonoperating items  interest expense decreased 43 million 7 as a result of
lower average debt levels and lower weightedaverage interest rates in 2002
other income increased 147 million 84 due to the sale transactions with the
uta and vta income taxes increased 126 million 21 in 2002 compared to 2001
resulting from higher pretax income levels in 2002 partially offset by a tax
adjustment for prior years income tax examinations

trucking segment

operating revenues  in 2002 trucking revenues rose 189 million 17 to 133
billion excluding motor cargo in 2002 and 2001 revenue increased 57 million
5 due to an increase in volume of 5 yield improvements and higher revenue
for special services partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue as a
result of lower fuel prices in 2002 included in the volume improvement was
additional business realized as a result of the forced closure of consolidated
freightways in september 2002

operating expenses  trucking operating expenses rose 172 million 16 to
126 billion in 2002 excluding motor cargo in 2002 and 2001 expenses
increased 50 million 5 salaries wages and employee benefits increased 117
million 17 excluding motor cargo in 2002 and 2001 expenses increased 48
million 7 due to wage and benefit inflation and increased volume costs
partially offset by productivity improvements and a 2 reduction in the number
of employees productivity is measured as total costs related to local dock
and linehaul operations relative to the total volume shipped equipment and
other rents increased 33 million 35 excluding motor cargo in 2002 and 2001
expenses increased 18 million 20 due primarily to the increased use of
linehaul rail and contract transportation to handle the additional business of
the former consolidated freightways depreciation expense increased 11 million
23 compared to 2001 excluding motor cargo in 2002 and 2001 expense
increased 2 million 5 due to purchases of new equipment fuel and utilities
costs increased 1 million 1 excluding motor cargo in 2002 and 2001
expenses decreased 7 million 11 as a result of lower fuel prices during the
year 74 cents per gallon average in 2002 compared to 82 cents per gallon
average in 2001 including transportation costs but excluding taxes and by a
3 decrease in gallons consumed for the year ended december 31 2002 overnite
hedged approximately 14 of its fuel consumed for 2002 which decreased fuel
prices by 12 million as of december 31 2002 expected fuel consumption for
2003 is 5 hedged at 58 cents per gallon excluding taxes transportation costs
and regional pricing spreads materials and supplies expense increased 4
million 8 compared to 2001 excluding motor cargo in 2002 and 2001 expenses
decreased 2 million 4 due to lower maintenance and operating supplies
expense as a result of cost control measures casualty costs increased 8
million 17 excluding motor cargo in 2002 and 2001 expenses increased 6
million 12 due to higher personal injury and insurance expenses purchased
services and other costs decreased 2 million 2 excluding motor cargo in
2002 and 2001 expenses decreased 15 million 16 due to lower general
supplies expense a favorable legal settlement in the second quarter insourcing
of contract programmers and other cost control measures

operating income  trucking operations generated operating income of 71 million
in 2002 an increase of 17 million over 2001 excluding motor cargo in 2002 and
2001 operating income increased 8 million 14 the operating margin was 53
compared to 47 in 2001 motor cargo improved the operating margin by 02

consolidated

net income  the corporation reported net income of 966 million 390 per
basic share and 377 per diluted share in 2001 compared to 842 million 342
per basic share and 334 per diluted share in 2000 excluding the effect of a
115 million pretax 72 million aftertax charge in 2000 related to a work
force reduction plan at the railroad 2000 net income was 914 million 371
per basic share and 361 per diluted share the increase in net income
excluding the work force reduction charge in 2000 was due primarily to revenue
growth productivity gains and cost control lower nonoperating expense and
lower fuel prices

operating revenues  operating revenues increased 95 million 1 to 120
billion in 2001 reflecting 1 growth at the railroad and 3 growth in the
trucking segment the corporation recognizes transportation revenues on a
percentageofcompletion basis as freight moves from origin to destination
other revenue is recognized as service is performed or contractual obligations
are met

operating expenses  operating expenses decreased 74 million 1 to 99
billion in 2001 from 100 billion in 2000 excluding the effect of the work
force reduction charge in 2000 operating expenses increased 41 million
compared to 2000 reflecting wage and benefit inflation and higher equipment
rents and depreciation expenses these increases were partially offset by a 4
reduction in employment levels at the railroad lower fuel prices and cost
control efforts lower fuel prices in 2001 versus 2000 reduced fuel expense by
35 million in 2001

   salaries wages and employee benefits decreased 35 million compared to 2000
excluding the work force reduction charge salaries wages and employee benefits
increased 80 million 2 as wage and benefit inflation and volume costs
exceeded savings from lower employment levels and improved productivity
equipment and other rents expense increased 26 million 2 as a result of
additional locomotive lease expense and longer car cycle times which indicates
that cars spent more time on the rail system between shipments partially
offsetting these increases were lower costs due to declines in rail traffic
requiring rental of freight cars in addition the railroad experienced lower
rental rates and overnite experienced lower contract transportation costs
depreciation expense increased 34 million 3 as a result of the railroads
capital spending in recent years which increased the total value of the
corporations assets subject to depreciation see note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements item 8 fuel and utilities costs were down 34 million
3 compared to 2000 due to lower fuel prices and a lower fuel consumption
rate partially offset by higher gross ton miles at the railroad and losses on
fuel hedging activity see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements item
8 materials and supplies expense decreased 56 million 9 primarily due to
reduced locomotive repairs and cost control actions casualty costs increased
16 million 4 over 2000 due to higher insurance bad debts and environmental
expenses other costs decreased 25 million 3 as productivity and cost
control efforts more than offset higher state and local taxes

operating income  operating income increased 169 million 9 to 21 billion
in 2001 excluding the effect of the 115 million work force reduction charge in
2000 2001 operating income increased 54 million 3 as revenue growth
productivity gains and lower fuel prices more than offset inflation increased
depreciation expense and higher rail costs due to increased rail volume

nonoperating items  interest expense decreased 22 million 3 compared to
2000 due to lower weightedaverage debt levels and weightedaverage interest
rates in 2001 in 2001 the corporations weightedaverage debt level decreased
from 10044 million in 2000 to 9980 million in 2001 the corporations
weightedaverage interest rate was 70 in 2001 as compared to 72 in 2000
other income increased 32 million 25 in 2001 compared to 2000 due primarily
to higher real estate sales income tax expense increased 99 million 21 in
2001 over 2000 excluding the effect of the 115 million work force reduction
charge on income tax expense in 2000 income taxes for 2001 increased 56
million 11 over 2000 the increase was a result of higher pretax income
levels in 2001 and an increase in the effective tax rate from 357 in 2000 to
370 in 2001

rail segment

net income  rail operations reported net income of 11 billion in 2001
compared to net income of 926 million in 2000 up 14 excluding the work force
reduction charge in 2000 net income was 998 million the increase in earnings
resulted from higher commodity revenue and real estate sales combined with lower
fuel expense interest expense and materials and supplies expense these
improvements were partially offset by inflation lower other revenue and higher
equipment rent and depreciation expenses

operating revenues  rail operating revenues increased 69 million 1 over
2000 to 108 billion revenue carloads were flat with an increase in the energy
and agricultural commodity groups offset by decreases in the other four
commodity groups the decrease in other revenue was the result of lower
switching subsidiary and accessorial revenues

agricultural  revenue increased 4 due primarily to a 3 increase in average
revenue per car carloads were flat as higher corn shipments and meals and oils
exports were offset by a decrease in demand for domestic and export wheat
shipments and a poor sugarbeet harvest revenue gains were also achieved
through increased beer imports from mexico wine shipments from california to
eastern markets express service of fresh and frozen products and increased
demand for cottonseed average revenue per car increased due to a longer average
length of haul resulting from fewer shorthaul wheat and sweetener shipments
combined with increased longhaul domestic and mexico corn shipments

automotive  revenue declined 5 as a result of a 6 decrease in carloads and a
1 increase in average revenue per car materials volumes declined 16 as the
soft economy and a decline in vehicle sales led to high inventories low
industry production and auto plant shutdowns total finished vehicle shipments
declined only 1 as industry weakness was mitigated by market share gains
consumer incentives in the fourth quarter stimulated vehicle sales and helped
offset weakness early in the year average revenue per car increased due to a
shift in mix of materials shipped resulting from fewer shipments of materials
with lower average revenue per car additionally more materials were shipped in
boxcars rather than containers which yield higher average revenue per car than
containers

chemicals  revenue declined 6 due to a 6 decrease in carloads volume
declines were the result of the soft economy as reduced demand for consumer
durables led to high manufacturer inventories and weak demand for plastics
reduced industrial manufacturing also depressed demand for liquid and dry
chemicals fertilizer and phosphate rock revenues decreased as high energy costs
early in the year reduced the market for these commodities average revenue per
car was flat as the positive impact of fewer low average revenue per car
phosphate rock shipments was offset by a decrease in average revenue per car for
soda ash shipments

energy  energy commodity revenue increased 11 compared to 2000 due to a 12
increase in carloads records were set in 2001 for total carloads revenue and
coal trains loaded per day in the southern powder river basin in wyoming and in
the coal mining regions of colorado and utah these increases were driven by
strong utility demand caused by severe winter weather in late 2000 and the first
quarter of 2001 in the first half of the year demand for coal also increased
due to the high cost of alternative fuels such as natural gas fuel oil and
higherpriced easternsourced coal carloads also increased due to gains in
market share

industrial products  revenue decreased 1 as a 2 decline in carloads was
partially offset by a 1 increase in average revenue per car the decline was
mainly the result of the economic slowdown which had a negative effect on many
economically sensitive commodities including steel and paper markets steel
producers were additionally impacted by high levels of lowcost imported steel
which forced plant shutdowns and bankruptcies newsprint and fiber revenue
declined due to lack of demand for printed advertising partially offsetting
these declines were increases in constructionrelated commodities led by stone
and cement as strong building and road construction activity continued in the
south and southwestern regions of the country lumber volumes increased due to
strong housing construction and uncertainty surrounding restrictions on canadian
lumber imports average revenue per car increased due to price increases and a
greater mix of longer average length of haul business these gains were
partially offset by the impact of increased shipments of stone which generates
lower average revenue per car

intermodal  revenue was flat as a 3 decline in carloads was offset by a 3
increase in average revenue per car the volume decrease was primarily the
result of soft economic demand for domestic shipments in addition the
voluntary action of shedding lowmargin trailer business in favor of
highermargin containers contributed to the decline partially offsetting the
domestic declines were increases in international shipments the result of
higher import demand the increase in average revenue per car was primarily the
result of price increases

operating expenses  operating expenses decreased 109 million 1 to 87
billion in 2001 excluding the 115 million work force reduction charge in 2000
operating expenses were essentially flat higher expenses as a result of
inflation higher equipment rents expense and depreciation were offset by
savings from lower force levels productivity gains and cost control efforts and
lower fuel prices

salaries wages and employee benefits  salaries wages and employee benefits
decreased 83 million 2 in 2001 to 35 billion excluding the 115 million
work force reduction charge in 2000 salaries wages and employee benefits
expense increased 32 million 1 the primary driver of the increase was wage
and employee benefits inflation a 3 gross ton mile increase also added volume
costs a 4 reduction in employee force levels as a result of the work force
reduction plan offset a significant portion of these higher costs

equipment and other rents  expenses increased 32 million 3 compared to 2000
due primarily to higher locomotive lease expense and longer car cycle times the
higher locomotive lease expense is due to the railroads increased leasing of
new more reliable and fuel efficient locomotives these new locomotives
replaced older nonleased models in the fleet which helped reduce expenses for
depreciation labor materials and fuel during the year the increase in car
cycle times is partially attributable to a decline in automotive shipments
earlier in the year which resulted in excess freight cars being stored at
assembly plants and unloading facilities partially offsetting the increases in
expenses were lower volume costs lower car leases and lower prices for
equipment the decrease in volume costs was attributable to a decline in
carloads in commodity groups such as industrial products and intermodal that
utilize a high percentage of rented freight cars

depreciation  depreciation expense increased 31 million 3 over 2000
resulting from capital spending in recent years capital spending totaled 17
billion in 2001 and in 2000 and 18 billion in 1999

fuel and utilities  expenses decreased 30 million 2 the decrease was
driven by lower fuel prices and a record low fuel consumption rate as measured
by gallons consumed per thousand gross ton miles fuel prices averaged 88 cents
per gallon in 2001 compared to 90 cents per gallon in 2000 including taxes
transportation costs and regional pricing spreads of 17 cents and 13 cents in
2001 and 2000 respectively the railroad hedged approximately 32 of its fuel
consumption for the year which increased fuel costs by 20 million as of
december 31 2001 expected fuel consumption for 2002 is 44 hedged at 56 cents
per gallon excluding taxes transportation costs and regional pricing spreads
and for 2003 is 5 hedged at 56 cents per gallon excluding taxes transportation
costs and regional pricing spreads see note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements item 8

materials and supplies  expenses decreased 71 million 13 reflecting
locomotive overhaul reductions and productivity improvements and cost control
measures locomotive overhauls decreased due to acquisition of new
morereliable locomotives during the year and the sale of older units which
required higher maintenance materials and supplies expenses related to car
maintenance also declined due to lower business levels in the industrial
products and automotive commodity groups the cars utilized in these commodity
groups normally require more maintenance than the cars utilized within the other
commodity groups

casualty costs  costs increased 9 million 3 compared to 2000 as higher
insurance bad debt and environmental expenses were partially offset by lower
personal injury costs and lower costs for damaged freight cars

other costs  expenses increased 3 million flat compared to 2000 primarily
due to higher state and local taxes

operating income  operating income increased 178 million 9 to 21 billion
excluding the 115 million work force reduction charge in 2000 operating income
increased 63 million 3 in 2001 the operating margin for 2001 was 193
compared to 177 in 2000 excluding the work force reduction charge the
operating margin for 2000 was 188

nonoperating items  nonoperating expense decreased 56 million 12 compared
to 2000 real estate sales and net other income increased 48 million 38
interest expense decreased 8 million 1 as a result of lower weightedaverage
debt levels in 2001 income taxes increased 102 million 20 in 2001 compared
to 2000 excluding the work force reduction charge in 2000 income tax expense
increased 59 million 11 the increase was a result of higher pretax income
levels in 2001 and an increase in the effective tax rate from 356 in 2000 to
367 in 2001

trucking segment

operating revenues  in 2001 trucking revenues rose 30 million 3 to 1143
million the growth resulted from rate increases new services and 10 million
in incremental revenue due to the acquisition of motor cargo tonnage for the
year was flat compared to 2000

operating expenses  trucking operating expenses rose 29 million 3 to 1089
million in 2001 salaries wages and employee benefits increased 40 million
6 due to a 4 increase in employees as well as wage and benefit inflation and
enhancements fuel and utilities costs decreased 5 million 7 as a result of
lower fuel prices during the year 82 cents per gallon average in 2001 compared
to 90 cents per gallon average in 2000 including transportation costs and
regional pricing spreads and excluding taxes partially offset by a 1
increase in gallons consumed overnite did not hedge any fuel volume for the
year ended december 31 2001 however as of december 31 2001 overnite had
hedged approximately 16 of its expected fuel consumption for 2002 at an average
of 58 cents per gallon excluding taxes transportation costs and regional
pricing spreads and had hedged approximately 5 of its expected fuel consumption
for 2003 at an average of 58 cents per gallon excluding taxes transportation
costs and regional pricing spreads equipment and other rents decreased 4
million 4 due to decreased use of contract transportation during the year
high utilization of contract transportation in 2000 was necessary due to the
teamsters related work stoppage casualty costs increased 7 million 18 due
to higher bad debt insurance and cargo loss and damage expenses other costs
decreased 11 million 10 due to lower expenses related to decreased security
related to teamsters matters legal and employee travel expenses in 2001

operating income  trucking operations generated operating income of 54 million
in 2001 compared to 53 million for 2000 the operating ratio increased to
953 compared to 952 in 2000

other product lines

other  operating losses increased 10 million in 2001 compared to 2000
operating revenues declined 4 million year over year operating expenses
increased 6 million due to increased spending at the technology companies to
develop new products and services

liquidity and capital resources

as of december 31 2002 the corporations principal sources of liquidity
included cash cash equivalents the sale of receivables and revolving credit
facilities as well as issuance of commercial paper and other sources of
financing through the capital markets the corporation had 1875 billion of
credit facilities available of which there were no borrowings

outstanding as of december 31 2002 the sale of receivables program is subject
to certain requirements including the maintenance of an investment grade bond
rating if the corporations bond rating were to deteriorate it could have an
adverse impact on the liquidity of the corporation receivables sold as of
december 31 2002 were 600 million access to commercial paper is dependent on
market conditions deterioration of the corporations operating results or
financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact
the corporations ability to utilize commercial paper as a source of liquidity
liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on the financial
stability of the corporation

financial condition

cash from operations was 23 billion 20 billion and 21 billion in 2002
2001 and 2000 respectively the increase from 2001 to 2002 is the result of
higher net income partially offset by pension plan funding the decrease from
2000 to 2001 was primarily due to the timing of large cash payments including
the payments for the work force reduction plan in 2001

   cash used in investing activities was 15 billion in 2002 and in 2001 and
16 billion in 2000 the amount remained essentially flat from 2001 to 2002 as
higher real estate sales a warranty refund from a vendor and a dividend from an
affiliate in 2002 were offset by higher capital spending the decrease from 2000
to 2001 was due to reduced capital spending and higher asset sales in 2001
partially offset by the receipt of cash dividends in 2000

   cash used in financing activities was 473 million 440 million and 486
million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the increase from 2001 to 2002
reflects lower financings 775 million in 2002 versus 925 million in 2001
partly offset by an increase in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options
150 million in 2002 versus 52 million in 2001 the decrease from 2000 to
2001 reflects higher financings in 2001 925 million in 2001 versus 506
million in 2000 and an increase in stock option proceeds 52 million in 2001
versus 3 million in 2000 partially offset by higher debt repayments 12
billion in 2001 versus 796 million in 2000

   including the convertible preferred securities see note 5 to the
consolidated financial statements item 8 as an equity instrument the ratio of
debt to total capital employed was 388 422 and 451 at december 31 2002
2001 and 2000 respectively

   for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 the corporations
ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 39 30 and 25 respectively the ratio
of earnings to fixed charges has been computed on a consolidated basis earnings
represent net income less equity in undistributed earnings of unconsolidated
affiliates plus fixed charges and income taxes fixed charges represent
interest charges amortization of debt discount and the estimated amount
representing the interest portion of rental charges

contractual obligations and commercial commitments

as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements item 8 as
referenced in the tables below the corporation has contractual obligations and
commercial commitments that may affect the financial condition of the
corporation however based on managements assessment of the underlying
provisions and circumstances of the material contractual obligations and
commercial commitments of the corporation including material sources of
offbalance sheet and structured finance arrangements there is no known trend
demand commitment event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur
which would have a material adverse effect on the corporations consolidated
results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition the
commercial obligations financings and commitments made by the corporation are
customary transactions which are similar to those of other comparable industrial
corporations particularly within the transportation industry

financial position as debt see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements
item 8

   in december 2001 the railroad entered into a synthetic operating lease
arrangement to finance a new headquarters building which will be constructed in
omaha nebraska the expected completion date of the building is mid2004 it
will total approximately 11 million square feet with approximately 3800 office
workspaces the cost to construct the new headquarters including capitalized
interest is approximately 260 million the corporation has guaranteed all of
the railroads obligation under this lease

   uprr is the construction agent for the lessor during the construction period
the railroad has guaranteed in the event of a loss caused by or resulting from
its actions or failures to act as construction agent 899 of the building
related construction costs incurred up to that point during the construction
period total building related costs incurred and drawn from the lease funding
commitments as of december 31 2002 were approximately 50 million
accordingly the railroads guarantee at december 31 2002 was approximately
45 million as construction continues and additional costs are incurred this
guarantee will increase accordingly

   after construction is complete uprr will lease the building under an initial
term of five years with provisions for renewal for an extended period subject to
agreement between the railroad and lessor at any time during the lease the
railroad may at its option purchase the building at approximately the amount
expended by the lessor to construct the building if the railroad elects not to
purchase the building or renew the lease the building is returned to the lessor
for remarketing and the railroad has guaranteed a residual value equal to 85
of the total construction related costs the guarantee will be approximately
220 million

other matters

personal injury and occupational illness  the cost of injuries to employees and
others related to railroad activities or in accidents involving the trucking
segment is charged to expense based on actuarial estimates of the ultimate cost
and number of incidents each year during 2002 the railroads reported number
of workrelated injuries that resulted in lost job time decreased 5 compared to
the number of injuries reported during 2001 and accidents at grade crossings
decreased 16 compared to 2001 annual expenses for the corporations personal
injuryrelated events were 259 million in 2002 227 million in 2001 and 226
million in 2000 as of december 31 2002 and 2001 the corporation had a
liability of 724 million and 743 million respectively accrued for future
personal injury costs of which 304 million and 295 million were recorded in
current liabilities as accrued casualty costs the railroad has additional
amounts accrued for claims related to certain occupational illnesses
compensation for railroad workrelated accidents is governed by the federal
employers liability act fela under fela damages are assessed based on a
finding of fault through litigation or outofcourt settlements the railroad
offers a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for
employees who are injured at work

environmental costs  the corporation generates and transports hazardous and
nonhazardous waste in its current and former operations and is subject to
federal state and local environmental laws and regulations the corporation has
identified approximately 433 sites at which it is or may be liable for
remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of
environmental requirements this includes 52 sites that are the subject of
actions taken by the us government 27 of which are currently on the superfund
national priorities list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several
liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently the
corporations ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to
activities of other parties in addition to costs relating to its own activities
at each site

   when an environmental issue has been identified with respect to the property
owned leased or otherwise used in the conduct of the corporations business
the corporation and its consultants perform environmental assessments on such
property the corporation expenses the cost of the assessments as incurred the
corporation accrues the cost of remediation where its obligation is probable and
such costs can be reasonably estimated


                                       28
page


   as of december 31 2002 and 2001 the corporation had a liability of 189
million and 172 million respectively accrued for future environmental costs
of which 72 million and 71 million were recorded in current liabilities as
accrued casualty costs the liability includes future costs for remediation and
restoration of sites as well as for ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any
anticipated recoveries from third parties cost estimates are based on
information available for each site financial viability of other potentially
responsible parties and existing technology laws and regulations the
corporation believes that it has adequately accrued for its ultimate share of
costs at sites subject to joint and several liability however the ultimate
liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of
potentially responsible parties involved sitespecific cost sharing
arrangements with other potentially responsible parties the degree of
contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data
related to many of the sites andor the speculative nature of remediation
costs the corporation expects to pay out the majority of the december 31 2002
environmental liability over the next five years funded by cash generated from
operations

   remediation of identified sites previously used in operations used by
tenants or contaminated by former owners required cash spending of 68 million
in 2002 63 million in 2001 and 62 million in 2000 the corporation is also
engaged in reducing emissions spills and migration of hazardous materials and
spent cash of 6 million 5 million and 8 million in 2002 2001 and 2000
respectively for control and prevention in 2003 the corporation anticipates
spending 65 million for remediation and 9 million for control and prevention
the impact of current obligations is not expected to have a material adverse
effect on the liquidity of the corporation

labor matters

rail  approximately 87 of the railroads nearly 47000 employees are
represented by 14 major rail unions national negotiations under the railway
labor act to revise the national labor agreements for all crafts began in late
1999 in may 2001 the brotherhood of maintenance of way employees bmwe
ratified a fiveyear agreement which included provisions for an annual wage
increase based on the consumer price index and progressive health and welfare
cost sharing in august 2002 the carriers reached a five year agreement with
the united transportation union utu for annual wage increases as follows 40
july 2002 25 july 2003 and 30 july 2004 the agreement also established a
process for resolving the health and welfare cost sharing issue through
arbitration and also provided for the operation of remote control locomotives by
trainmen the brotherhood of locomotive engineers ble challenged the remote
control feature of the utu agreement and a recent arbitration decision held that
operation of remote control by utu members in terminals does not violate the ble
agreement in november 2002 the international brotherhood of boilermakers and
blacksmiths ibb reached a five year agreement following the utu wage pattern
in january 2003 an arbitration award was rendered establishing wage increases
and health and welfare employee cost sharing for the transportation
communications international union tcu contract discussions with the
remaining unions are either in negotiation or mediation also during 2002 the
national mediation board ruled against the utu on its petition for a single
operating craft on the kansas city southern railroad the ble is now working on
a possible merger with the international brotherhood of teamsters teamsters

trucking  during 2002 otc continued to oppose the efforts of the teamsters to
unionize otc service centers on february 11 2002 the united states court of
appeals for the fourth circuit sitting as a full panel refused to enforce four
bargaining orders issued by the national labor relations board nlrb that would
have required otc to bargain with the teamsters even though the teamsters lost
secret ballot elections subsequently the nlrb moved for a judgment against
itself to reverse the seven other bargaining orders it had issued and the
fourth circuit entered that judgment on october 11 2002 the nlrbs general
counsel dismissed a charge the teamsters had filed in august 2001 alleging that
otc had been bargaining in bad faith otc has not reached any collective
bargaining agreement with the teamsters on october 24 2002 the teamsters
ended the national strike they had called against otc three years earlier

   the teamsters eightyear campaign to organize otcs service centers has
become almost entirely dormant and since october 2002 the teamsters have lost
rights to represent 41 of the approximately 2100 employees they had organized
the teamsters had become the bargaining representative of the employees at 26 of
otcs 170 service centers but the employees at 17 of these locations recently
have voted to decertify the teamsters and the nlrb has officially approved the
votes in 14 of those locations decertification petitions are pending at four
other service centers only a single representation petition currently is
pending but due to strike violence charges pending against the teamsters the
nlrb has blocked the teamsters efforts to precipitate an election in all the
teamsters currently represent approximately 10 of otcs 12534 employees

   employees at two motor cargo service centers located in north salt lake utah
and reno nevada representing approximately 11 of motor cargos total work
force at 33 service centers are covered by two separate collective bargaining


                                       29

agreements with unions affiliated with the teamsters although the agreements
cover most of the employees at these two facilities less than half of these
covered employees are actual members of unions

inflation  the cumulative effect of long periods of inflation has significantly
increased asset replacement costs for capitalintensive companies such as the
railroad otc and motor cargo as a result depreciation charges on an
inflationadjusted basis assuming that all operating assets are replaced at
current price levels would be substantially greater than historically reported
amounts

derivative financial instruments  the corporation and its subsidiaries use
derivative financial instruments in limited instances for other than trading
purposes to manage risk related to changes in fuel prices and to achieve the
corporations interest rate objectives the corporation uses swaps futures
andor forward contracts to mitigate the downside risk of adverse price
movements and hedge the exposure to variable cash flows the use of these
instruments also limits future gains from favorable movements the corporation
uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate changes the
purpose of these programs is to protect the corporations operating margins and
overall profitability from adverse fuel price changes or interest rate
fluctuations

   the corporation may also use swaptions to secure nearterm swap prices
swaptions are swaps that are extendable past their base period at the option of
the counterparty swaptions do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and
are markedtomarket through the consolidated statements of income

market and credit risk  the corporation addresses market risk related to
derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value
fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying item being hedged credit
risk related to derivative financial instruments which is minimal is managed
by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements
at december 31 2002 the corporation has not been required to provide
collateral nor has upc received collateral relating to its hedging activities

   in addition the corporation enters into secured financings in which the
debtor has pledged collateral the collateral is based upon the nature of the
financing and the credit risk of the debtor the corporation generally is not
permitted to sell or repledge the collateral unless the debtor defaults

determination of fair value  the fair values of the corporations derivative
financial instrument positions at december 31 2002 and 2001 were determined
based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or developed
based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the
applicable us treasury rate london interbank offered rates libor or swap
spread

sensitivity analyses  the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the
economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates or fuel prices could
have on the corporations financial instruments these hypothetical changes do
not consider other factors that could impact actual results

interest rates  the corporation manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt
instruments within its debt portfolio over a given period the mix of fixed and
floating rate debt is largely managed through the issuance of targeted amounts
of each as debt matures or as incremental borrowings are required derivatives
are used as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix in addition the
corporation also obtains flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest
rate mix within its debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing
outstanding callable fixedrate debt securities

   at december 31 2002 and 2001 the corporation had variablerate debt
representing approximately 12 of its total debt if variable interest rates
average 10 higher in 2003 than the corporations december 31 2002 variable
rate which was approximately 3 the corporations interest expense would
increase by less than 5 million after tax if variable interest rates had
averaged 10 higher in 2002 than the corporations december 31 2001 variable
rate the corporations interest expense would have increased by less than 5
million after tax these amounts were determined by considering the impact of
the hypothetical interest rates on the balances of the corporations
variablerate debt at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively

   swaps allow the corporation to convert debt from fixed rates to variable
rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debts fair value
attributable to the changes in the benchmark interest rate libor the swaps
have been accounted for using the shortcut method as allowed by financial
accounting standard fas 133 therefore no ineffectiveness has been

recorded within the corporations consolidated financial statements in january
2002 the corporation entered into an interest rate swap on 250 million of debt
with a maturity date of december 2006 in may 2002 the corporation entered into
an interest rate swap on 150 million of debt with a maturity date of february
2023 this swap contained a call option that matches the call option of the
underlying hedged debt as allowed by fas 133 in january 2003 the swaps
counterparty exercised their option to cancel the swap effective february 1
2003 similarly the corporation has exercised its option to redeem the
underlying debt as of december 31 2002 and 2001 the corporation had
approximately 898 million and 598 million of interest rate swaps
respectively the effect of a 10 interest rate increase or decrease in 2003
over the december 31 2002 rates is included in the preceding and succeeding
paragraph disclosure respectively

   market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in
fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates as of
december 31 2002 and amounts to approximately 203 million at december 31
2002 market risk resulting from a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates
as of december 31 2001 amounted to approximately 226 million at december 31
2001 the fair values of the corporations fixedrate debt were estimated by
considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market
prices and current borrowing rates

fuel  fuel costs are a significant portion of the corporations total operating
expenses as a result of the significance of fuel costs and the historical
volatility of fuel prices the corporations transportation subsidiaries
periodically use swaps futures andor forward contracts to mitigate the impact
of adverse fuel price changes the corporation at times may use swaptions to
secure more favorable swap prices

   as of december 31 2002 expected rail fuel consumption for 2003 is 7 hedged
at 58 cents per gallon excluding taxes transportation costs and regional
pricing spreads as of december 31 2002 the railroad has no outstanding hedges
for 2004 based on annualized fuel consumption during 2002 and excluding the
impact of the hedging program each onecent increase in the price of fuel would
have resulted in approximately 82 million of additional fuel expense after
tax

   as of december 31 2001 the corporation had hedged approximately 44 of its
forecasted 2002 fuel consumption and 5 of its forecasted 2003 fuel consumption
at 56 cents per gallon excluding taxes transportation costs and regional
pricing spreads

   as of december 31 2002 expected trucking fuel consumption for 2003 is 5
hedged at 58 cents per gallon excluding taxes transportation costs and
regional pricing spreads as of december 31 2002 there are no outstanding
hedges for 2004 based on annualized fuel consumption during 2002 and excluding
the impact of the hedging program each onecent increase in the price of fuel
would have resulted in approximately 400000 of additional fuel expense after
tax

   as of december 31 2001 the corporation had hedged approximately 16 of its
forecasted 2002 trucking fuel consumption and 5 of its forecasted 2003 fuel
consumption at 58 cents per gallon excluding taxes transportation costs and
regional pricing spreads

pensions  during the second quarter of 2002 the corporation decreased its
assumed rate of return on pension plan assets from 10 to 9 this assumption
change resulted in an increase to 2002 pension expense of 22 million in
addition due to declines on plan assets a minimum pension liability adjustment
was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2002 this adjustment resulted in a
reduction of common shareholders equity the reduction in equity totaled 225
million after tax approximately 2 of total equity

railroad voluntarily contributed 100 million to its pension plan during the
fourth quarter of 2002 the corporation currently does not have any minimum
funding requirements as set forth in employee benefit and tax laws however
upc plans to voluntarily contribute approximately 75 million during 2003
required contributions subsequent to 2003 are dependent on asset returns
current discount rates and a number of other factors however the corporation
expects to continue discretionary funding to help manage any potential required
funding in the future future contributions are expected to be funded primarily
by cash generated from operating activities

2003 business outlook

rail  the railroad expects to build on the positive momentum generated in the
past several years and continue to grow revenue operating income and free cash
flow free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less
cash used in investing activities and dividends paid yearoveryear revenue
growth is projected in all commodity groups with the largest percentage
increases projected in the intermodal agricultural and industrial groups
revenue derived from chemical and energy shipments is expected to increase
steadily over 2003 automotive revenue is also expected to increase slightly
from last years record setting pace thereby continuing as a strong revenue
provider the railroad will continue to focus on improving service performance
while developing new innovative rail service offerings to meet the changing
needs of its customers while operating expenses will likely increase for such
items as insurance pension operating taxes and minimum guaranteed payments to
union employees cost controls and continuing improvements in productivity will
remain a focus to drive the operating ratio lower fuel price will remain
susceptible to near term volatile price swings to help reduce the impact of
fuel price volatility on earnings the railroad will continue to look for
opportunities to use hedge contracts

trucking  overnite expects financial performance to further improve upon its
positive 2002 results solid revenue growth is projected in part due to
additional business resulting from the forced closure of consolidated
freightways cost controls and productivity improvements are projected to
positively impact operating expenses which will mitigate the impact of
inflationary pressures and volatile fuel prices overnite will continue to offer
reliable ontime performance and quality service which should enable overnite
to maintain profitable margins

expected to be funded through cash generated from operations additional debt
financings and the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating
properties the corporation expects that these sources will continue to provide
sufficient funds to meet cash requirements in the foreseeable future in 2003

expenditures these capital expenditures will be used to maintain track and
structures continue capacity expansions on the railroads main lines upgrade
and augment equipment to better meet customer needs build infrastructure and

disposed of or as a generator or a transporter of hazardous substances disposed

further assessment

item 3 legal proceedings

southern pacific acquisition

on august 12 1996 the stb served a decision the decision approving the
acquisition of control of southern pacific by upc subject to various
conditions the acquisition was consummated on september 11 1996 various
appeals were filed with respect to the decision and all such appeals were
ultimately consolidated in the us court of appeals for the district of
columbia circuit and all of the appeals have since been withdrawn or denied

    among the conditions to the stbs approval of the southern pacific
acquisition was the requirement that the stb retain oversight jurisdiction for
five years to examine whether the conditions imposed under the decision remain
effective to address the competitive harms caused by the merger on july 2
2001 the railroad filed its fifth comprehensive summary with the stb
interested parties were required to file comments concerning the fifth annual
oversight proceeding by august 21 2001 and replies were due on september 4
2001 on december 20 2001 the stb issued a decision concluding the fifth and
final oversight proceeding and announcing the end to the formal oversight
process the stb will continue to have authority to enforce the conditions it
imposed on the merger to ensure they are implemented in a manner that
effectively preserves premerger competition

shareholder litigation

a purported derivative action was filed by nine individuals seven of whom are
members of the teamsters on behalf of the corporation on june 21 2001 in the
chancery court of shelby county tennessee naming as defendants current and
certain former directors of the corporation and various present and former
officers and employees of overnite as well as overnite and as a nominal
defendant the corporation the derivative action alleges among other things
that the named defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the corporation
wasted its assets and mismanaged the company by opposing the efforts of the
teamsters to organize the employees of overnite plaintiffs claim that the
antiunion campaign allegedly waged by the defendants cost millions of dollars
and caused a substantial decline in the value of overnite on july 31 2001
defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action on various grounds the
corporation overnite and the individual defendants believe that the claims
raised by the plaintiffs are without merit and intend to defend them vigorously

labor matters

the general counsel of the national labor relations board nlrb is seeking a
bargaining order remedy in 11 cases involving overnite where a teamsters local
union lost a representation election a bargaining order remedy would require
overnite to recognize and bargain with the union as if the union had won instead
of lost the election and would be warranted only if the following findings are
made 1 the petitioning teamsters local had obtained valid authorization
cards from a majority of the employees in an appropriate unit 2 overnite
committed serious unfair labor practices and 3 those unfair labor practices
would preclude the holding of a fair election despite the application of less
drastic remedies in these 11 cases an administrative law judge and the nlrb
ruled that the bargaining order remedy is warranted overnite appealed the
nlrbs ruling to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit by a
twoone decision the fourth circuit initially enforced the first four
bargaining orders last year the full fourth circuit agreed to rehear that
case on february 11 2002 the full fourth circuit ruled in overnites favor on
the bargaining order remedy in the first four cases and remanded the cases to
the nlrb for new representation elections the time for seeking review in the
united states supreme court has not yet expired appeal of the seven cases had
been held in abeyance pending this decision and now will be heard by the fourth
circuit if the nlrb does not withdraw the bargaining orders on its own overnite
believes that supreme court review of the first four cases in unlikely and that
there is no substantial basis to distinguish the seven remaining cases from the
four recently decided by the fourth circuit in a twelfth case the
administrative law judge found that a bargaining order remedy was not warranted

environmental matters

on january 30 2002 the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq
issued to the railroad a notice of a proposed penalty assessment in the amount
of 195700 in connection with the release of water potentially impacted by the
derailment of a train near eunice louisiana on may 27 2000 the railroad
previously met with the ldeq regarding this matter to present documentation
indicating that no penalty should be assessed and intends to vigorously defend
this matter

    the state of illinois filed a complaint against the railroad with the
illinois pollution board on may 14 2001 seeking penalties for an alleged
violation of state air pollution laws arising out of a release of styrene from a
tank car near cora illinois which occurred on august 29 1997 the car
contained styrene monomer a hazardous substance stabilized by an inhibitor by
the origin shipper the car was delayed in transit for a number of different
reasons including rerouting and reconsignment by the shipper the railroad was
not notified that such delays could jeopardize the shipment eventually the
effect of the inhibitor wore off and the styrene went into a reactive state
resulting in pressure and venting near cora illinois a sparselypopulated area
was evacuated for a few hours the situation was controlled and remediated
promptly styrene has since been put on the railroads list of time sensitive
shipments for special monitoring the state of illinois seeks to assess a
penalty in excess of 100000 the railroad believes the penalty should be
significantly less than 100000 and is vigorously defending the case a hearing
of the complaint is scheduled for march 22 2002

     the corporation and its affiliates have received notices from the epa and
state environmental agencies alleging that they are or may be liable under
certain federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various
sites throughout the united states including sites which are on the superfund
national priorities list or state superfund lists although specific claims have
been made by the epa and state regulators with respect to some of these sites
the ultimate impact of these proceedings and suits by third parties cannot be
predicted at this time because of the number of potentially responsible parties
involved the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and
quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites andor the speculative
nature of remediation costs nevertheless at many of the superfund sites the
corporation believes it will have little or no exposure because no liability
should be imposed under applicable law one or more other financially able
parties generated all or most of the contamination or a settlement of the
corporations exposure has been reached although regulatory proceedings at the
sites involved have not been formally terminated

     information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated
remediation costs is set forth in managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations  other matters  environmental
costs item 7 and in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements item 8

other matters

as previously reported in the corporations annual report on form 10k for 2000
western resources western filed a complaint on january 24 2000 in the us
district court for the district of kansas alleging that uprr and bnsf materially
breached their service obligations under the transportation contract to deliver
coal in a timely manner to westerns jeffrey energy center the original
complaint sought recovery of consequential damages and termination of the
contract excusing western from further performance in an amended complaint
filed september 1 2000 western claimed the right to retroactive termination
and added a claim for restitution on october 23 2001 western moved for leave
to file a second amendment to its complaint to add counts for innocent
misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation and to request rescission of
the contract the railroads are vigorously defending this lawsuit and oppose
amendment of the complaint the suit currently is scheduled for trial in may
2002 if however western is permitted to file the second amended complaint
the trial date likely will be postponed uprr and bnsf have filed two motions
seeking dismissal of the termination and restitution claims both of which are
still pending the railroads believe they have substantial defenses in the case
and intend to continue to defend it aggressively

of operations

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and applicable notes to the consolidated financial
statements item 8 and other information included in this form 10k

    as stated in item 1 union pacific corporation consists of two reportable
segments rail and trucking as well as upcs other product lines other the
rail segment includes the operations of uprr and uprrs subsidiaries and rail
affiliates collectively the railroad the trucking segment includes the
operations of overnite and subsequent to november 30 2001 motor cargo the
corporations other product lines are comprised of the corporate holding company
which largely supports the railroad fenix llc and affiliated technology
companies fenix selfinsurance activities and all appropriate consolidating
entries see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements item 8

2001 compared to 2000 results of operations

consolidated

net income  the corporation reported record net income of 966 million 390
per basic share and 377 per diluted share in 2001 compared to 842 million
342 per basic share and 334 per diluted share in 2000 excluding the
effect of a 115 million pretax 72 million aftertax charge in 2000 related
to a work force reduction plan at the railroad 2000 net income was 914 million
371 per basic share and 361 per diluted share the increase in net income
excluding the work force reduction charge in 2000 was due primarily to revenue
growth productivity gains and cost control lower nonoperating expense and
lower fuel prices

operating revenues  operating revenues increased 95 million 1 to a record
120 billion in 2001 reflecting 1 growth at the railroad and 3 growth in the
trucking segment the corporation recognizes transportation revenues on a
percentageofcompletion basis as freight moves from origin to destination
other revenue is recognized as service is performed or contractual obligations
are met

operating expenses  operating expenses decreased 74 million 1 to 99
billion in 2001 from 100 billion in 2000 excluding the effect of the work
force reduction charge in 2000 operating expenses increased 41 million
compared to 2000 reflecting wage and benefit inflation and higher equipment
rents and depreciation expenses these increases were partially offset by a 4
reduction in employment levels at the railroad lower fuel prices and cost
control efforts lower fuel prices in 2001 versus 2000 reduced fuel expense by
35 million in 2001

     salaries wages and employee benefits decreased 35 million compared to
2000 excluding the work force reduction charge salaries wages and employee
benefits increased 80 million 2 as wage and benefit inflation and volume
costs exceeded savings from lower employment levels and improved productivity
equipment and other rents expense increased 26 million 2 as a result of
additional locomotive lease expense and longer car cycle times which indicates
that cars spent more time on the rail system between shipments partially
offsetting these increases were lower costs due to declines in rail traffic
requiring rental of freight cars in addition the railroad experienced lower
rental rates and overnite experienced lower contract transportation costs
depreciation expense increased 34 million 3 as a result of the railroads
capital spending in recent years which increased the total value of the
corporations assets subject to depreciation see note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements item 8 fuel and utilities costs were down 34 million
3 compared to 2000 due to lower fuel prices and a lower fuel consumption
rate partially offset by higher gross ton miles at the railroad and losses on
fuel hedging activity see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements item
8 materials and supplies expense decreased 56 million 9 primarily due to
reduced locomotive repairs and cost control actions casualty costs increased
16 million 4 over 2000 due to higher insurance bad debts and environmental
expenses other costs decreased 25 million 3 as productivity and cost
control efforts more than offset higher state and local taxes

operating income  operating income increased 169 million 9 to 21 billion
in 2001 excluding the effect of the 115 million work force reduction charge in
2000 2001 operating income increased 54 million 3 as revenue growth
productivity gains and lower fuel prices more than offset inflation increased
depreciation expense and higher rail costs due to increased rail volume

nonoperating items  interest expense decreased 22 million 3 compared to
2000 due to lower weightedaverage debt levels and weightedaverage interest
rates in 2001 in 2001 the corporations weightedaverage debt level decreased
from 10044 million in 2000 to 9980 million in 2001 the corporations
weightedaverage interest rate was 70 in 2001 as compared to 72 in 2000
other income increased 32 million 25 in 2001 compared to 2000 due primarily
to higher real estate sales income tax expense increased 99 million 21 in
2001 over 2000 excluding the effect of the 115 million work force reduction
charge on income tax expense in 2000 income taxes for 2001 increased 56
million 11 over 2000 the increase was a result of higher pretax income
levels in 2001 and an increase in the effective tax rate from 357 in 2000 to
370 in 2001

key measures  net income as a percentage of operating revenues increased to
81 in 2001 from 71 in 2000 net income as a percentage of operating revenues
in 2000 excluding the work force reduction charge was 77 return on average
common shareholders equity was 106 in 2001 up from 101 in 2000 excluding
the charge in 2000 return on average common shareholders equity was 109 in
2000 the corporations operating ratio was 827 in 2001 compared to 840 in
2000 and 830 in 2000 excluding the work force reduction charge

rail segment

net income  rail operations reported record net income of 11 billion in 2001
compared to net income of 926 million in 2000 up 14 excluding the work force
reduction charge in 2000 net income was 998 million the increase in earnings
resulted from higher commodity revenue and real estate sales combined with lower
fuel expense interest expense and materials and supplies expense these
improvements were partially offset by inflation lower other revenue and higher
equipment rent and depreciation expenses

operating revenues  rail operating revenues increased 69 million 1 over
2000 to a record 108 billion revenue carloads were flat with an increase in
the energy and agricultural commodity groups offset by decreases in the other
four commodity groups the decrease in other revenue was the result of lower
switching subsidiary and accessorial revenues

agricultural  revenue increased 4 due primarily to a 3 increase in average
revenue per car carloads were flat as higher corn shipments and meals and oils
exports were offset by a decrease in demand for domestic and export wheat
shipments and a poor sugarbeet harvest revenue gains were also achieved
through increased beer imports from mexico wine shipments from california to
eastern markets express service of fresh and frozen products and increased
demand for cottonseed average revenue per car increased due to a longer average
length of haul resulting from fewer shorthaul wheat and sweetener shipments
combined with increased longhaul domestic and mexico corn shipments

automotive  revenue declined 5 as a result of a 6 decrease in carloads and a
1 increase in average revenue per car materials volumes declined 16 as the
soft economy and a decline in vehicle sales led to high inventories low
industry production and auto plant shutdowns total finished vehicle shipments
declined only 1 as industry weakness was mitigated by market share gains
consumer incentives in the fourth quarter stimulated vehicle sales and helped
offset weakness early in the year average revenue per car increased due to a
shift in mix of materials shipped resulting from fewer shipments of materials
with lower average revenue per car additionally more materials were shipped in
boxcars rather than containers which yield higher average revenue per car than
containers

chemicals  revenue declined 6 due to a 6 decrease in carloads volume
declines were the result of the soft economy as reduced demand for consumer
durables led to high manufacturer inventories and weak demand for plastics
reduced industrial manufacturing also depressed demand for liquid and dry
chemicals fertilizer and phosphate rock revenues decreased as high energy costs
early in the year reduced the market for these commodities average revenue per
car was flat as the positive impact of fewer low average revenue per car
phosphate rock shipments was offset by a decrease in average revenue per car for
soda ash shipments

energy  energy commodity revenue increased 11 compared to 2000 due to a 12
increase in carloads records were set in 2001 for total carloads revenue and
coal trains loaded per day in the southern powder river basin in wyoming



                                       15

and in the coal mining regions of colorado and utah these increases were driven
by strong utility demand caused by severe winter weather in late 2000 and the
first quarter of 2001 in the first half of the year demand for coal also
increased due to the high cost of alternative fuels such as natural gas fuel
oil and higherpriced easternsourced coal carloads also increased due to gains
in market share

industrial products  revenue decreased 1 as a 2 decline in carloads was
partially offset by a 1 increase in average revenue per car the decline was
mainly the result of the economic slowdown which had a negative effect on many
economically sensitive commodities including steel and paper markets steel
producers were additionally impacted by high levels of lowcost imported steel
which forced plant shutdowns and bankruptcies newsprint and fiber revenue
declined due to lack of demand for printed advertising partially offsetting
these declines were increases in constructionrelated commodities led by stone
and cement as strong building and road construction activity continued in the
south and southwestern regions of the country lumber volumes increased due to
strong housing construction and uncertainty surrounding restrictions on canadian
lumber imports average revenue per car increased due to price increases and a
greater mix of longer average length of haul business these gains were
partially offset by the impact of increased shipments of stone which generates
lower average revenue per car

intermodal  revenue was flat as a 3 decline in carloads was offset by a 3
increase in average revenue per car the volume decrease was primarily the
result of soft economic demand for domestic shipments in addition the
voluntary action of shedding lowmargin trailer business in favor of
highermargin containers contributed to the decline partially offsetting the
domestic declines were increases in international shipments the result of
higher import demand the increase in average revenue per car was primarily the
result of price increases

operating expenses  operating expenses decreased 109 million 1 to 87
billion in 2001 excluding the 115 million work force reduction charge in 2000
operating expenses were essentially flat higher expenses as a result of
inflation higher equipment rents expense and depreciation were offset by
savings from lower force levels productivity gains and cost control efforts and
lower fuel prices

salaries wages and employee benefits  salaries wages and employee benefits
decreased 83 million 2 in 2001 to 35 billion excluding the 115 million
work force reduction charge in 2000 salaries wages and employee benefits
expense increased 32 million 1 the primary driver of the increase was wage
and employee benefits inflation a 3 gross ton mile increase also added volume
costs a 4 reduction in employee force levels as a result of the work force
reduction plan offset a significant portion of these higher costs

equipment and other rents  expenses increased 32 million 3 compared to 2000
due primarily to higher locomotive leases and longer car cycle times the higher
locomotive lease expense is due to the railroads increased leasing of new more
reliable and fuel efficient locomotives these new locomotives replaced older
nonleased models in the fleet which helped reduce expenses for depreciation
labor materials and fuel during the year the increase in car cycle times is
partially attributable to a decline in automotive shipments earlier in the year
which resulted in excess freight cars being stored at assembly plants and
unloading facilities partially offsetting the increases in expenses were lower
volume costs lower car leases and lower prices for equipment the decrease in
volume costs was attributable to a decline in carloads in business segments such
as industrial products and intermodal that utilize a high percentage of rented
freight cars

depreciation  depreciation expense increased 31 million 3 over 2000
resulting from capital spending in recent years capital spending totaled 17
billion in 2001 and in 2000 and 18 billion in 1999

fuel and utilities  expenses decreased 30 million 2 the decrease was
driven by lower fuel prices and a record low fuel consumption rate as measured
by gallons consumed per thousand gross ton miles fuel prices averaged 88 cents
per gallon in 2001 compared to 90 cents per gallon in 2000 including taxes
transportation costs and regional pricing spreads of 17 cents and 13 cents in
2001 and 2000 respectively the railroad hedged approximately 32 of its fuel
consumption for the year which increased fuel costs by 20 million as of
december 31 2001 expected fuel consumption for 2002 is 44 hedged at 56 cents
per gallon excluding taxes transportation costs and regional pricing spreads
and for 2003 is 5 hedged at 56 cents per gallon excluding taxes transportation
costs and regional pricing spreads see note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements item 8



                                       16

materials and supplies  expenses decreased 71 million 13 reflecting
locomotive overhaul reductions and productivity improvements and cost control
measures locomotive overhauls decreased due to acquisition of new
morereliable locomotives during the year and the sale of older units which
required higher maintenance materials and supplies expenses related to car
maintenance also declined due to lower business levels in the industrial
products and automotive commodity groups the cars utilized in these commodity
groups normally require more maintenance than the cars utilized within the other
commodity groups

casualty costs  costs increased 9 million 3 compared to 2000 as higher
insurance bad debt and environmental expenses were partially offset by lower
personal injury costs and lower costs for damaged freight cars

other costs  expenses increased 3 million flat compared to 2000 primarily
due to higher state and local taxes

operating income  operating income increased 178 million 9 to 21 billion
excluding the 115 million work force reduction charge in 2000 operating income
increased 63 million 3 in 2001 the operating ratio for 2001 was 807
compared to 823 in 2000 excluding the work force reduction charge the
operating ratio for 2000 was 812

nonoperating items  nonoperating expense decreased 56 million 12 compared
to 2000 real estate sales and net other income increased 48 million 38
interest expense decreased 8 million 1 as a result of lower weightedaverage
debt levels and weightedaverage interest rates in 2001 income taxes increased
102 million 20 in 2001 compared to 2000 excluding the work force reduction
charge in 2000 income tax expense increased 59 million 11 the increase was
a result of higher pretax income levels in 2001 and an increase in the
effective tax rate from 356 in 2000 to 367 in 2001

trucking segment

operating revenues  in 2001 trucking revenues rose 30 million 3 to 1143
million the growth resulted from rate increases new services and 10 million
in incremental revenue due to the acquisition of motor cargo tonnage for the
year was flat compared to 2000

operating expenses  trucking operating expenses rose 29 million 3 to 1089
million in 2001 salaries wages and employee benefits increased 40 million
6 due to a 4 increase in employees as well as wage and benefit inflation and
enhancements fuel and utilities costs decreased 5 million 7 as a result of
lower fuel prices during the year 82 cents per gallon average in 2001 compared
to 90 cents per gallon average in 2000 including transportation costs and
regional pricing spreads and excluding taxes partially offset by a 1
increase in gallons consumed overnite did not hedge any fuel volume for the
year ended december 31 2001 however as of december 31 2001 overnite had
hedged approximately 16 of its expected fuel consumption for 2002 at an average
of 58 cents per gallon excluding taxes transportation costs and regional
pricing spreads and had hedged approximately 5 of its expected fuel consumption
for 2003 at an average of 58 cents per gallon excluding taxes transportation
costs and regional pricing spreads equipment and other rents decreased 4
million 4 due to decreased use of contract transportation during the year
high utilization of contract transportation in 2000 was necessary due to
teamsters related work stoppage casualty costs increased 7 million 18 due
to higher bad debt insurance and cargo loss and damage expenses other costs
decreased 11 million 10 due to lower expenses related to decreased security
related to teamsters matters legal and employee travel expenses in 2001

operating income  trucking operations generated operating income of 54 million
in 2001 compared to 53 million for 2000 the operating ratio increased to
953 compared to 952 in 2000

other product lines

other  operating losses increased 10 million in 2001 compared to 2000
operating revenues declined 4 million year over year operating expenses
increased 6 million due to increased spending at fenix to develop new products
and services

reduction plan at the railroad net income grew to 914 million 371 per basic
share and 361 per diluted share in 2000 compared to 810 million 328 per
basic share and 322 per diluted share in 1999 the increase in net income was
due primarily to revenue growth improved service levels and productivity
improvements at the railroad partially offset by significantly higher fuel
prices net income for 1999 included a onetime aftertax gain of 27 million
011 per basic share and 010 per diluted share from the adjustment of a
liability established in connection with the discontinued operations of a former
subsidiary see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements item 8

operating revenues  operating revenues increased 641 million 6 to 119
billion in 2000 reflecting higher volumes in five of the six commodity groups
at the railroad higher other revenue at the railroad and a 5 increase in
revenue at overnite

operating expenses  operating expenses increased to 100 billion 6 in 2000
from 94 billion in 1999 reflecting the work force reduction charge higher
fuel prices inflation volumerelated costs from a 4 increase in carloads at
the railroad and increased depreciation expense the increase in fuel prices
added 464 million to operating expenses in 2000 compared to 1999 productivity
improvements and other cost control measures partially offset the increase in
operating expenses excluding the 115 million pretax work force reduction
charge operating expenses increased 427 million 5 to 99 billion

     salaries wages and employee benefits increased 26 million 1 compared
to 1999 salaries wages and employee benefits declined 89 million 2
excluding the work force reduction charge as lower employment levels and
improved productivity at the railroad more than offset higher rail volume and
inflation equipment and other rents expense decreased 16 million 1 as
improved car cycle times and lower rental rates more than offset increased
railroad volume and higher contract transportation costs at overnite
depreciation expense increased 57 million 5 as a result of the railroads
capital spending in recent years fuel and utilities costs were 518 million
62 higher than 1999 resulting from significantly higher fuel prices and
increased carloads partially offset by favorable fuel hedging see note 4 to
the consolidated financial statements item 8 materials and supplies expense
increased 3 million 1 primarily due to volumerelated increases in car and
locomotive repairs partially offset by productivity and cost control actions
casualty costs decreased 18 million 5 over 1999 as a result of lower
settlement costs at the railroad other costs decreased 28 million 3 as
productivity and cost control efforts more than offset volumerelated costs and
higher state and local taxes

operating income  operating income increased to 19 billion in 2000 from 18
billion in 1999 as revenue growth and productivity gains at the railroad more
than offset higher fuel prices rail volume costs and increased depreciation
expense excluding the 115 million pretax work force reduction charge
operating income increased 214 million 12 to 20 billion

nonoperating items  interest expense decreased 10 million 1 compared to
1999 primarily due to lower average debt levels in 2000 excluding the income
tax expense associated with the work force reduction charge income taxes for
2000 increased 92 million 22 over 1999 as a result of higher income levels
in 2000 and settlements in 1999 related to prior tax years

key measures  net income as a percentage of operating revenues declined to 71
in 2000 from 72 in 1999 net income as a percentage of operating revenues
excluding the work force reduction charge improved to 77 in 2000 in 2000
return on average common shareholders equity was 101 excluding the work
force reduction charge in 2000 return on average common shareholders equity
was 109 up from 105 in 1999 reflecting strong revenue growth and improved
operations at the railroad and overnite the corporations operating ratio was
840 in 2000 excluding the work force reduction charge in 2000 it was 830
compared to 839 in 1999

primarily from higher commodity and other revenue improved operations
productivity gains and lower interest expense partially offset by significantly
higher fuel prices and volumerelated costs excluding the work force reduction
charge net income was 998 million in 2000

operating revenues  rail operating revenues increased 591 million 6 over
1999 to a record 107 billion revenue carloads increased 4 over 1999 with
gains in five of the six commodity groups other revenue gains were the result
of higher subsidiary revenues and increased accessorial services

agricultural  revenue declined 1 as a 4 decrease in carloads more than
offset a 3 increase in average revenue per car carloads decreased primarily
due to reduced export demand for wheat and corn and a lack of producer selling
in anticipation of higher prices revenue increased for fresh fruits and
vegetables primarily as a result of new express train service from the pacific
northwest and northern california to eastern markets beverage revenue increased
due to new wine shipments out of california and higher domestic beer carloads
average revenue per car increased primarily due to an increase in longer haul
traffic particularly domestic corn shuttle shipments to california

automotive  revenue increased 13 as a result of a 15 increase in carloads
both revenue and carload totals were alltime records resulting from strong
demand for finished vehicles and parts market share gains and improved rail
service business volume with mexico was particularly strong due to increased
vehicle production levels and more reliable and expanded rail service new
service offerings facilitated the conversion of automotive parts shipments from
truck to the railroad increased container shipments of automotive parts rather
than boxcar shipments caused average revenue per car to decrease slightly

chemicals  a 1 increase in carloads combined with a 2 increase in average
revenue per car led to a 3 increase in revenue revenue growth was driven
primarily by an increase in average revenue per car for soda ash fertilizer
and liquid and dry commodities due to selected price increases yearoveryear
carload improvements came mainly in the first half of the year as a strong
economy and customer plant expansions led to increased market demand for
plastics liquid and dry chemicals and domestic soda ash however a softening
economy late in the year resulted in a 2 decline in fourthquarter revenue
compared to 1999 with weakness in most areas of the chemical market

energy  energy revenue was down 1 compared to 1999 despite a 3 increase in
carloads for the year average revenue per car dropped 4 as a result of
contract pricing provisions with certain major customers in the first six
months of 2000 carloads declined compared to 1999 due to lower coal demand at
utilities resulting from high inventories caused by mild winter weather and year
2000 stockpiles in the second half of 2000 carloads increased over 1999 levels
due to hot summer weather and the combination of cold winter weather late in the
year and a significant increase in the price of alternative fuels delays due to
severe winter weather partially offset volume gains in the second half of the
year

industrial products  revenue increased 5 on a 2 increase in carloads and a 2
increase in average revenue per car a strong economy in the first half of 2000
led to a general increase in demand for most business lines the largest revenue
gains were in steel lumber cement and other building materials due to an
expanding construction market especially in the south and southwest new rail
services and generally improved service performance also contributed to the
increase in carloads starting in the third quarter a softening in the economy
began to adversely affect business demand fourthquarter revenue and carloads
decreased in nearly all business lines but especially minerals steel and
hazardous waste the increase in average revenue per car was due to gains in
higher average revenue per car steel and lumber carloads and selected price
increases during the year

intermodal  revenue increased 11 due to a 7 increase in carloads and a 4
increase in average revenue per car carload growth resulted from a strong us
economy in the first half of 2000 and increased demand for imports from asia
improved service performance led to an increase in carloads and revenue for
expedited premium service new and expanded rail service offerings also
contributed to the gains the increase in average revenue per car was primarily
the result of price increases and a longer average length of haul in some
markets

operating expenses  operating expense increased 510 million 6 to 88
billion in 2000 the higher expenses are primarily the result of significantly
higher fuel prices inflation volume costs associated with a 4 increase in
carloads and higher depreciation expense partially offset by productivity gains
and other cost control measures operating expenses increased 395 million 5
to 87 billion in 2000 excluding the 115 million pretax charge for the work
force reduction plan

salaries wages and employee benefits  salaries wages and employee benefits
increased 19 million 1 to 36 billion costs decreased 96 million 3
excluding the 115 million pretax work force reduction charge the primary
driver was productivity improvements that resulted in lower train crew expenses
despite a 4 increase in carload volume in addition the average employee count
decreased 4 from 1999 to 2000 partially offsetting these gains were increased
costs due to greater rail volume and wage and employee benefit inflation

equipment and other rents  expenses decreased 20 million 2 compared to
1999 the improvement was attributable to lower prices for equipment and
improvements in car cycle times partially offset by higher volumerelated
costs

depreciation  depreciation expense increased 55 million 5 over 1999
resulting from capital spending in recent years capital spending totaled 17
billion in 2000 compared to 18 billion in 1999 and 20 billion in 1998

fuel and utilities  expenses increased 496 million 63 the increase was
driven by significantly higher fuel prices which added 444 million of
additional costs and higher volume fuel prices averaged 90 cents per gallon in
2000 compared to 56 cents per gallon in 1999 including taxes transportation
costs and regional pricing spreads of 13 cents for each of the years the
railroad hedged approximately 10 of its fuel consumption for the year which
decreased fuel costs by 52 million as of december 31 2000 expected fuel
consumption for 2001 was 8 hedged at 68 cents per gallon

excluding taxes transportation costs and regional pricing spreads see note 4
to the consolidated financial statements item 8

materials and supplies  expenses increased 6 million 1 reflecting
volumerelated increases in car and locomotive repairs partially offset by
productivity improvements and cost control measures

casualty costs  costs decreased 15 million 4 compared to 1999 primarily as
a result of lower settlement costs

other costs  expenses decreased 31 million 4 compared to 1999 cost
control productivity gains and lower contract services expenses more than
offset volumerelated cost increases and higher state and local taxes

operating income  operating income increased 81 million 4 to 19 billion
excluding the work force reduction charge operating income increased 196
million 11 to a record 20 billion the operating ratio for 2000 was 823
excluding the work force reduction charge the operating ratio was 812 08
percentage points better than 1999s 820 operating ratio

nonoperating items  other income increased 11 million 10 primarily the
result of higher real estate sales interest expense decreased 26 million 4
primarily as a result of lower average debt levels compared to 1999 excluding
the effect of the work force reduction charge income taxes increased 89
million 19 for the year reflecting higher income levels and 1999 settlements
related to prior tax years

trucking segment

operating revenues  in 2000 trucking revenues rose 51 million 5 to over
11 billion the growth resulted primarily from yield initiatives new services
and the impact of a fuel surcharge assessed due to higher fuel prices partially
offsetting this growth was a 4 decline in tonnage compared to 1999

operating expenses  trucking operating expenses rose 18 million 2 to 11
billion in 2000 salaries wages and employee benefits decreased 1 million as
lower volume lower employment levels and productivity gains offset wage and
benefit inflation fuel and utilities costs increased 23 million 47
primarily as a result of significantly higher fuel prices 90 cents per gallon
average in 2000 compared to 54 cents per gallon average in 1999 including
transportation costs and regional pricing spreads and excluding taxes
overnite hedged 9 of 2000 fuel consumption at an average price of 39 cents per
gallon excluding taxes transportation costs and regional pricing spreads
which decreased costs by 2 million as of december 31 2000 overnite had not
hedged any of its expected 2001 fuel consumption equipment and other rents
increased 2 million 2 primarily due to an increase in purchased
transportation costs in response to the ongoing teamsters activity casualty
costs and other costs decreased 7 million 5 primarily due to lower expenses
related to the teamsters activity and also lower cargo loss and damage
expenses

operating income  trucking operations generated operating income of 53 million
in 2000 compared to 20 million for 1999 the operating ratio improved to
952 compared to 981 in 1999

other product lines

other  operating losses increased by 15 million in 2000 compared to 1999
operating revenues declined 1 million year over year operating expenses
increased 14 million primarily due to increased spending at fenix as part of
its overall strategy of developing new products and services

liquidity and capital resources

financial condition

cash from operations was 20 billion 21 billion and 19 billion in 2001
2000 and 1999 respectively the decrease from 2000 to 2001 is primarily due to
the timing of large cash payments including the payments for the work force

reduction plan the increase from 1999 to 2000 reflects higher income from
continuing operations and decreased cash payouts in 2000 for mergerrelated
expenses and customer claims

    cash used in investing activities was 15 billion in 2001 and 16 billion
in 2000 and 1999 the decrease from 2000 to 2001 is due to reduced capital
spending and higher asset sales in 2001 partially offset by the receipt of cash
dividends in 2000

    cash used in financing activities was 440 million 486 million and 256
million in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively the decrease from 2000 to 2001
reflects higher debt and other financings in 2001 977 million in 2001 versus
509 million in 2000 partially offset by higher debt repayments 12 billion
in 2001 versus 796 million in 2000 the increase from 1999 to 2000 reflects
higher debt repayments 796 million in 2000 versus 692 million in 1999 and
lower financings 509 million in 2000 versus 634 million in 1999

    including the convertible preferred securities see note 7 to the
consolidated financial statements item 8 as an equity instrument the ratio of
debt to total capital employed was 422 451 and 476 at december 31 2001
2000 and 1999 respectively

has an initial term of five years and provisions for renewal for an extended
period subject to agreement between the railroad and lessor at any time during
the lease the railroad may at its option purchase the building at
approximately the amount expended by the lessor to construct the building if

railroad has guaranteed a residual value of approximately 220 million at
december 31 2001 the railroad has guaranteed under certain circumstances a
residual value of less than 10 million

other matters

personal injury  the cost of injuries to employees and others on railroad
property or in accidents involving the trucking segment is charged to expense
based on actuarial estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each
year in 2001 the railroads workrelated injuries that resulted in lost job
time declined 7 compared to 2000 in addition accidents at grade crossings
decreased 6 compared to 2000 annual expenses for the railroads personal
injuryrelated events were 204 million in 2001 reflecting lower than
anticipated settlement costs 207 million in 2000 and 228 million in 1999
compensation for railroad workrelated accidents is governed by the federal
employers liability act fela under fela damages are assessed based on a
finding of fault through litigation or outofcourt settlements the railroad
offers a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for
employees who are injured at work

environmental costs  the corporation generates and transports hazardous and
nonhazardous waste in its current and former operations and is subject to
federal state and local environmental laws and regulations the corporation has
identified approximately 370 active sites at which it is or may be liable for
remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of
environmental requirements this includes 48 sites that are the subject of
actions taken by the us government 28 of which are currently on the superfund
national priorities list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several
liability for the remediation of identified sites consequently the
corporations ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to
other parties in addition to costs relating to its own activities at each site

   when environmental issues have been identified with respect to the property
owned leased or otherwise used in the conduct of the corporations business
the corporation and its consultants perform environmental assessments on such
property the corporation expenses the cost of the assessments as incurred the
corporation accrues the cost of remediation where its obligation is probable and
such costs can be reasonably estimated

   as of december 31 2001 the corporation has a liability of 172 million
accrued for future environmental costs the liability includes future costs for
remediation and restoration of sites as well as for ongoing monitoring costs
but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties cost estimates are
based on information available for each site financial viability of other
potentially responsible parties and existing technology laws and regulations
the corporation believes that it has adequately accrued for its ultimate share
of costs at sites subject to joint and several liability however the ultimate
liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of
potentially responsible parties involved sitespecific cost sharing
arrangements with other potentially responsible parties the degree of
contamination by various wastes the scarcity and quality of volumetric data
related to many of the sites andor the speculative nature of remediation
costs the corporation expects to pay out the majority of the december 31 2001
environmental liability over the next five years funded by cash generated from
operations

   remediation of identified sites previously used in operations used by
tenants or contaminated by former owners required cash spending of 63 million
in 2001 62 million in 2000 and 56 million in 1999 the corporation is also

engaged in reducing emissions spills and migration of hazardous materials and
spent cash of 5 million 8 million and 5 million in 2001 2000 and 1999
respectively for control and prevention in 2002 the corporation anticipates
spending 60 million for remediation and 5 million for control and prevention
the impact of current obligations is not expected to have a material adverse
effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the corporation

labor matters

rail  approximately 87 of the railroads nearly 48000 employees are
represented by 14 major rail unions national negotiations under the railway
labor act to revise the national labor agreements for all crafts began in late
1999 in may 2001 the brotherhood of maintenance of way employees bmwe
ratified a fiveyear agreement which included provisions for an annual wage
increase based on the consumer price index and progressive health and welfare
cost sharing the health and welfare cost sharing was a milestone as the bmwe is
the first union to make significant cost contributions to their health and
welfare plan contract discussions with the remaining unions are either in
negotiation or mediation also during 2001 much of the operating craft unions
focus was on the proposed merger between the united transportation union and the
brotherhood of locomotive engineers ble in a december 2001 revote the ble
resoundingly rejected the merger both operating craft unions have indicated a
desire to complete national negotiations the corporation anticipates
significant progress in 2002

trucking  overnite continues to oppose the efforts of the teamsters to unionize
overnite service centers since the teamsters began their efforts at overnite in
1994 overnite has received 90 petitions for union elections at 66 of its 170
service centers although there have been only nine elections since august 1997
and teamsters representation was rejected in seven of those nine elections
twentytwo service centers representing approximately 14 of overnites nearly
13000 nationwide employee work force have voted for union representation and
the teamsters have been certified and recognized as the bargaining
representative for such employees employees at 18 of these 22 locations have
filed decertification petitions since 1999 elections affecting approximately
400 additional employees are unresolved and there are no elections currently
scheduled additionally proceedings are pending in certain cases where a
teamsters local union lost a representation election to date overnite has not
entered into any collective bargaining agreements with the teamsters who began
a job action on october 24 1999 that has continued into 2002 as of january
19 2002 19 overnite service centers had approximately 369 employees less than
3 of overnites work force who did not report to work despite the work
stoppage overnite has managed to improve its revenue and profitability on a
yearoveryear basis employees at two motor cargo service centers located in
north salt lake utah and reno nevada representing approximately 11 of motor
cargos total work force at 30 service centers are covered by two separate
collective bargaining agreements with unions affiliated with the teamsters
although the agreements cover most of the employees at these two facilities
less than half of these covered employees are actual members of unions

inflation  the cumulative effect of long periods of inflation has significantly
increased asset replacement costs for capitalintensive companies such as the
railroad overnite and motor cargo as a result depreciation charges on an
inflationadjusted basis assuming that all operating assets are replaced at
current price levels would be substantially greater than historically reported
amounts

derivative financial instruments  the corporation and its subsidiaries use
derivative financial instruments which are subject to market risk in limited
instances for other than trading purposes to manage risk related to changes in
fuel prices and to achieve the corporations interest rate objectives the
corporation uses swaps futures andor forward contracts to mitigate adverse
price movements and exposure to variable cash flows the use of these
instruments also limits future gains from favorable movements the corporation
uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate changes and
hedge the exposure to fair value changes the purpose of these programs is to
protect the corporations operating margins and overall profitability from
adverse fuel price changes or interest rate fluctuations

   the corporation may also use fuel swaptions to secure more favorable swap
prices swaptions are swaps that are extendable past their base period at the
option of the counterparty swaptions do not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment and are markedtomarket through the consolidated statements of
income



                                       25

   the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that
hypothetical changes in interest rates or fuel prices could have on the
corporations financial instruments these hypothetical changes do not consider
other factors that could impact actual results

interest rates  the corporation manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floatingrate debt
instruments within its debt portfolio over a given period the mix of fixed and
floatingrate debt is largely managed through the issuance of targeted amounts
of each as debt matures or incremental borrowings are required derivatives are
used in limited circumstances as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix and
hedge the exposure to fair value changes in addition the corporation obtains
flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within its debt
portfolio by issuing callable fixedrate debt securities

   at december 31 2001 and 2000 the corporation had variablerate debt
representing approximately 12 and 6 respectively of its total debt if
variable interest rates average 10 higher in 2002 than the corporations
december 31 2001 variable rate which was approximately 3 the corporations
interest expense would increase by less than 5 million after tax if variable
interest rates had averaged 10 higher in 2001 than the corporations december
31 2000 variable rate the corporations interest expense would have increased
by less than 5 million after tax these amounts were determined by considering
the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the balances of the
corporations variablerate debt at december 31 2001 and 2000 respectively

   in may and august 2001 the corporation entered into interest rate swaps on a
total of 598 million of debt with varying maturity dates extending to november
2004 the swaps allowed the corporation to convert the debt from fixed rates to
variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debts fair value
attributable to the changes in the benchmark interest rate libor the swaps
have been accounted for using the shortcut method as allowed by financial
accounting standards board statement fasb no 133 accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities fas 133 and therefore no ineffectiveness
has been recorded within the corporations consolidated financial statements
the effect of a 10 interest rate increase or decrease in 2002 over the december
31 2001 rates is included in the preceding or succeeding paragraph disclosure
respectively the corporation had not entered into any interest rate swaps at
december 31 2000

   market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in
fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates as of
december 31 2001 and amounts to approximately 226 million at december 31
2001 market risk resulting from a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates
as of december 31 2000 amounted to approximately 307 million at december 31
2000 the fair values of the corporations fixedrate debt were estimated by
considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market
prices and current borrowing rates

fuel  fuel costs are a significant portion of the corporations total operating
expenses as a result of the significance of fuel costs and the historical
volatility of fuel prices the corporations transportation subsidiaries
periodically use swaps futures andor forward contracts to mitigate the impact
of adverse fuel price changes the corporation at times may use swaptions to
secure more favorable swap prices

    as of december 31 2001 expected rail fuel consumption for 2002 is 44
hedged or swaptions are in place at 56 cents per gallon excluding taxes
transportation costs and regional pricing spreads as of december 31 2001
expected rail fuel consumption for 2003 is 5 hedged or swaptions are in place
at 56 cents per gallon excluding taxes transportation costs and regional
pricing spreads for the corporations fuel hedges if rail fuel prices decrease
10 from the december 31 2001 level the corresponding increase in fuel expense
would be approximately 20 million after tax for the corporations swaptions
if rail fuel prices decrease 10 from the december 31 2001 level the
corresponding increase in expense would be approximately 4 million after tax

   as of december 31 2000 the corporation had hedged approximately 8 of its
forecasted 2001 fuel consumption at 68 cents per gallon excluding taxes
transportation costs and regional pricing spreads if rail fuel prices had
decreased 10 from the december 31 2000 level the corresponding increase in
fuel expense would have been approximately 5 million after tax

    as of december 31 2001 expected trucking fuel consumption for 2002 is 16
hedged at 58 cents per gallon excluding taxes transportation costs and regional
pricing spread as of december 31 2001 expected trucking fuel consumption for
2003 is 5 hedged at 58 cents per gallon excluding taxes transportation costs
and regional pricing spreads if trucking fuel prices decrease 10 from the
december 31 2001 level the corresponding increase in fuel expense would be
less than 1 million after tax as of december 31 2000 the trucking segment
had not hedged any expected fuel consumption for 2001

accounting pronouncements  effective january 1 2001 the corporation adopted
fas 133 and fasb no 138 accounting for certain derivative instruments and
certain hedging activities fas 138 fas 133 and fas 138 require that the
changes in fair value of all derivative financial instruments the corporation
uses for fuel or interest rate hedging purposes be recorded in the corporations
consolidated statements of financial position in addition to the extent fuel
hedges are ineffective due to pricing differentials resulting from the
geographic dispersion of the corporations operations income statement
recognition of the ineffective portion of the hedge position may be required
also derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment
per fas 133 and fas 138 may require income statement recognition the adoption
of fas 133 and fas 138 resulted in the recognition of a 2 million asset on
january 1 2001 see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements item 8

    in september 2000 the fasb issued statement no 140 accounting for
transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities

financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities fas 125 fas 140 revises
criteria for accounting for securitizations other financial asset transfers and
collateral and introduces new disclosures fas 140 was effective for fiscal 2000
with respect to the new disclosure requirements and amendments of the collateral
provisions originally presented in fas 125 all other provisions were effective
for transfers of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring
after march 31 2001 the provisions are to be applied prospectively with
certain exceptions the adoption of fas 140 did not have a significant impact on
the corporations consolidated financial statements

   in july 2001 the fasb issued statement no 141 business combinations fas
141 fas 141 revises the method of accounting for business combinations and
eliminates the pooling method of accounting fas 141 was effective for all
business combinations that were initiated or completed after june 30 2001
management believes that fas 141 will not have a material impact on the
corporations consolidated financial statements

    also in july 2001 the fasb issued statement no 142 goodwill and other
intangible assets fas 142 fas 142 revises the method of accounting for
goodwill and other intangible assets fas 142 eliminates the amortization of
goodwill but requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at least annually at
a reporting unit level fas 142 is effective for the corporations fiscal year
beginning january 1 2002 management believes that fas 142 will not have a
material impact on the corporations consolidated financial statements in
accordance with fas 142 the corporation will eliminate annual goodwill
amortization of 2 million at december 31 2001 the corporation had 50
million of goodwill remaining

   in august 2001 the fasb issued statement no 143 accounting for asset
retirement obligations fas 143 fas 143 is effective for the corporations
fiscal year beginning january 1 2003 and requires the corporation to record
the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period
in which it is incurred management is in the process of evaluating the impact
this standard will have on the corporations consolidated financial statements

   in addition in october 2001 the fasb issued statement no 144 accounting
for the impairment of disposal of longlived assets fas 144 fas 144 replaces
fasb statement no 121 accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and
for longlived assets to be disposed of fas 121 fas 144 develops one
accounting model based on the framework established in fas 121 for longlived
assets to be disposed of by sale the accounting model applies to all longlived
assets including discontinued operations and it replaces the provisions of apb
opinion no 30 reporting results of operationsreporting the effects of
disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary unusual and infrequently
occurring events and transactions for disposal of segments of a business fas
144 requires that longlived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount
or fair value less cost to sell whether reported in continuing operations or in
discontinued operations fas 144 also broadens the definition of discontinued
operations fas 144 is

a look forward

2002 business outlook

rail  the railroad expects to build on the positive momentum generated in the
past several years and continue to grow revenue earnings and free cash flow
free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash
used in investing activities and dividends paid the impact in 2001 of economic
recession and declining industrial production is expected to subside in the
latter half of 2002 yearoveryear revenue growth is projected in the
economically sensitive intermodal chemical and industrial products commodity
segments agricultural products notably wheat is also expected to improve
energy revenue is expected to decline slightly from the record setting pace of
2001 automotive revenue is also expected to decrease however new contracts in
the automotive sector are expected to help mitigate this decline and
therefore the automotive sector should continue to be a strong revenue
provider the railroad will continue to focus on improving service performance
and developing new innovative rail service offerings to meet the changing needs
of its customers cost control and continuing improvements in productivity
should help drive the operating ratio lower fuel prices are expected to be
substantially below the levels of the past two years but will still be
susceptible to volatile price swings to help reduce the impact of fuel price
volatility on earnings the railroad will continue to look for opportunities to
use hedge contracts

    on december 21 2001 the railroad retirement and survivors improvement act
of 2001 the act was signed into law the act was a result of historic
cooperation between rail management and labor and provides improved railroad
retirement benefits for employees and reduced payroll taxes for employers
although the exact impact is not yet known the railroad anticipates that the
phasedin tax reductions will have a beneficial impact on its financial results
in the future

trucking  overnite expects financial performance to improve in the second half
of 2002 following difficult economic conditions during the first half of the
year operating expenses are projected to be positively impacted by lower fuel
prices cost control and productivity improvements which will mitigate the
impact of inflationary pressures overnite will continue to offer reliable
ontime performance and quality service which should enable overnite to
maintain profitable margins the addition of motor cargo will enable the
trucking segment to provide expanded regional coverage in the western united
states

2002 capital investments

the corporations 2002 capital expenditures and debt service requirements are
expected to be funded through cash generated from operations additional debt
financings and the sale or lease of various operating and nonoperating
properties the corporation expects that these sources will continue to provide
sufficient funds to meet cash requirements in the foreseeable future in 2002
the railroad expects to spend approximately 17 billion on capital
expenditures these capital expenditures will be used to maintain track and
structures continue capacity expansions on its main lines upgrade and augment
equipment to better meet customer needs build infrastructure and develop and
implement new technologies overnite and motor cargo will continue to maintain
their truck fleet expand service centers and enhance technology

corporate structure

union pacific corporation upc or the corporation was incorporated in utah in
1969 the corporation operates primarily in the areas of rail transportation
through its subsidiary union pacific railroad company the railroad and
trucking through its subsidiary overnite transportation company

     in 2000 the corporation continued to focus on its core rail transportation
business by investing approximately 17 billion in capitalrelated assets at
the railroad the capital assets are used to sustain current operations and
introduce innovative rail services across every commodity line the
corporations rail investments in the last five years included the 1996
acquisition of southern pacific rail corporation southern pacific and the
1997 and 1999 investments in the pacificnorth and chihuahua pacific lines in
mexico the details of the corporations key strategic transactions in recent
years are as follows

fenix  during 2000 the corporation announced the formation of a new
subsidiary fenix to develop and expand the corporations technology and
telecommunication assets beyond the corporations core transportation
businesses

mexican railway concession  during 1997 the railroad and a consortium of
partners were granted a 50year concession to operate the pacificnorth and
chihuahua pacific lines in mexico and a 25 stake in the mexico city terminal
company at a price of 525 million the consortium assumed operational control
of both lines in 1998 in march 1999 the railroad purchased an additional 13
ownership interest for 87 million from one of its partners the railroad
currently holds a 26 ownership share in the consortium this investment is
accounted for using the equity method of accounting

overnite  in may 1998 the corporations board of directors approved a formal
plan to divest of upcs investment in overnite through an initial public
offering however market conditions deteriorated to the point that upc did not
consummate the offering see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in
the annual report

skyway  in november 1998 the corporation completed the sale of skyway freight
systems inc skyway a wholly owned subsidiary skyway provided contract
logistics and supply chain management services the proceeds were used to repay
outstanding debt the sale of skyway generated a net aftertax loss of 50
million see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in the annual
report

southern pacific  during 2000 upc continued its integration of southern
pacifics rail operations this process is expected to be completed in 2001 see
notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report
upc consummated the acquisition of southern pacific in september 1996 for 41
billion sixty percent of the outstanding southern pacific common shares were
converted into upc common stock and the remaining 40 of the outstanding shares
were acquired for cash upc initially funded the cash portion of the acquisition
with credit facility borrowings all of which have been subsequently refinanced
with other borrowings the acquisition of southern pacific has been accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting

federal state and local regulations the most significant areas of regulation
are described below see also the discussion of certain regulatory proceedings
in item 3 legal proceedings which is incorporated herein by reference

jurisdiction of the stb and other federal and state agencies the stb has
jurisdiction over rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic freight car
compensation transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines and acquisition
of control of rail and motor carriers by rail common carriers in march 2000

activities for 15 months until the stb adopts new rules governing merger
proceedings the rulemaking proceeding is scheduled to be completed by june 11
2001

     other federal agencies have jurisdiction over safety movement of hazardous
materials movement and disposal of hazardous waste and equipment standards
various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous
wastes and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials

environmental regulation  upc and its subsidiaries are subject to various
environmental statutes and regulations including the resource conservation and
recovery act rcra the comprehensive environmental response compensation and
liability act of 1980 cercla and the clean air act caa

     rcra applies to hazardous waste generators and transporters as well as to
persons engaged in treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and specifies
standards for storage areas treatment units and land disposal units all
generators of hazardous waste are required to label shipments in accordance with
detailed regulations and to prepare a


                                      4
page   5



detailed manifest identifying the material and stating its destination before
waste can be released for offsite transport the transporter must deliver the
hazardous waste in accordance with the manifest and only to a treatment storage
or disposal facility qualified for rcra interim status or having a final rcra
permit

     the environmental protection agency epa regulations under rcra have
established a comprehensive system for the management of hazardous waste these
regulations identify a wide range of industrial byproducts and residues as
hazardous waste and specify requirements for cradletograve management of
such waste from the time of generation through the time of disposal and beyond
states that have adopted hazardous waste management programs with standards at
least as stringent as those promulgated by the epa may be authorized by the epa
to administer all or part of rcra on behalf of the epa

     cercla was designed to establish a strategy for cleaning up facilities at
which hazardous waste or other hazardous substances have created actual or
potential environmental hazards the epa has designated certain facilities as
requiring cleanup or further assessment among other things cercla authorizes
the federal government either to clean up such facilities itself or to order
persons responsible for the situation to do so the act created a multibillion
dollar fund to be used by the federal government to pay for such cleanup
efforts in the event the federal government pays for such cleanup it will seek
reimbursement from private parties upon which cercla imposes liability

     cercla imposes strict liability on the owners and operators of facilities
in which hazardous waste and other hazardous substances are deposited or from
which they are released or are likely to be released into the environment it
also imposes strict liability on the generators of such waste and the
transporters of the waste who select the disposal or treatment sites liability
may include cleanup costs incurred by third persons and damage to publicly owned
natural resources the company is subject to potential liability under cercla as
an owner or operator of facilities at which hazardous substances have been
disposed of or as a generator or a transporter of hazardous substances disposed
of at other locations some states have enacted and other states are
considering enacting legislation similar to cercla certain provisions of these
acts are more stringent than cercla states that have passed such legislation
are currently active in designating more facilities as requiring cleanup and
further assessment

     the operations of the corporation are subject to the requirements of the
caa the 1990 amendments to the caa include a provision under title v requiring
that certain facilities obtain operating permits epa regulations require all
states to develop federallyapprovable permit programs affected facilities must
submit air operating permit applications to the respective states within one
year of the epas approval of the state programs certain of the corporations
facilities may be required to obtain such permits in addition in december 1997
the epa issued final regulations which require that certain purchased and
remanufactured locomotives meet stringent emissions criteria while the cost of
meeting these requirements may be significant expenditures are not expected to
affect materially the corporations financial condition or results of
operations

acquisition of control of southern pacific by upc subject to various
conditions the acquisition was consummated on september 11 1996 various
appeals were filed with respect to the decision and all such appeals were
ultimately consolidated in the us court of appeals for the district of
columbia circuit and all of the appeals have since been withdrawn or denied

     among the conditions to the stbs approval of the southern pacific
acquisition was the requirement that the stb retain oversight jurisdiction for
five years to examine whether the conditions imposed under the decision remain
effective to address the competitive harms caused by the merger on december 15
2000 the stb served a decision in the fourth annual general oversight
proceeding to review the implementation of the merger and the effectiveness of

shareholder litigation

as previously reported upc and certain of its directors and officers who are
also directors of the railroad were named as defendants in two purported class
actions filed in 1997 that have been consolidated into one proceeding in the
united states district court for the northern district of texas the class
action in addition to the class action a purported derivative action was
filed on behalf of upc and the railroad in september 1998 in the district court
for tarrant county texas naming as defendants the thencurrent and certain
former directors of upc and the railroad and as nominal defendants upc and the
railroad the derivative action and together with the class action the
actions

     prior to any rulings on the defendants motions to dismiss the class action
and the derivative action counsel for upc the railroad and the individual
defendants in those actions entered into a memorandum of understanding the
mou dated june 28 2000 with counsel for the plaintiffs in the class action
and derivative action providing for the settlement of both actions the mou
provided among other things that the class action would be settled for
34025000 in cash the settlement payment the full amount of which has been
covered by upcs insurance carriers the mou also provided that in settlement
of the derivative action upc would adopt certain additional procedures which
are intended to reinforce its continuing effort to ensure both the effective
implementation of its merger with southern pacific and its ongoing commitment to
rail safety in addition in the event of any proposed merger or other
transaction involving consolidation of upc and a rail system of greater than
1000 miles in length of road upc agreed to commission a study to be completed
in advance of any formal application to a us canadian or mexican federal
regulatory board to analyze prospective safety and congestionrelated issues

     on october 12 2000 counsel for the respective parties in the class action
and the derivative action entered into definitive stipulations of compromise and
settlement the stipulations providing for the settlement of the actions on
the terms described above subject to court approval at separate hearings on
december 13 2000 the court in the class action and the court in the derivative
action approved the proposed settlement of the respective actions as fair
adequate and reasonable and dismissed the respective actions with prejudice in
favor of the defendants in its order the court in the class action also
granted in part plaintiffs counsels application for attorneys fees and
expenses to be paid from the settlement payment in its order the court in the
derivative action also granted plaintiffs counsels application for attorneys
fees and expenses in the amount of 975000 which amount has been paid by the
corporation but has been fully covered by upcs insurance carriers

     upc the railroad and the individual defendants named in the actions
entered into the mou and stipulations solely for the purpose of avoiding the
further expense inconvenience burden and uncertainty of the actions and their
decision to do so does not constitute and under the terms of the stipulations
may not be taken as an admission or concession or evidence of any liability or
wrongdoing whatsoever on the part of any party to either action which liability
and wrongdoing have consistently been and continue to be denied

surface transportation board matters

         as previously reported in may 2000 the stb dismissed a complaint filed
by the western coal traffic league wctl alleging that the railroad improperly
accounted for certain costs associated with the acquisition of southern pacific
and service difficulties in its 1997 annual report filed with the stb on june
1 2000 the wctl petitioned the stb for a rehearing on november 30 2000 the
stb rejected wctls petition for reconsideration and affirmed its earlier
decision issued in may of 2000 that the railroad properly accounted for the
service difficulties experienced in 1997


                                      7
page   8



     also as previously reported in may 2000 the stb served a decision in a
complaint filed by fmc challenging the railroads tariff rates on 16 different
movements the decision found rates on 15 of the movements were excessive on
june 1 2000 the railroad petitioned the stb for reconsideration alleging that
multiple errors caused the decision to understate costs and therefore prescribe
rates where not jurisdictionally permitted or prescribe lower rates than
warranted the railroad and fmc each also filed a petition for review of the stb
decision in the united states circuit court of appeals for the dc circuit
although both fmc and the railroad originally challenged the stb decision both
parties agreed that neither party would pursue future appeals or regulatory
action as part of a wider commercial understanding reached on december 8 2000
when the railroad notified the stb that it was withdrawing its motion for
reconsideration the stb dismissed the motion and discontinued the proceeding in
a decision served december 13 2000 the parties agreed upon an amount to be
paid in final reparations and interest and the railroad paid the final
installment on december 15 2000

other matters

western resources v union pacific railroad company and the burlington northern
santa fe railway company western resources western filed its original
complaint on january 24 2000 in the us district court for the district of
kansas western alleged the railroads materially breached their service
obligations under the transportation contract to deliver coal in a timely manner
to westerns jeffrey energy center the original complaint sought recovery of
consequential damages and termination of the contract excusing western from
further performance in an amended complaint filed september 1 2000 western
claimed the right to retroactive termination and added a claim for restitution
in its december 1 2000 supplemental disclosure of damages western continued to
assert both its damages and restitution claims

     the railroads are vigorously defending this lawsuit and discovery is
underway the railroads have filed two motions seeking dismissal of the
termination and restitution claims western has responded and the railroads
have replied the trial is currently scheduled to begin in may 2002

labor matters

the general counsel of the national labor relations board nlrb is seeking a
bargaining order remedy in 11 cases involving overnite where a teamsters local
union lost a representation election a bargaining order remedy would require
overnite to recognize and bargain with the union as if the union had won instead
of lost the election and would be warranted only if the following findings are
made 1 the petitioning teamsters local had obtained valid authorization cards
from a majority of the employees in an appropriate unit 2 overnite committed
serious unfair labor practices and 3 those unfair labor practices would
preclude the holding of a fair election despite the application of less drastic
remedies in these eleven cases an administrative law judge has ruled that the
bargaining order remedy is warranted overnite appealed those rulings to the
nlrb the nlrb has upheld the decision of the administrative law judge in four
cases and overnite has appealed the nlrbs ruling to the united states court of
appeals for the fourth circuit on february 16 2001 a twoone majority of a
fourth circuit panel enforced the nlrb bargaining orders overnite will petition
for rehearing by the entire circuit bench with respect to the other seven
bargaining order cases overnites appeal is pending before the nlrb in a
twelfth case the administrative law judge found that a bargaining order remedy
was not warranted under nlrb case law a bargaining order remedy would attach
retrospectively to the date when after a union with a showing of majority
support demanded recognition overnite embarked on an unlawful course of
conduct in the event of such a retroactive effective bargaining order overnite
would face back pay liability for losses in employee earnings due to unilateral
changes in terms or conditions of employment such as layoffs reduced hours of
work or less remunerative work assignments overnite believes it has substantial
defenses in the bargaining order cases and intends to continue to defend them
aggressively

environmental matters

in march 1998 the railroad received notice that the railroad and clean harbors
a waste disposal firm were the subjects of a criminal investigation by the epa
and the federal bureau of investigation tank cars containing hazardous waste
billed to clean harbors transload facility in sterling colorado were held in
the railroads sterling colorado rail yard for periods longer than ten days
prior to placement in clean harbors facility allegedly in violation of
hazardous waste regulations the railroad is cooperating with the investigation
and has responded to grand jury subpoenas a finding of violation could result
in significant criminal or civil penalties

     the corporation and its affiliates have received notices from the epa and
state environmental agencies alleging that they are or may be liable under
certain federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various
sites throughout the united states including sites which are on the superfund
national priorities list or state superfund lists although specific claims have
been made by the epa and state regulators with respect to some of these sites
the ultimate impact of these proceedings and suits by third parties cannot be
predicted at this time because of the number of potentially responsible parties
involved the degree of contamination by various wastes the scarcity and
quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites andor the speculative
nature of remediation costs nevertheless at many of the superfund sites the
corporation believes it will have little or no exposure because no liability
should be imposed under applicable law one or more other financially able
parties generated all or most of the contamination or a settlement of the
corporations exposure has been reached although regulatory proceedings at the
sites involved have not been formally terminated

     information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated
attendant remediation costs is set forth in managements discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operations  other matters  environmental
costs on pages 28 and 29 of the annual report such information is incorporated
