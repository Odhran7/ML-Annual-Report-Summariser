 item 1 business 

general 

linde plc is a public limited company formed under the laws of ireland with its principal offices in the united kingdom and united states linde is the largest industrial gas company worldwide and is a major technological innovator in the industrial gases industry its primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases oxygen nitrogen argon and rare gases and process gases carbon dioxide helium hydrogen electronic gases specialty gases and acetylene the company also designs and builds equipment that produces industrial gases and offers customers a wide range of gas production and processing services such as olefin plants natural gas plants air separation plants hydrogen and synthesis gas plants and other types of plants 

linde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare chemicals and energy manufacturing metals and mining food and beverage and electronics 

linde’s sales were 30793 million 27243 million and 28228 million for 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis for a discussion of consolidated sales and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to linde’s reportable segments 

industrial gases products and manufacturing processes 

atmospheric gases are the highest volume products produced by linde using air as its raw material linde produces oxygen nitrogen and argon through several air separation processes of which cryogenic air separation is the most prevalent rare gases such as krypton neon and xenon are also produced through cryogenic air separation as a pioneer in the industrial gases industry linde is a leader in developing a wide range of proprietary and patented applications and supply systems technology linde also led the development and commercialization of noncryogenic air separation technologies for the production of industrial gases these technologies open important new markets and optimize production capacity for the company by lowering the cost of supplying industrial gases these technologies include proprietary vacuum pressure swing adsorption “vpsa” and membrane separation to produce gaseous oxygen and nitrogen respectively 

process gases including carbon dioxide hydrogen carbon monoxide helium specialty gases and acetylene are produced by methods other than air separation most carbon dioxide is purchased from byproduct sources including chemical plants refineries and industrial processes or is recovered from carbon dioxide wells carbon dioxide is processed in linde’s plants to produce commercial and foodgrade carbon dioxide 

hydrogen is produced from a range of feedstocks using an array of different technologies despite hydrogen being an invisible molecule colors are often used to designate and differentiate between the production processes used to produce the molecule the vast majority of hydrogen currently produced by linde is what is termed gray hydrogen and is derived from natural gas or methane using steam methane reformation technology linde has multiple technologies to produce other types of hydrogen including blue and green which are both considered types of clean energy blue hydrogen is produced by capturing the carbon emissions from the hydrogen plant and either utilizing them in a way that stops them from being emitted or sequestering them in the subsurface for the long term green hydrogen is produced by electrolysis using renewable energy or from the steam methane reforming of biomethane low carbon intensity highpurity hydrogen is also produced by purifying and recovering byproduct hydrogen sources from the chemical and petrochemical industries 

helium is sourced from certain heliumrich natural gas streams in the united states with additional supplies being acquired from outside the united states carbon monoxide can be produced by either steam methane reforming or autothermal reforming of natural gas or other feed streams such as naphtha acetylene is primarily sourced as a chemical byproduct but may also be produced from calcium carbide and water 

industrial gases distribution 

there are three basic distribution methods for industrial gases i onsite or tonnage ii merchant or bulk liquid and iii packaged or cylinder gases these distribution methods are often integrated with products from all three supply modes coming from the same plant the method of supply is generally determined by the lowest cost means of meeting the customer’s needs depending upon factors such as volume requirements purity pattern of usage and the form in which the product is used as a gas or as a cryogenic liquid 

onsite customers that require the largest volumes of product typically oxygen nitrogen and hydrogen and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas onsite plants linde constructs plants on or 

adjacent to these customers’ sites and supplies the product directly to customers by pipeline onsite product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 1020 years and containing minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions many of the cryogenic onsite plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market therefore plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer advanced air separation processes allow onsite delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements 

merchant the merchant business is generally associated with distributable liquid oxygen nitrogen argon carbon dioxide hydrogen and helium the deliveries generally are made from linde’s plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customers site which are owned and maintained by linde and leased to the customer due to distribution cost merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced merchant argon hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances the customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three to sevenyear requirement contracts 

packaged gases customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in metal containers called cylinders under medium to high pressure packaged gases include atmospheric gases carbon dioxide hydrogen helium acetylene and related products linde also produces and distributes in cylinders a wide range of specialty gases and mixtures cylinders may be delivered to the customer’s site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store packaged gases are generally sold under one to threeyear supply contracts and through purchase orders 

engineering 

linde’s engineering business has a global presence with its focus on market segments such as olefin natural gas air separation hydrogen and synthesis gas plants the company utilizes its extensive process engineering knowhow in the planning design and construction of highly efficient turnkey plants for the production and processing of gases with its stateoftheart sustainable technologies engineering helps customers avoid capture and utilize co2 emissions its technology portfolio covers the entire value chain for production liquefaction storage distribution and application of hydrogen which supports the transition to clean energy its digital services and solutions increase plant efficiency and performance 

lindes plants are used in a wide variety of fields in the petrochemical and chemical industries in refineries and fertilizer plants to recover air gases to produce synthesis gases to treat natural gas and to produce noble gases the engineering business either supplies plant components directly to the customer or to the industrial gas business of linde which operates the plants under a longterm gases supply contract 

inventories – linde carries inventories of merchant and cylinder gases and hardgoods to supply products to its customers on a reasonable delivery schedule onsite plants and pipeline complexes have limited inventory inventory obsolescence is not material to linde’s business 

customers – linde is not dependent upon a single customer or a few customers 

international – linde is a global enterprise with approximately 70 of its 2021 sales outside of the united states the company also has majority or wholly owned subsidiaries that operate in approximately 45 european middle eastern and african countries including germany france sweden the republic of south africa and the united kingdom uk approximately 20 asian and south pacific countries including china australia india south korea and thailand and approximately 20 countries in north and south america including canada mexico and brazil 

the company also has equity method investments operating in europe asia africa the middle east and north america 

linde’s nonus business is subject to risks customarily encountered in nonus operations including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates import and export controls and other economic political and regulatory policies of local governments also see item 1a “risk factors” and item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

seasonality – linde’s business is generally not subject to seasonal fluctuations to any significant extent 

research and development – linde’s research and development is directed toward development of gas processing separation and liquefaction technologies and clean energy technologies improving distribution of industrial gases and the development of new markets and applications for these gases this results in the development of new advanced air separation hydrogen synthesis gas natural gas adsorption and chemical process technologies novel clean energy and carbon management solutions as well as the frequent introduction of new industrial gas applications research and 

development is primarily conducted at munich germany tonawanda new york burr ridge illinois and shanghai china 

patents and trademarks – linde owns or licenses a large number of patents that relate to a wide variety of products and processes linde’s patents expire at various times over the next 20 years while these patents and licenses are considered important to its individual businesses linde does not consider its business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any one particular patent or patent license or family of patents linde also owns a large number of trademarks of which the linde trademark is the most significant 

raw materials and energy costs – energy is the single largest cost item in the production and distribution of industrial gases most of linde’s energy requirements are in the form of electricity natural gas and diesel fuel for distribution the company mitigates electricity natural gas and hydrocarbon price fluctuations contractually through pricing formulas surcharges and cost pass–through and tolling arrangements 

the supply of energy has not been a significant issue in the geographic areas where the company conducts business however energy availability and price is unpredictable and may pose unforeseen future risks 

for carbon dioxide carbon monoxide helium hydrogen and specialty gases raw materials are largely purchased from outside sources linde has contracts or commitments for or readily available sources of most of these raw materials however their longterm availability and prices are subject to market conditions 

competition – linde participates in highly competitive markets in industrial gases and engineering which are characterized by a mixture of local regional and global players all of which exert competitive pressure on the parties in locations where linde has pipeline networks which enable the company to provide reliable and economic supply of products to larger customers linde derives a competitive advantage 

competitors in the industrial gases industry include global and regional companies such as l’air liquide sa air products and chemicals inc messer group gmbh mitsubishi chemical holdings corporation through taiyo nippon sanso corporation as well as an extensive number of small to medium size independent industrial gas companies which compete locally as producers or distributors in addition a significant portion of the international gases market relates to customerowned plants 

employees – the company sources talent from an everchanging and competitive environment the ability to source and retain qualified and committed employees is a prerequisite for the company’s success and represents a general risk for linde 

the board of directors board has established a strategic business objective to maintain worldclass standards in talent management executive variable compensation is assessed annually based on performance in several strategic nonfinancial areas including talent management the human capital committee assists the board in its oversight of linde’s compensation and incentive policies and programs and management development and succession particularly in regard to reviewing executive compensation for linde’s executive officers the human capital committee also periodically reviews the company’s diversity policies and objectives and programs to achieve those objectives the global head of human resources reports to the chief executive officer ceo a global leader of diversity and inclusion reports to the head of human resources 

linde has aligned diversity and inclusion with its business strategies and implemented diversity action planning into business process and performance management diversity and inclusion are line management responsibilities and linde seeks competitive advantage through proactive management of its talent pipeline procurement and recruiting processes linde provides equal employment opportunity and recruits hires promotes and compensates people based solely on their merit and ability 

employees receive a competitive salary and variable compensation components based on merit and depending on their position linde has collective bargaining agreements with unions at numerous locations throughout the world additional benefits are offered such as occupational pensions and contributions towards health insurance or medical screening reflecting regional conditions and local competition managers’ compensation is based on performance senior managers participate directly in the company’s growth in value through the long term incentive plan of linde plc from time to time linde may introduce special compensation schemes to recognize or reward specific individuals such as the one implemented in 2020 for global frontline employees worklife balance is promoted by providing a range of opportunities that are based on the overall local conditions linde also invests in professional development of its employees through formal and onthejob training 

as of december 31 2021 linde had 72327 employees worldwide comprised of approximately 27 percent women and 73 percent men  the total professional workforce comprised of approximately 28 percent women and 72 percent men

 item 1a risk factors 

due to the size and geographic reach of the company’s operations a wide range of factors many of which are outside of the company’s control could materially affect the company’s future operations and financial performance management believes the following risks may significantly impact the company 

the covid19 global pandemic could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

the covid19 global pandemic including resurgences and variants of the virus that causes covid19 and efforts to reduce its spread have led and may continue to lead to significant changes in levels of economic activity and significant disruption and volatility in global markets covid19 has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and shutdowns these measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations the operations of our customers vendors and suppliers there is considerable uncertainty regarding such measures and potential future measures and restrictions on our access to our manufacturing facilities or on our support operations or workforce or similar limitations for our vendors and suppliers and restrictions or disruptions of transportation such as reduced availability of air transport port closures and increased border controls or closures could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations these restrictions and disruptions could affect our performance on our contracts 

furthermore covid19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries including negatively impacting economic growth the proper functioning of financial and capital markets foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates risks related to economic conditions are described in our principal risks and uncertainties titled “weakening economic conditions in markets in which linde does business may adversely impact its financial results andor cash flows” and “macroeconomic factors may impact linde’s ability to obtain financing or increase the cost of obtaining financing which may adversely impact linde’s financial results andor cash flows 

weakening economic conditions in markets in which linde does business may adversely impact its financial results andor cash flows 

linde serves a diverse group of industries across more than 100 countries which generally leads to financial stability through various business cycles however a broad decline in general economic or business conditions in the industries served by its customers could adversely affect the demand for linde’s products and impair the ability of its customers to satisfy their obligations to linde resulting in uncollected receivables andor unanticipated contract terminations or project delays for example global political and economic uncertainty could reduce investment activities of linde’s customers which could adversely affect linde’s business 

in addition many of linde’s customers are in businesses that are cyclical in nature such as the chemicals metals and energy industries downturns in these industries may adversely impact linde during these cycles additionally such conditions could impact the utilization of linde’s manufacturing capacity which may require it to recognize impairment losses on tangible assets such as property plant and equipment as well as intangible assets such as goodwill customer relationships or intellectual property 

increases in the cost of energy and raw materials andor disruption in the supply of these materials could result in lost sales or reduced profitability 

energy is the single largest cost item in the production and distribution of industrial gases most of linde’s energy requirements are in the form of electricity natural gas and diesel fuel for distribution linde attempts to minimize the financial impact of variability in these costs through the management of customer contracts and reducing demand through operational productivity and energy efficiency large customer contracts typically have escalation and passthrough clauses to recover energy and feedstock costs such attempts may not successfully mitigate cost variability which could negatively impact linde’s financial condition or results of operations the supply of energy has not been a significant issue in the geographic areas where linde conducts business however regional energy conditions are unpredictable and may pose future risk 

for carbon dioxide carbon monoxide helium hydrogen and specialty gases raw materials are largely purchased from outside sources where feasible linde sources several of these raw materials including carbon dioxide hydrogen and calcium carbide as chemical or industrial byproducts in addition linde has contracts or commitments for or readily 

available sources of most of these raw materials however their longterm availability and prices are subject to market conditions a disruption in supply of such raw materials could impact linde’s ability to meet contractual supply commitments 

linde’s international operations are subject to the risks of doing business abroad and international events and circumstances may adversely impact its business financial condition or results of operations 

linde has substantial international operations which are subject to risks including devaluations in currency exchange rates transportation delays and interruptions political and economic instability and disruptions restrictions on the transfer of funds trade conflicts and the imposition of duties and tariffs import and export controls changes in governmental policies labor unrest possible nationalization andor expropriation of assets changes in us and nonus tax policies and compliance with governmental regulations these events could have an adverse effect on the international operations of linde in the future by reducing the demand for its products decreasing the prices at which it can sell its products reducing the revenue from international operations or otherwise having an adverse effect on its business 

currency exchange rate fluctuations and other related risks may adversely affect lindes results 

because a significant portion of lindes revenue is denominated in currencies other than its reporting currency the us dollar changes in exchange rates will produce fluctuations in revenue costs and earnings and may also affect the book value of assets and liabilities and related equity although the company from time to time utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these exposures its efforts to minimize currency exposure through such hedging transactions may not be successful depending on market and business conditions as a result fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect linde’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

macroeconomic factors may impact linde’s ability to obtain financing or increase the cost of obtaining financing which may adversely impact linde’s financial results andor cash flows 

volatility and disruption in the us european and global credit and equity markets from time to time could make it more difficult for linde to obtain financing for its operations andor could increase the cost of obtaining financing in addition linde’s borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on its performance as measured by certain criteria such as interest coverage and leverage ratios a decrease in these debt ratings could increase the cost of borrowing or make it more difficult to obtain financing 

an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets could negatively impact the companys financial results 

as of december 31 2021 the net carrying value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets was 27 billion and 2 billion respectively primarily as a result of the business combination and the related acquisition method of accounting applied to linde ag in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the company periodically assesses these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and sustained market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairments to goodwill or other indefinitelived assets any charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse impact on lindes results of operations in the periods recognized 

catastrophic events could disrupt the operations of linde andor its customers and suppliers and may have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations 

the occurrence of catastrophic events or natural disasters such as extreme weather including hurricanes and floods health epidemics and acts of war or terrorism could disrupt or delay linde’s ability to produce and distribute its products to customers and could potentially expose linde to thirdparty liability claims in addition such events could impact linde’s customers and suppliers resulting in temporary or longterm outages andor the limitation of supply of energy and other raw materials used in normal business operations linde evaluates the direct and indirect business risks consults with vendors insurance providers and industry experts makes investments in suitably resilient design and technology and conducts regular reviews of the business risks with management despite these steps however these situations are outside linde’s control and may have a significant adverse impact on its financial results 

the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel may adversely impact linde’s business 

if linde fails to attract hire and retain qualified personnel it may not be able to develop market or sell its products or successfully manage its business linde is dependent upon a highly skilled experienced and efficient workforce to be successful much of linde’s competitive advantage is based on the expertise and experience of key personnel regarding marketing technology manufacturing and distribution infrastructure systems and products the inability to attract and hire qualified individuals or the loss of key employees in very skilled areas could have a negative effect on linde’s financial results 

if linde fails to keep pace with technological advances in the industry or if new technology initiatives do not become commercially accepted customers may not continue to buy linde’s products and results of operations could be adversely affected 

linde’s research and development is directed toward developing new and improved methods for the production and distribution of industrial gases the design and construction of plants and toward developing new markets and applications for the use of industrial and process gases this results in the introduction of new applications and the development of new advanced process technologies as a result of these efforts linde develops new and proprietary technologies and employs necessary measures to protect such technologies within the global geographies in which linde operates these technologies help linde to create a competitive advantage and to provide a platform to grow its business if linde’s research and development activities do not keep pace with competitors or if linde does not create new technologies that benefit customers future results of operations could be adversely affected 

risks related to pension benefit plans may adversely impact linde’s results of operations and cash flows 

pension benefits represent significant financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments and asset returns significant estimates are required to calculate pension expense and liabilities related to linde’s plans linde utilizes the services of independent actuaries whose models are used to facilitate these calculations several key assumptions are used in the actuarial models to calculate pension expense and liability amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements in particular significant changes in actual investment returns on pension assets discount rates or legislative or regulatory changes could impact future results of operations and required pension contributions 

operational risks may adversely impact linde’s business or results of operations 

linde’s operating results are dependent on the continued operation of its production facilities and its ability to meet customer contract requirements and other needs insufficient or excess capacity threatens linde’s ability to generate competitive profit margins and may expose linde to liabilities related to contract commitments operating results are also dependent on linde’s ability to complete new construction projects on time on budget and in accordance with performance requirements failure to do so may expose linde’s business to loss of revenue potential litigation and loss of business reputation 

also inherent in the management of linde’s production facilities and delivery systems including storage vehicle transportation and pipelines are operational risks that require continuous training oversight and control material operating failures at production storage facilities or pipelines including fire toxic release and explosions or the occurrence of vehicle transportation accidents could result in loss of life damage to the environment loss of production andor extensive property damage all of which may negatively impact linde’s financial results 

linde may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions and breaches in data security 

linde relies on information technology systems and networks for business and operational activities and also stores and processes sensitive business and proprietary information in these systems and networks these systems are susceptible to outages due to fire flood power loss telecommunications failures viruses breakins and similar events or breaches of security 

linde has taken steps to address these risks and concerns by implementing advanced security technologies internal controls network and data center resiliency and recovery process despite these steps however our information technology systems have in the past been and in the future will likely be subject to increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks 

operational failures and breaches of security from such attempts could lead to the loss or disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to linde or our employees and customers or suppliers these failures and breaches could result in business interruption or malfunction and lead to legal or regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on linde’s operations reputation and financial results to date such attempts have not had any significant impact on lindes operations or financial results 

the inability to effectively integrate acquisitions or collaborate with joint venture partners could adversely impact linde’s financial position and results of operations 

linde has evaluated and expects to continue to evaluate a wide array of potential strategic acquisitions and joint ventures many of these transactions if consummated could be material to its financial condition and results of operations in addition the process of integrating an acquired company business or group of assets may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures although historically linde has been successful with its acquisition strategy and execution the areas where linde may face risks include 

• the need to implement or remediate controls procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to the acquisition lacked these controls procedures and policies 

• diversion of management time and focus from operating existing business to acquisition integration challenges 

• cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into the existing organization 

• the need to integrate each company’s accounting management information human resources and other administrative systems to permit effective management 

• difficulty with the assimilation of acquired operations and products 

• failure to achieve targeted synergies and cost reductions and 

• inability to retain key employees and business relationships of acquired companies 

foreign acquisitions and joint ventures involve unique risks in addition to those mentioned herein including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages currency risks and the particular economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries 

also the anticipated benefit of potential future acquisitions may not materialize future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or impairments of goodwill any of which could adversely impact linde’s financial results 

linde is subject to a variety of international laws and government regulations and changes in or failure to comply with these laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on the company’s business financial position and results of operations 

linde is subject to regulations in the following areas among others 

• environmental protection including climate change and energy efficiency laws and policies 

• us and nonus tax laws and currency controls 

• safety 

• securities laws applicable in the united states the european union germany ireland and other jurisdictions 

• trade and importexport restrictions as well as economic sanctions laws 

• antitrust matters 

• data protection 

• global antibribery laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act and 

• healthcare regulations 

changes in these or other regulatory areas may impact linde’s profitability and may give rise to new or increased compliance risks it may become more complex and costly to ensure compliance and the level of sanctions in the event of noncompliance may rise noncompliance with such laws and regulations could result in penalties or sanctions cancellation of marketing rights or restrictions on participation in or even exclusion from public tender proceedings all of which could have a material adverse impact on linde’s financial results andor reputation 

such changes may also restrict linde’s ability to compete effectively in the marketplace changes to regulations in the areas of environmental protection and climate change for example may impact customer and competitor behavior driving structural changes in key end markets while linde will work to mitigate these risks through the pursuit of strategic alliances and investment in applications technologies to capture new growth areas given the uncertainty about the type and scope of new regulations it is difficult to predict how such changes and their impact on market behavior will ultimately impact linde’s business however such changes could have a material adverse impact on lindes results of operations 

doing business globally requires linde to comply with anticorruption trade compliance and economic sanctions and similar laws and to implement policies and procedures designed to ensure that its employees and other intermediaries comply with the applicable restrictions these restrictions include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products services and any other economic resources to embargoed or sanctioned countries governments persons and entities compliance with these restrictions requires among other things screening of business partners despite its commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics the company cannot ensure that its policies and procedures will always protect it from intentional reckless or negligent acts committed by employees or agents under the applicable laws if linde fails to comply with laws governing the conduct of international operations linde may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures which could materially adversely affect its reputation business and results of operations 

the outcome of litigation or governmental investigations may adversely impact the company’s business or results of operations 

linde’s subsidiaries are party to various lawsuits and governmental investigations arising in the ordinary course of business adverse outcomes in some or all of the claims pending may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect linde’s ability to conduct business linde and its subsidiaries may in the future become subject to further claims and litigation which is impossible to predict the litigation and other claims linde faces are subject to inherent uncertainties legal or regulatory judgments or agreed settlements might give rise to expenses which are not covered or are not fully covered by insurance benefits and may also lead to negative publicity and reputational damage an unfavorable outcome or determination could cause a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations 

potential product defects or inadequate customer care may adversely impact linde’s business or results of operations 

risks associated with products and services may result in potential liability claims the loss of customers or damage to linde’s reputation principal possible causes of risks associated with products and services are product defects or an inadequate level of customer care when linde is providing services 

linde is exposed to legal risks relating to product liability in the countries where it operates including countries such as the united states where legal risks in particular through class actions have historically been more significant than in other countries the outcome of any pending or future products and services proceedings or investigations cannot be predicted and legal or regulatory judgments or agreed settlements may give rise to significant losses costs and expenses 

the manufacturing and sale of products as well as the construction and sale of plants by linde may give rise to risks associated with the production filling storage handling and transport of raw materials goods or waste industrial gases are potentially hazardous substances and medical gases and the related healthcare services must comply with the relevant specifications in order to not adversely affect the health of patients treated with them 

linde’s products and services if defective or not handled or performed appropriately may lead to personal injuries business interruptions environmental damages or other significant damages which may result among other consequences in liability losses monetary penalties or compensation payments environmental cleanup costs or other costs and expenses exclusion from certain market sectors deemed important for future development of the business and loss of reputation all these consequences could have a material adverse effect on linde’s business and results of operations 

us civil liabilities may not be enforceable against linde 

linde is organized under the laws of ireland and substantial portions of its assets are located outside of the united states in addition certain directors and officers of linde and its subsidiaries reside outside the united states as a result it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the united states upon linde or such persons or to enforce outside the united states judgments obtained against such persons in us courts in any action including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws in addition it may be difficult for investors to enforce in 

original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the united states rights predicated upon the us federal securities laws 

a judgment for the payment of money rendered by a court in the united states based on civil liability would not be automatically enforceable in ireland there is no treaty between ireland and the united states providing for the reciprocal enforcement of foreign judgments the following requirements must be met before the foreign judgment will be deemed to be enforceable in ireland i the judgment must be for a definite sum ii the judgment must be final and conclusive and iii the judgment must be provided by a court of competent jurisdiction 

an irish court will also exercise its right to refuse judgment if the foreign judgment i was obtained by fraud ii violated irish public policy iii is in breach of natural justice or iv if the judgment is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment 

in addition there is doubt as to whether an irish court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability on linde or such persons in an original action predicated solely upon the us federal securities laws brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in ireland against linde or such member officer or expert respectively 

changes in tax laws or policy could adversely impact the company’s financial position or results of operations 

linde and its subsidiaries are subject to the tax rules and regulations in the us germany ireland the uk and other countries in which they operate those tax rules and regulations are subject to change on a prospective or retroactive basis under current economic and political conditions tax rates and policies in any jurisdiction including the us the uk and the eu are subject to significant changes which could result in a significant change to lindes current and deferred income tax in particular since linde is currently treated as uk tax resident any potential changes in the tax rules applying to uk taxresident companies would directly affect linde 

a change in linde’s tax residency could have a negative effect on the company’s future profitability and may trigger taxes on dividends or exit charges if linde ceases to be resident in the uk and becomes resident in another jurisdiction it may be subject to uk exit charges andor could become liable for additional tax charges in the other jurisdiction if linde were to be treated as resident in more than one jurisdiction it could be subject to duplicative taxation furthermore although linde is incorporated in ireland and is not expected to be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes it is possible that the irs could challenge this result or that changes in us federal income tax law could alter this result if the irs successfully asserted such a position or the law were to change significant adverse tax consequences may result for linde the company and linde’s shareholders 

changes in tax laws may result in higher tax expense and tax payments in addition changes in tax legislation and uncertainty about the tax environment in some regions may restrict lindes opportunity to enforce its respective rights under the law linde also operates in countries with complex tax regulations which could be interpreted in different ways linde and its subsidiaries are subject to audits by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions or other review actions by the relevant financial or tax authorities the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in linde’s or its subsidiaries’ financial statements and may materially affect their respective financial results for the period when such determination is made

results of operations 

the following table provides a summary of changes in consolidated sales 



2021 compared with 2020 

sales 

linde sales increased 3550 million or 13 for the 2021 year versus 2020 volume growth across all end markets and project start ups increased sales by 8 higher pricing across all geographic segments contributed 3 to sales currency translation increased sales by 2 largely in emea and apac driven by the strengthening of the euro australian dollar chinese yuan and british pound against the us dollar cost passthrough representing the contractual billing of energy cost variances primarily to onsite customers increased sales by 3 with minimal impact on operating profit divestitures decreased sales by 3 primarily driven by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in apac see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization   

cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased 2160 million or 14 for the year primarily due to higher volumes cost passthrough and currency impacts partially offset by productivity initiatives cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization was 570 and 565 of sales respectively in 2021 compared to 2020 the increase as a percentage of sales was due primarily to higher cost passthrough 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expense sga decreased 4 million from 3193 in 2020 to 3189 million in 2021 sga was 104 of sales in 2021 versus 117 in 2020 primarily due to continued productivity initiatives and the impact of higher cost passthrough on sales currency impacts increased sga by approximately 62 million in 2021 excluding currency impacts underlying sga decreased due to continued productivity initiatives 

depreciation and amortization 

reported depreciation and amortization expense increased 9 million versus 2020 the increase is primarily due to currency translation impacts partially offset by a decrease related primarily to intangible assets acquired in the merger becoming fully amortized 

on an adjusted basis depreciation and amortization expense increased 66 million or 2 versus 2020 the increase is primarily due to currency translation impacts which increased depreciation and amortization by approximately 60 million in 2021 excluding currency impacts underlying depreciation was relatively flat as the impact of new project start ups was largely offset by the decrease related to the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in apac see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

cost reduction programs and other charges 

linde recorded cost reduction programs and other charges of 273 million and 506 million for 2021 and 2020 respectively primarily associated with the companys cost reduction program which represents charges for achieving synergies and cost efficiencies related to the merger see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

on an adjusted basis these costs have been excluded in both periods 

operating profit 

reported operating profit increased 1662 million in 2021 or 50 on an adjusted basis operating profit increased 1379 million or 24 for 2021 versus 2020 

on a reported basis operating profit increased 1662 million or 50 in 2021 the increase in the year was driven by higher volumes and price partially offset by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in apac cost reduction programs and other charges were 273 million in 2021 and 506 million in 2020 

on an adjusted basis which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting cost reduction programs and other charges operating profit increased 1379 million or 24 operating profit growth was driven by higher volume and price and the benefit of cost reduction programs and productivity initiatives partially offset by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in apac a discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows 

interest expense  net 

reported interest expense – net in 2021 decreased 38 million or 33 versus 2020  on an adjusted basis interest expense decreased 54 million or 29 in 2021 as compared to 2020 

on both a reported and adjusted basis the decrease year over year was driven by a lower effective borrowing rate and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency revaluation on an unhedged intercompany loan in the prior year 

net pension and opeb cost benefit excluding service cost 

reported net pension and opeb cost benefit excluding service cost was a benefit of 192 million and 177 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase in benefit largely relates to a higher expected return on plan assets and lower interest costs partially offset by higher amortization of deferred losses see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

effective tax rate 

the reported effective tax rate etr for 2021 was 247 versus 250 in 2020 the decrease is primarily driven by increased pretax income and jurisdictional mix 2021 includes a deferred income tax charge related to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities for a tax rate increase in the united kingdom offset by a reduction to tax expense related to uncertain tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties of 47 million see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

on an adjusted basis the etr for 2021 was 241 versus 238 in 2020 the increase in the adjusted etr is primarily due to lower tax benefits in 2021 relative to higher pretax income 

income from equity investments 

reported income from equity investments for 2021 was 119 million as compared to 85 million in 2020 on an adjusted basis income from equity investments for 2021 was 231 million versus 142 million in 2020 

on a reported basis the increase in income from equity investments was primarily driven by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in apac which is reflected in equity income effective january 1 2021 partially offset by a 35 million impairment charge related to a joint venture in the apac segment in the third quarter of 2021 

on an adjusted basis the increase in income from equity investments was primarily driven by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in apac which is reflected in equity income effective january 1 2021 

noncontrolling interests from continuing operations 

at december 31 2021 noncontrolling interests from continuing operations consisted primarily of noncontrolling shareholders’ investments in apac primarily in china and surface technologies 

reported noncontrolling interests from continuing operations increased 10 million from 125 million in 2020 to 135 million in 2021 primarily driven by higher income from continuing operations partially offset by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in apac see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and the buyout of minority shareholders in the republic of south africa 

adjusted noncontrolling interests from continuing operations decreased 36 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily driven by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in apac see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and the buyout of minority shareholders in the republic of south africa which more than offset the increase from higher income from continuing operations 

income from continuing operations 

reported income from continuing operations increased 1324 million or 53 primarily due to higher overall operating profit 

on an adjusted basis which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and other nongaap adjustments income from continuing operations increased 1208 million or 28 in 2021 versus 2020 the increase was primarily due to higher adjusted operating profit 

diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 

reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 262 or 56 in 2021 as compared to 2020 on an adjusted basis diluted eps of 1069 in 2021 increased 30 versus 2020 the increase on both reported and adjusted basis was primarily due to higher income from continuing operations and lower diluted shares outstanding 

employees 

the number of employees at december 31 2021 was 72327 a decrease of 3 or 1880 employees from december 31 2020 primarily driven by cost reduction actions and divestitures 

other financial data 

ebitda increased to 9738 million in 2021 from 8033 million in 2020 adjusted ebitda from continuing operations increased to 10179 million for 2021 as compared to 8645 million in 2020 primarily due to higher income from continuing operations versus the prior year period 

see the nongaap financial measures section for definitions and reconciliations of these nongaap measures to reported gaap amounts 

other comprehensive income loss 

other comprehensive income loss for the year ended december 31 2021 of 358 million resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of 1175 million largely offset by an increase in the funded status of the companys retirement obligations of 746 million driven by a higher discount rate environment and strong asset performance the translation adjustments reflect the impact of translating local currency foreign subsidiary financial statements to us dollars and are largely driven by the movement of the us dollar against major currencies including the euro the chinese yuan and the british pound see the currency section of the mda for exchange rates used for translation purposes and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income by segment 

related party transactions 

the company’s related parties are primarily unconsolidated equity affiliates the company did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated with independent parties 

environmental matters 

linde’s principal operations relate to the production and distribution of atmospheric and other industrial gases which historically have not had a significant impact on the environment however worldwide costs relating to environmental protection may continue to grow due to increasingly stringent laws and regulations and lindes ongoing commitment to rigorous internal standards in addition linde may face physical risks from climate change and extreme weather 

climate change 

linde operates in jurisdictions that have or are developing laws andor regulations to reduce or mitigate the adverse effects of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and faces a highly uncertain regulatory environment in this area for example the us environmental protection agency epa has promulgated rules requiring reporting of ghg emissions and linde and many of its suppliers and customers are subject to these rules epa has also promulgated regulations to restrict ghg emissions including final rules regulating ghg emissions from lightduty vehicles and certain large manufacturing facilities many of which are linde suppliers or customers in addition to these developments in the united states several other countries worldwide have already implemented carbon taxation or trading systems which impact the companys customers and linde operations including regulations in china singapore and the european union among other impacts such regulations are expected to raise the cost of energy which is a significant cost for linde nevertheless lindes longterm customer contracts routinely provide rights to recover increased electricity natural gas and other costs that are incurred by the company as a result of climate change regulation 

linde anticipates continued growth in its hydrogen business due to increased focus on lowering ghg emissions traditionally hydrogen production plants and a large number of other manufacturing and electricitygenerating plants have been identified in california and the european union as a source of carbon dioxide emissions and these plants are subject to capandtrade regulations in those jurisdictions linde believes it will be able to mitigate the costs of these regulations through the terms of its product supply contracts however legislation that limits ghg emissions may impact growth by increasing capital compliance operating and maintenance costs andor decreasing demand 

to manage business risks from current and potential ghg emission regulation as well as physical consequences of climate change linde actively monitors current developments evaluates the direct and indirect business risks and takes appropriate actions among others actions include increasing relevant resources and training maintaining contingency plans obtaining advice and counsel from expert vendors insurance providers and industry experts incorporating ghg provisions in commercial agreements and conducting regular reviews of the business risks with management although there are considerable uncertainties linde believes that the business risk from potential regulations can be effectively managed through its commercial contracts additionally linde does not anticipate any material effects regarding its plant operations or business arising from potential physical risks of climate change 

linde continuously seeks opportunities to optimize energy use and ghg emissions through research and development in customer applications and rigorous operational energy efficiency sourcing renewable energy and purchasing hydrogen as a chemical byproduct where feasible linde tracks ghg emission performance versus targets and reports regularly to business management and annually to lindes board of directors effective november 2021 a new sustainability committee was created the committee is responsible for board oversight of the companys programs policies and strategies related to environmental matters generally including climate change greenhouse gas reduction goals and decarbonization solutions such as clean hydrogen and carbon capture 

at the same time external factors may provide linde with future business opportunities examples of such factors include governmental regulation of ghg and other emissions uncertain costs of energy and certain natural resources the development of renewable energy alternatives and new technologies that help extract natural gas improve air quality increase energy efficiency and mitigate the impacts of climate change linde continues to develop new applications that can lower emissions and help customers lower energy consumption and increase product throughput stricter regulation of water quality in emerging economies such as china provide a growing market for a number of gases eg oxygen for wastewater treatment increased concern about drought in areas such as california and australia may create additional markets for carbon dioxide for desalination renewable fuel standards in the european union and us can create a market for secondgeneration biofuels which use industrial gases such as oxygen carbon dioxide and hydrogen 

costs relating to the protection of the environment 

environmental protection costs in 2021 were not significant linde anticipates that future annual environmental protection expenditures will be similar to 2021 subject to any significant changes in existing laws and regulations based on historical results and current estimates management does not believe that environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position the consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any given year 

legal proceedings 

see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning legal proceedings 

retirement benefits 

pensions 

the net periodic benefit cost benefit for the us and nonus pension plans was a benefit of 35 million and 28 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively and costs of 107 million in 2019 2019 net periodic pension cost included pension settlement charges of 97 million related to lump sum payments which were triggered by either a change in control provision or mergerrelated divestitures and a net curtailment charge of 8 million for termination benefits primarily in connection with a defined benefit pension plan freeze settlement charges were 4 million and 6 million for 2021 and 2020 respectively 

the funded status pension benefit obligation pbo less the fair value of plan assets for the us plans was a deficit of 135 million and 436 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the funded status for nonus plans was a deficit of 1409 million and 2334 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively both the us and nonus 

plans derived the benefit from the actual return on plan assets as well as favorability generated from a lower pbo due to an increase in discount rates 

global pension contributions were 42 million in 2021 91 million in 2020 and 94 million in 2019 at a minimum linde contributes to its pension plans to comply with local regulatory requirements eg erisa in the us discretionary contributions in excess of the local minimum requirements are made based on many factors including longterm projections of the plans funded status the economic environment potential risk of overfunding pension insurance costs and alternative uses of cash changes to these factors can impact the timing of discretionary contributions from year to year estimated required contributions for 2021 are currently expected to be in the range of 40 million to 50 million 

linde assumes expected returns on plan assets for 2022 of 700 and 554 f or the us and nonus plans respectively which are consistent with the longterm expected returns on its investment portfolios 

excluding the impact of any settlements 2022 consolidated pension expense is expected to be a benefit of approximately 91 million  th e benefit derived from the expected return on assets assumption for lindes most significant plans is anticipated to more than offset the expense from service and interest cost accruals and the higher amortization of deferred losses 

refer to the critical accounting policies section and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the company’s retirement benefits including a description of the various retirement plans and the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost benefit and funded status 

insurance 

linde purchases insurance to limit a variety of property and casualty risks including those related to property business interruption thirdparty liability and workers’ compensation currently the company self retains up to 10 million per occurrence for vehicle liability in the united states 5 million per occurrence for workers compensation and general liability in addition the company self retains risk up to €5 million at its various properties worldwide for property damage resulting from fire flood and other perils affecting its properties along with a separate €5 million deductible on all business interruption resulting from a major peril loss to mitigate its aggregate loss potential above these retentions the company purchases catastrophic insurance coverage from highly rated insurance companies the company does not currently operate or participate in any captive insurance companies or other nontraditional risk transfer alternatives 

at december 31 2021 and 2020 the company had recorded a total of 75 million and 71 million respectively representing an estimate of the retained liability for the ultimate cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet dates the estimated liability is established using statistical analysis and is based upon historical experience actuarial assumptions and professional judgment these estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency and are subject to a significant degree of inherent variability if actual claims differ from the company’s estimates they will be adjusted at that time and financial results could be impacted 

linde recognizes estimated insurance proceeds relating to damages at the time of loss only to the extent of incurred losses any insurance recoveries for business interruption and for property damages in excess of the net book value of the property are recognized only when realized or pending payments confirmed by its insurance companies 

segment discussion 

linde’s operations consist of two major product lines industrial gases and engineering as further described in the following paragraph linde’s industrial gases operations are managed on a geographic basis which represents three of the companys reportable segments  americas emea europemiddle eastafrica and apac asiasouth pacific a fourth reportable segment which represents the companys engineering business which designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications specifically for end customers and is managed on a worldwide basis operating in all geographic segments other consists of corporate costs and a few smaller businesses which individually do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation 

the industrial gases product line centers on the manufacturing and distribution of atmospheric gases oxygen nitrogen argon rare gases and process gases carbon dioxide helium hydrogen electronic gases specialty gases acetylene many of these products are coproducts of the same manufacturing process linde manufactures and distributes nearly all of its products and manages its customer relationships on a regional basis linde’s industrial gases are distributed to various endmarkets within a regional segment through one of three basic distribution methods onsite or tonnage merchant or bulk and packaged or cylinder gases the distribution methods are generally integrated in order to best meet the customer’s needs and very few of its products can be economically transported outside of a region therefore the distribution economics are specific to the various geographies in which the company operates and are consistent with how management assesses performance 

the company’s measure of profitloss for segment reporting purposes is segment operating profit segment operating profit is defined as operating profit excluding purchase accounting impacts of the linde ag merger intercompany royalties and items not indicative of ongoing business trends this is the manner in which the company’s chief operating decision maker codm assesses performance and allocates resources

to help understand the reported results the following is a summary of the significant currencies underlying linde’s consolidated results and the exchange rates used to translate the financial statements rates of exchange expressed in units of local currency per us dollar   



liquidity capital resources and other financial data   



 

a see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

cash decreased 931 million in 2021 versus 2020 the primary sources of cash in 2021 were cash flows from operations of 9725 million the primary uses of cash included capital expenditures of 3086 million net purchases of ordinary shares of 4562 million and cash dividends to shareholders of 2189 million 

cash flows from operations   

2021 compared with 2020 

cash flows from operations was 9725 million an increase of 2296 million or 31 from 2020 the increase was driven by higher net income adjusted for noncash charges and lower working capital requirements including an increase in contract liabilities due to engineering customer advanced payments which more than offset higher cash taxes cost reduction programs and other charges net of payments was 98 million and 258 million for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively representing charges of 273 million and 506 million net of related cash outflows of 175 million and 248 million respectively in each period 

investing 

2021 compared with 2020 

net cash used for investing activities was 3007 million in 2021 compared to 2986 million in 2020 the increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021 largely offset by lower capital expenditures 

capital expenditures in 2021 were 3086 million a decrease of 314 million from 2020 capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth approximately 42 of the capital expenditures were in the americas segment with 32 in the apac segment and the rest primarily in the emea segment 

at december 31 2021  lindes sale of gas backlog of large projects under construction was approximately 35 billion this represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction 

acquisition expenditures in 2021 were 88 million an increase of 20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the americas and emea acquisitions for the year ended december 31 2020 were 68 million and related to acquisitions in the americas and apac 

divestitures and asset sales in 2021 totaled 167 million as compared to 482 million in 2020 the 2020 period includes net proceeds from mergerrelated divestitures of 98 million from the sale of selected assets of linde china and proceeds of approximately 130 million related to the divestiture of a noncore business in scandinavia 

financing 

linde’s financing strategy is to secure longterm committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a longterm bank credit agreement linde’s international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and intercompany funding to minimize the total cost of funds and to manage and centralize currency exchange exposures as deemed necessary linde manages its exposure to interestrate changes through the use of financial derivatives see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

cash used for financing activities was 7588 million in 2021 compared to 3345 million in 2020 cash used for debt was 514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of 1313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings partially offset by lower debt repayments net purchases of ordinary shares were 4562 million in 2021 versus 2410 million in 2020 cash dividends increased to 2189 million in 2021 versus 2028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10 increase in dividends per share from 3852 per share to 424 per share cash used for noncontrolling interest transactions and other was 323 million for the year ended december 31 2021 versus cash used of 220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the republic of south africa in january of 2021 

the company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility cash reserves and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world at december 31 2021 lindes credit ratings as reported by standard  poor’s and moody’s were a1 and p1 for shortterm debt respectively and a and a2 for longterm debt respectively 

note 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company’s debt activity in 2021 current debt position debt covenants and the available credit facilities and note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments lindes credit facilities are with major financial institutions and are noncancelable until maturity therefore the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities if requested to be low linde’s major bank credit and longterm debt agreements contain standard covenants the company was in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future 

the company maintains a 5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants no borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of december 31 2021 the company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets andor other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from moody’s and standard  poor’s 

linde’s total net debt outstanding at december 31 2021 was 11384 million 1016 million lower than 12400 million at december 31 2020 the december 31 2021 net debt balance includes 13069 million in public securities 1138 million representing primarily worldwide bank borrowings net of 2823 million of cash linde’s global effective borrowing rate was approximately 14 for 2021 

in june 2021 linde repaid €600 million of 3875 notes that became due in september 2021 linde issued €700 million of 0000 notes due 2026 €500 million of 0375 notes due 2033 and €700 million of 1000 notes due 2051 in november 2021 linde repaid 600 million of 245 notes that were due in 2022 there was no impact to interest within the consolidated statements of income see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

in january 2022 linde repaid €10 billion of 0250 notes that became due in 2022 

on february 28 2022 the company’s board of directors approved the additional repurchase of 100 billion of its ordinary shares for additional information related to the share repurchase programs see part ii item 5 market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2021 linde had undrawn outstanding letters of credit bank guarantees and surety bonds entered into in connection with normal business operations and they are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on linde’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

critical accounting estimates 

the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding linde’s financial statements and accompanying notes prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap their application places significant importance on management’s judgment as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain linde’s financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected if actual results differ from estimates made these policies are determined by management and have been reviewed by linde’s audit committee 

revenue recognition 

longterm construction contracts 

the company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other varied gas production and processing plants manufactured specifically for end customers revenues for sale of equipment contracts are generally recognized over time as linde has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance does not create an asset with alternative use for contracts recognized over time revenue is recognized primarily using a cost incurred input method costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations the result is applied to total expected revenue and results in financial statement recognition of revenue in addition to costs incurred to date any expected loss on a contract is recognized as an expense immediately contract modifications are typically accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inceptiontodate effect of such change we assess performance as progress towards completion is achieved on specific projects earnings will be impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects 

the cost incurred input method places considerable importance on accurate estimates of the extent of progress towards completion and may involve estimates on the scope of deliveries and services required to fulfill the contractually defined obligations the key source of estimation uncertainty is the total estimated costs at completion including material labor and overhead costs and the resultant state of completion of the contracts there are inherent uncertainties associated with the estimation process including technical complexity duration of construction cycle potential cost inflation whether equipment or manpower and scope considerations all of which may affect the total estimation process changes in these estimates may lead to a significant impact on future financial statements 

pension benefits 

pension benefits represent financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments significant estimates are required to calculate pension expense and liabilities related to the company’s plans the company utilizes the services of independent actuaries whose models are used to facilitate these calculations 

several key assumptions are used in actuarial models to calculate pension expense and liability amounts recorded in the financial statements management believes the three most significant variables in the models are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate and the expected rate of compensation increase the actuarial models also use assumptions for various other factors including longterm inflation rates employee turnover retirement age and 

mortality linde management believes the assumptions used in the actuarial calculations are reasonable reflect the company’s experience and expectations for the future and are within accepted practices in each of the respective geographic locations in which it operates actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors the sensitivities to each of the key assumptions presented below exclude the impact of special items that occurred during the year 

the weightedaverage expected longterm rates of return on pension plan assets were 700 for us plans and 528 for nonus plans for the year ended december 31 2021 700 and 531 respectively at december 31 2020 the expected longterm rate of return on the us and nonus plan assets is estimated based on the plans investment strategy and asset allocation historical capita l market performance and to a lesser extent historical plan performance a 050 change in these expected longterm rates of return with all other variables held constant would change linde’s pension expense by approximately 46 million 

the company has consistently used a marketrelated value of assets rather than the fair value at the measurement date to determine annual pension expense the marketrelated value recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period as a result changes in the fair value of assets from year to year are not immediately reflected in the company’s annual pension expense instead annual pension expense in future periods will be impacted as deferred investment gains or losses are r ecognized in the marketrelated value of assets over the fiveyear period the consolidated marketrelated value of assets was 9612 million or 804 million lower than the fair value of assets of 10416 million at december 31 2021 these net deferred investment losses of 804 million wil l be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of assets ratably over the next four years and will impact future pension expense future actual investment gains or losses will impact the marketrelated value of assets and therefore will impact future annual pension expense in a similar manner 

discount rates are used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities and pension costs and are determined annually by management the company measures the service and interest cost components of pension and opeb expense for significant us and nonus plans using the spot rate approach us plans that do not use the spot rate approach continue to determine discount rates by using a cash flow matching model provided by the companys independent actuaries the model includes a portfolio of corporate bonds graded aa or better by at least half of the ratings agencies and matches the us plans projected cash flows to the calculated spot rates discount rates for the remaining nonus plans are based on market yields for highquality fixed income investments representing the approximate duration of the pension liabilities on the measurement date refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial stat ements for a summary of the discount rates used to calculate plan liabilities and benefit costs and to the retirement benefits section of the consolidated results and other information section of this mda for a further discussion of 2021 benefit costs a 050 reduction in discount rates with all other variables held constant would increase linde’s pension expense by approximately 52 million whereas a 050 increase in discount rates would result in a decrease of 47 million a 050 reduction in discount rates would increase the pbo by approximately 951 million whereas a 050 increase in discount rates would have a favorable impact to the pbo of approximately 841 million 

the weightedaverage expected rate of compensation increase was 325 for us plans and 255 for nonus plans at december 31 2021 325 and 255 respectively at december 31 2020 the estimated annual compensation increase is determined by management every year and is based on historical trends and market indices a 050 change in the expected rate of compensation increase with all other variables held constant would change linde’s pension expense by approximately 8 million and would impact the pbo by approximately 54 million 

asset impairments 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles assets 

at december 31 2021 the company had goodwill of 27038 million and 1813 million of other indefinitelived intangible assets goodwill represents the aggregate of the excess consideration paid for acquired businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired indefinitelived other intangibles relate to the linde name 

the company performs a goodwill impairment test annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred 

the impairment tests performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 indicated no impairment at december 31 2021 linde’s enterprise value was approximately 188 billion outstanding shares multiplied by the yearend stock price plus net debt and without any control premium while its total capital was approximately 57 billion 

the impairment test allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value then the company will estimate and compare the fair value of its reporting units to 

their carrying value including goodwill reporting units are determined based on one level below the operating segment level 

management believes that the quantitative and qualitative factors used to perform its annual goodwill impairment assessment are appropriate and reasonable although the 2021 assessment indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value changes in circumstances or conditions affecting this analysis could have a significant impact on the fair value determination which could then result in a material impairment charge to the companys results of operations reporting units with greater concentration of linde ag assets fair valued during the 2018 praxair inc and linde ag merger are at greater risk of impairment in future periods 

other indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred and no impairments were indicated 

see notes 9 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

longlived assets 

longlived assets including property plant and equipment and finitelived other intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an individual asset or asset group may not be recoverable for purposes of this test asset groups are determined based upon the lowest level for which there are independent and identifiable cash flows based upon lindes business model an asset group may be a single plant and related assets used to support onsite merchant and packaged gas customers alternatively the asset group may be a collection of distribution related assets cylinders distribution centers and stores or be a pipeline complex which includes multiple interdependent plants and related assets connected by pipelines within a geographic area used to support the same distribution methods 

income taxes 

at december 31 2021 linde had deferred tax assets of 1829 million net of valuation allowances of 235 million and deferred tax liabilities of 7826 million at december 31 2021 uncertain tax positions totaled 387 million see note 1 and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements income tax expense was 1262 million for the year ended december 31 2021 or about 247 of pretax income see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to taxes 

in the preparation of consolidated financial statements linde estimates income taxes based on diverse legislative and regulatory structures that exist in various jurisdictions where the company conducts business deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent tax benefits or obligations that arise from temporary differences due to differing treatment of certain items for accounting and income tax purposes linde evaluates deferred tax assets each period to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character eg capital gain versus ordinary income treatment amount and timing to result in their recovery a valuation allowance is established when management determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized to reduce the assets to their realizable value considerable judgments are required in establishing deferred tax valuation allowances and in assessing exposures related to tax matters as events and circumstances change related reserves and valuation allowances are adjusted to income at that time linde’s tax returns are subject to audit and local taxing authorities could challenge the company’s tax positions the company’s practice is to review tax filing positions by jurisdiction and to record provisions for uncertain income tax positions including interest and penalties when applicable linde believes it records andor discloses such potential tax liabilities as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its income tax liabilities and recoverable tax assets if new information becomes available adjustments are charged or credited against income at that time management does not anticipate that such adjustments would have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s reported results of operations 

contingencies 

the company accrues liabilities for nonincome tax contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated while contingent gains are recognized only when realized or realizable if new information becomes available or losses are sustained in excess of recorded amounts adjustments are charged against income at that time management does not anticipate that in the aggregate such losses would have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s reported results of operations 

linde is subject to various claims legal proceedings and government investigations that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business these actions are based upon alleged environmental tax antitrust and personal injury claims among others see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements such contingencies are significant and the accounting requires considerable management judgments in analyzing each matter to assess the likely outcome and the need for establishing appropriate liabilities and providing adequate disclosures linde believes it records andor discloses such contingencies as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its liabilities 

new accounting standards 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning new accounting standards and the impact of the implementation of these standards on the company’s financial statements 

fair value measurements 

linde does not expect changes in the aggregate fair value of its financial assets and liabilities to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

linde is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates the objective of financial risk management at linde is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company’s earnings cash flows and equity 

to manage these risks linde uses various derivative financial instruments including interestrate swaps treasury rate locks currency swaps forward contracts and commodity contracts linde only uses commonly traded and nonleveraged instruments these contracts are entered into primarily with major banking institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss also see note 1 and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of linde’s accounting policies and use of such instruments 

the following discussion presents the sensitivity of the market value earnings and cash flows of linde’s financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest and exchange rates assuming these changes occurred at december 31 2021 the range of changes chosen for these discussions reflects linde’s view of changes which are reasonably possible over a oneyear period market values represent the present values of projected future cash flows based on interest rate and exchange rate assumptions 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2021 linde had debt totaling 14207 million 16154 million at december 31 2020 for fixedrate instruments interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows conversely for floatingrate instruments interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of the instrument but impact future earnings and cash flows assuming that other factors are held constant at december 31 2021 including the impact of derivatives linde had fixedrate debt of 12492 million and floatingrate debt of 1715 million representing 88 and 12 respectively of total debt at december 31 2020 linde had fixedrate debt of 10365 million and floatingrate debt of 5789 million representing 64 and 36 respectively of total debt 

fixed rate debt 

in order to mitigate interest rate risk when considered appropriate interestrate swaps are entered into as hedges of underlying financial instruments to effectively change the characteristics of the interest rate without actually changing the underlying financial instrument at december 31 2021 linde had fixedtofloating interest rate swaps outstanding that were designated as hedging instruments of the underlying debt issuances  refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information this sensitivity analysis assumes that holding all other variables constant such as foreign exchange rates swaps and debt levels a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the unrealized fair market value of the fixedrate debt portfolio by approximately 834 million 674 million in 2020 a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate 37 million decrease to derivative assets recorded 

variable rate debt 

at december 31 2021 the aftertax earnings and cash flows impact of a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates including offsetting impact of derivatives on the variablerate debt portfolio would be approximately 33 million 44 million in 2020 

foreign currency risk 

linde’s exchangerate exposures result primarily from its investments and ongoing operations in latin america primarily brazil and mexico europe primarily germany scandinavia and the uk canada asia pacific primarily australia and china and other business transactions such as the procurement of equipment from foreign sources linde frequently utilizes currency contracts to hedge these exposures at december 31 2021 linde had a notional amount outstanding of 5870 million 7553 million at december 31 2020 related to foreign exchange contracts the majority of these were to hedge recorded balance sheet exposures primarily intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

holding all other variables constant if there were a 10 increase in foreigncurrency exchange rates for the portfolio the fair market value of foreigncurrency contracts outstanding at december 31 2021 would decrease by approximately 28 million and at december 31 2020 would decrease by approximately 99 million which would be largely offset by an offsetting loss or gain on the foreigncurrency fluctuation of the underlying exposure being hedged

 item 1 business 

general 

linde plc is a public limited company formed under the laws of ireland with its principal offices in the united kingdom linde is the largest industrial gas company worldwide and is a major technological innovator in the industrial gases industry its primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases oxygen nitrogen argon and rare gases and process gases carbon dioxide helium hydrogen electronic gases specialty gases and acetylene the company also designs and builds equipment that produces industrial gases and offers customers a wide range of gas production and processing services such as olefin plants natural gas plants air separation plants hydrogen and synthesis gas plants and other types of plants 

linde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare petroleum refining manufacturing food beverage carbonation fiberoptics steel making aerospace chemicals electronics and water treatment 

linde’s sales were 27243 million 28228 million and 14836 million for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis for a discussion of consolidated sales and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to linde’s reportable segments 

industrial gases products and manufacturing processes 

atmospheric gases are the highest volume products produced by linde using air as its raw material linde produces oxygen nitrogen and argon through several air separation processes of which cryogenic air separation is the most prevalent rare gases such as krypton neon and xenon are also produced through cryogenic air separation as a pioneer in the industrial gases industry linde is a leader in developing a wide range of proprietary and patented applications and supply systems technology linde also led the development and commercialization of noncryogenic air separation technologies for the production of industrial gases these technologies open important new markets and optimize production capacity for the company by lowering the cost of supplying industrial gases these technologies include proprietary vacuum pressure swing adsorption “vpsa” and membrane separation to produce gaseous oxygen and nitrogen respectively 

process gases including carbon dioxide hydrogen carbon monoxide helium specialty gases and acetylene are produced by methods other than air separation most carbon dioxide is purchased from byproduct sources including chemical plants refineries and industrial processes or is recovered from carbon dioxide wells carbon dioxide is processed in linde’s plants to produce commercial and foodgrade carbon dioxide hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be produced by either steam methane reforming or autothermal reforming of natural gas or other feed streams such as naphtha hydrogen is also produced by purifying byproduct sources obtained from the chemical and petrochemical industries acetylene is primarily sourced as a chemical byproduct but may also be produced from calcium carbide and water 

industrial gases distribution 

there are three basic distribution methods for industrial gases i onsite or tonnage ii merchant or bulk liquid and iii packaged or cylinder gases these distribution methods are often integrated with products from all three supply modes coming from the same plant the method of supply is generally determined by the lowest cost means of meeting the customer’s needs depending upon factors such as volume requirements purity pattern of usage and the form in which the product is used as a gas or as a cryogenic liquid 

onsite customers that require the largest volumes of product typically oxygen nitrogen and hydrogen and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas onsite plants linde constructs plants on or adjacent to these customers’ sites and supplies the product directly to customers by pipeline onsite product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 1020 years and containing minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions many of the cryogenic onsite plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market therefore plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer advanced air separation processes allow onsite delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements 

merchant the merchant business is generally associated with distributable liquid oxygen nitrogen argon carbon dioxide hydrogen and helium the deliveries generally are made from linde’s plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customers site which are owned and maintained by linde and leased to the customer due to distribution cost merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced merchant argon hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances the customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three to sevenyear requirement contracts 

packaged gases customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in metal containers called cylinders under medium to high pressure packaged gases include atmospheric gases carbon dioxide hydrogen helium acetylene and related products linde also produces and distributes in cylinders a wide range of specialty gases and mixtures cylinders may be delivered to the customer’s site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store packaged gases are generally sold under one to threeyear supply contracts and through purchase orders 

a substantial amount of the cylinder gases sold in the united states are distributed by independent distributors that buy merchant gases in liquid form and repackage the products in their facilities packaged gas distributors including linde also distribute hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers over time linde has acquired a number of independent industrial gases and welding products distributors at various locations in the united states and continues to sell merchant gases to other independent distributors between its own distribution business joint ventures and sales to independent distributors linde is represented in 48 states the district of columbia and puerto rico 

engineering 

linde’s engineering business has a global presence with its focus on market segments such as olefin natural gas air separation hydrogen and synthesis gas plants the company utilizes its extensive process engineering knowhow in the planning design and construction of highly efficient turnkey plants for the production and processing of gases with its stateoftheart sustainable technologies engineering helps customers avoid capture and utilize co2 emissions its technology portfolio covers the entire value chain for production liquefaction storage distribution and application of hydrogen which supports the transition to clean energy its digital services and solutions increase plant efficiency and performance 

lindes plants are used in a wide variety of fields in the petrochemical and chemical industries in refineries and fertilizer plants to recover air gases to produce synthesis gases to treat natural gas and to produce noble gasesthe engineering business either supplies plant components directly to the customer or to the industrial gas business of linde which operates the plants under a longterm gases supply contract 

inventories – linde carries inventories of merchant and cylinder gases hardgoods and coatings materials to supply products to its customers on a reasonable delivery schedule onsite plants and pipeline complexes have limited inventory inventory obsolescence is not material to linde’s business 

customers – linde is not dependent upon a single customer or a few customers 

international – linde is a global enterprise with approximately 69 of its 2020 sales outside of the united states the company also has majority or wholly owned subsidiaries that operate in approximately 45 european middle eastern and african countries including germany france sweden the republic of south africa and the united kingdom uk approximately 20 asian and south pacific countries including china australia india south korea and taiwan and approximately 20 countries in north and south america including canada mexico and brazil 

the company also has equity method investments operating in europe asia africa the middle east and north america 

linde’s international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates import and export controls and other economic political and regulatory policies of local governments also see item 1a “risk factors” and item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

seasonality – linde’s business is generally not subject to seasonal fluctuations to any significant extent 

research and development – linde’s research and development is directed toward development of gas processing separation and liquefaction technologies improving distribution of industrial gases and the development of new markets and applications for these gases this results in the development of new advanced air separation hydrogen synthesis gas natural gas adsorption and chemical process technologies as well as the frequent introduction of new industrial gas applications research and development is primarily conducted at munich germany tonawanda new york burr ridge illinois and shanghai china 

patents and trademarks – linde owns or licenses a large number of patents that relate to a wide variety of products and processes linde’s patents expire at various times over the next 20 years while these patents and licenses are considered important to its individual businesses linde does not consider its business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any one particular patent or patent license or family of patents linde also owns a large number of trademarks of which the linde trademark is the most significant 

raw materials and energy costs – energy is the single largest cost item in the production and distribution of industrial gases most of linde’s energy requirements are in the form of electricity natural gas and diesel fuel for distribution the company mitigates electricity natural gas and hydrocarbon price fluctuations contractually through pricing formulas surcharges and cost pass–through and tolling arrangements 

the supply of energy has not been a significant issue in the geographic areas where the company conducts business however energy availability and price is unpredictable and may pose unforeseen future risks 

for carbon dioxide carbon monoxide helium hydrogen specialty gases and surface technologies raw materials are largely purchased from outside sources linde has contracts or commitments for or readily available sources of most of these raw materials however their longterm availability and prices are subject to market conditions 

competition – linde participates in highly competitive markets in the industrial gases engineering and healthcare businesses which are characterized by a mixture of local regional and global players all of which exert competitive pressure on the parties in locations where linde has pipeline networks which enable the company to provide reliable and economic supply of products to larger customers linde derives a competitive advantage 

competitors in the industrial and medical gases industry include global and regional companies such as l’air liquide sa air products and chemicals inc messer group gmbh mitsubishi chemical holdings corporation through taiyo nippon sanso corporation as well as an extensive number of small to medium size independent industrial gas companies which compete locally as producers or distributors in addition a significant portion of the international gases market relates to customerowned plants 

employees and labor relations – the company sources talent from an everchanging and competitive environment the ability to source and retain qualified and committed employees is a prerequisite for the company’s success and represents a general risk for linde 

the board of directors board has established a strategic business objective to maintain worldclass standards in talent management executive variable compensation is assessed annually based on performance in several strategic nonfinancial areas including talent management the compensation committee assists the board in its oversight of linde’s compensation and incentive policies and programs and management development and succession particularly in regard to reviewing executive compensation for linde’s executive officers the compensation committee also periodically reviews the company’s diversity policies and objectives and programs to achieve those objectives the global head of human resources reports to the chief executive officer ceo a global leader of diversity and inclusion reports to the head of human resources

 item 1a risk factors 

due to the size and geographic reach of the company’s operations a wide range of factors many of which are outside of the company’s control could materially affect the company’s future operations and financial performance management believes the following risks may significantly impact the company 

the recent novel coronavirus covid19 outbreak could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

the novel strain of the coronavirus identified in china in late 2019 has globally spread and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and shutdowns these measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations the operations of our customers vendors and suppliers there is considerable uncertainty regarding such measures and potential future measures and restrictions on our access to our manufacturing facilities or on our support operations or workforce or similar limitations for our vendors and suppliers and restrictions or disruptions of transportation such as reduced availability of air transport port closures and increased border controls or closures could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations these restrictions and disruptions could affect our performance on our contracts 

furthermore covid19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries including negatively impacting economic growth the proper functioning of financial and capital markets foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates risks related to economic conditions are described in our principal risks and uncertainties titled “weakening economic conditions in markets in which linde does business may adversely impact its financial results andor cash flows” and “macroeconomic factors may impact linde’s ability to obtain financing or increase the cost of obtaining financing which may adversely impact linde’s financial results andor cash flows 

weakening economic conditions in markets in which linde does business may adversely impact its financial results andor cash flows 

linde serves a diverse group of industries across more than 100 countries which generally leads to financial stability through various business cycles however a broad decline in general economic or business conditions in the industries served by its customers could adversely affect the demand for linde’s products and impair the ability of its customers to satisfy their obligations to linde resulting in uncollected receivables andor unanticipated contract terminations or project delays for example global political and economic uncertainty could reduce investment activities of linde’s customers which could adversely affect linde’s business 

in addition many of linde’s customers are in businesses that are cyclical in nature such as the chemicals metals and energy industries downturns in these industries may adversely impact linde during these cycles additionally such conditions could impact the utilization of linde’s manufacturing capacity which may require it to recognize impairment losses on tangible assets such as property plant and equipment as well as intangible assets such as goodwill customer relationships or intellectual property 

increases in the cost of energy and raw materials andor disruption in the supply of these materials could result in lost sales or reduced profitability 

energy is the single largest cost item in the production and distribution of industrial gases most of linde’s energy requirements are in the form of electricity natural gas and diesel fuel for distribution linde attempts to minimize the financial impact of variability in these costs through the management of customer contracts and reducing demand through operational productivity and energy efficiency large customer contracts typically have escalation and passthrough clauses to recover energy and feedstock costs such attempts may not successfully mitigate cost variability which could negatively impact linde’s financial condition or results of operations the supply of energy has not been a significant issue in the geographic areas where linde conducts business however regional energy conditions are unpredictable and may pose future risk 

for carbon dioxide carbon monoxide helium hydrogen specialty gases and surface technologies raw materials are largely purchased from outside sources where feasible linde sources several of these raw materials including carbon dioxide hydrogen and calcium carbide as chemical or industrial byproducts in addition linde has contracts or 

commitments for or readily available sources of most of these raw materials however their longterm availability and prices are subject to market conditions a disruption in supply of such raw materials could impact linde’s ability to meet contractual supply commitments 

linde’s international operations are subject to the risks of doing business abroad and international events and circumstances may adversely impact its business financial condition or results of operations 

linde has substantial international operations which are subject to risks including devaluations in currency exchange rates transportation delays and interruptions political and economic instability and disruptions restrictions on the transfer of funds trade conflicts and the imposition of duties and tariffs import and export controls changes in governmental policies labor unrest possible nationalization andor expropriation of assets changes in us and nonus tax policies and compliance with governmental regulations these events could have an adverse effect on the international operations of linde in the future by reducing the demand for its products decreasing the prices at which it can sell its products reducing the revenue from international operations or otherwise having an adverse effect on its business 

currency exchange rate fluctuations and other related risks may adversely affect lindes results 

because a significant portion of lindes revenue is denominated in currencies other than its reporting currency the us dollar changes in exchange rates will produce fluctuations in revenue costs and earnings and may also affect the book value of assets and liabilities and related equity although the company from time to time utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these exposures its efforts to minimize currency exposure through such hedging transactions may not be successful depending on market and business conditions as a result fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect linde’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

macroeconomic factors may impact linde’s ability to obtain financing or increase the cost of obtaining financing which may adversely impact linde’s financial results andor cash flows 

volatility and disruption in the us european and global credit and equity markets from time to time could make it more difficult for linde to obtain financing for its operations andor could increase the cost of obtaining financing in addition linde’s borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on its performance as measured by certain criteria such as interest coverage and leverage ratios a decrease in these debt ratings could increase the cost of borrowing or make it more difficult to obtain financing 

an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets could negatively impact the companys financial results 

as of december 31 2020 the net carrying value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets was 28 billion and 2 billion respectively primarily as a result of the business combination and the related acquisition method of accounting applied to linde ag in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the company periodically assesses these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and sustained market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairments to goodwill or other indefinitelived assets any charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse impact on lindes results of operations in the periods recognized 

catastrophic events could disrupt the operations of linde andor its customers and suppliers and may have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations 

the occurrence of catastrophic events or natural disasters such as extreme weather including hurricanes and floods health epidemics and acts of war or terrorism could disrupt or delay linde’s ability to produce and distribute its products to customers and could potentially expose linde to thirdparty liability claims in addition such events could impact linde’s customers and suppliers resulting in temporary or longterm outages andor the limitation of supply of energy and other raw materials used in normal business operations linde evaluates the direct and indirect business risks consults with vendors insurance providers and industry experts makes investments in suitably resilient design and technology and conducts regular reviews of the business risks with management despite these steps however these situations are outside linde’s control and may have a significant adverse impact on its financial results 

the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel may adversely impact linde’s business 

if linde fails to attract hire and retain qualified personnel it may not be able to develop market or sell its products or successfully manage its business linde is dependent upon a highly skilled experienced and efficient workforce to be successful much of linde’s competitive advantage is based on the expertise and experience of key personnel regarding marketing technology manufacturing and distribution infrastructure systems and products the inability to attract and hire qualified individuals or the loss of key employees in very skilled areas could have a negative effect on linde’s financial results 

if linde fails to keep pace with technological advances in the industry or if new technology initiatives do not become commercially accepted customers may not continue to buy linde’s products and results of operations could be adversely affected 

linde’s research and development is directed toward developing new and improved methods for the production and distribution of industrial gases the design and construction of plants and toward developing new markets and applications for the use of industrial and process gases this results in the introduction of new applications and the development of new advanced process technologies as a result of these efforts linde develops new and proprietary technologies and employs necessary measures to protect such technologies within the global geographies in which linde operates these technologies help linde to create a competitive advantage and to provide a platform to grow its business if linde’s research and development activities do not keep pace with competitors or if linde does not create new technologies that benefit customers future results of operations could be adversely affected 

risks related to pension benefit plans may adversely impact linde’s results of operations and cash flows 

pension benefits represent significant financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments and asset returns significant estimates are required to calculate pension expense and liabilities related to linde’s plans linde utilizes the services of independent actuaries whose models are used to facilitate these calculations several key assumptions are used in the actuarial models to calculate pension expense and liability amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements in particular significant changes in actual investment returns on pension assets discount rates or legislative or regulatory changes could impact future results of operations and required pension contributions 

operational risks may adversely impact linde’s business or results of operations 

linde’s operating results are dependent on the continued operation of its production facilities and its ability to meet customer contract requirements and other needs insufficient or excess capacity threatens linde’s ability to generate competitive profit margins and may expose linde to liabilities related to contract commitments operating results are also dependent on linde’s ability to complete new construction projects on time on budget and in accordance with performance requirements failure to do so may expose linde’s business to loss of revenue potential litigation and loss of business reputation 

also inherent in the management of linde’s production facilities and delivery systems including storage vehicle transportation and pipelines are operational risks that require continuous training oversight and control material operating failures at production storage facilities or pipelines including fire toxic release and explosions or the occurrence of vehicle transportation accidents could result in loss of life damage to the environment loss of production andor extensive property damage all of which may negatively impact linde’s financial results 

linde may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions and breaches in data security 

linde relies on information technology systems and networks for business and operational activities and also stores and processes sensitive business and proprietary information in these systems and networks these systems are susceptible to outages due to fire flood power loss telecommunications failures viruses breakins and similar events or breaches of security 

linde has taken steps to address these risks and concerns by implementing advanced security technologies internal controls network and data center resiliency and recovery process despite these steps however operational failures and breaches of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to the loss or disclosure of confidential 

information result in business interruption or malfunction or regulatory actions and have a material adverse impact on linde’s operations reputation and financial results 

the inability to effectively integrate acquisitions or collaborate with joint venture partners could adversely impact linde’s financial position and results of operations 

linde has evaluated and expects to continue to evaluate a wide array of potential strategic acquisitions and joint ventures many of these transactions if consummated could be material to its financial condition and results of operations in addition the process of integrating an acquired company business or group of assets may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures although historically linde has been successful with its acquisition strategy and execution the areas where linde may face risks include 

• the need to implement or remediate controls procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to the acquisition lacked these controls procedures and policies 

• diversion of management time and focus from operating existing business to acquisition integration challenges 

• cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into the existing organization 

• the need to integrate each company’s accounting management information human resources and other administrative systems to permit effective management 

• difficulty with the assimilation of acquired operations and products 

• failure to achieve targeted synergies and cost reductions and 

• inability to retain key employees and business relationships of acquired companies 

foreign acquisitions and joint ventures involve unique risks in addition to those mentioned herein including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages currency risks and the particular economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries 

also the anticipated benefit of potential future acquisitions may not materialize future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or impairments of goodwill any of which could adversely impact linde’s financial results 

linde is subject to a variety of international laws and government regulations and changes in or failure to comply with these laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on the company’s business financial position and results of operations 

linde is subject to regulations in the following areas among others 

• environmental protection including climate change and energy efficiency laws and policies 

• us and nonus tax laws and currency controls 

• safety 

• securities laws applicable in the united states the european union germany ireland and other jurisdictions 

• trade and importexport restrictions as well as economic sanctions laws 

• antitrust matters 

• data protection 

• global antibribery laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act and 

• healthcare regulations 

changes in these or other regulatory areas may impact linde’s profitability and may give rise to new or increased compliance risks it may become more complex and costly to ensure compliance and the level of sanctions in the event of noncompliance may rise noncompliance with such laws and regulations could result in penalties or sanctions cancellation of marketing rights or restrictions on participation in or even exclusion from public tender proceedings all of which could have a material adverse impact on linde’s financial results andor reputation 

such changes may also restrict linde’s ability to compete effectively in the marketplace changes to regulations in the areas of environmental protection and climate change for example may impact customer and competitor behavior driving structural changes in key end markets while linde will work to mitigate these risks through the pursuit of strategic 

alliances and investment in applications technologies to capture new growth areas given the uncertainty about the type and scope of new regulations it is difficult to predict how such changes and their impact on market behavior will ultimately impact linde’s business however such changes could have a material adverse impact on lindes results of operations 

doing business globally requires linde to comply with anticorruption trade compliance and economic sanctions and similar laws and to implement policies and procedures designed to ensure that its employees and other intermediaries comply with the applicable restrictions these restrictions include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products services and any other economic resources to embargoed or sanctioned countries governments persons and entities compliance with these restrictions requires among other things screening of business partners despite its commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics the company cannot ensure that its policies and procedures will always protect it from intentional reckless or negligent acts committed by employees or agents under the applicable laws if linde fails to comply with laws governing the conduct of international operations linde may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures which could materially adversely affect its reputation business and results of operations 

the outcome of litigation or governmental investigations may adversely impact the company’s business or results of operations 

linde’s subsidiaries are party to various lawsuits and governmental investigations arising in the ordinary course of business adverse outcomes in some or all of the claims pending may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect linde’s ability to conduct business linde and its subsidiaries may in the future become subject to further claims and litigation which is impossible to predict the litigation and other claims linde faces are subject to inherent uncertainties legal or regulatory judgments or agreed settlements might give rise to expenses which are not covered or are not fully covered by insurance benefits and may also lead to negative publicity and reputational damage an unfavorable outcome or determination could cause a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations 

potential product defects or inadequate customer care may adversely impact linde’s business or results of operations 

risks associated with products and services may result in potential liability claims the loss of customers or damage to linde’s reputation principal possible causes of risks associated with products and services are product defects or an inadequate level of customer care when linde is providing services 

linde is exposed to legal risks relating to product liability in the countries where it operates including countries such as the united states where legal risks in particular through class actions have historically been more significant than in other countries the outcome of any pending or future products and services proceedings or investigations cannot be predicted and legal or regulatory judgments or agreed settlements may give rise to significant losses costs and expenses 

the manufacturing and sale of products as well as the construction of plants by linde may give rise to risks associated with the production filling storage handling and transport of raw materials goods or waste industrial gases are potentially hazardous substances and medical gases and the related healthcare services must comply with the relevant specifications in order to not adversely affect the health of patients treated with them 

linde’s products and services if defective or not handled or performed appropriately may lead to personal injuries business interruptions environmental damages or other significant damages which may result among other consequences in liability losses monetary penalties or compensation payments environmental cleanup costs or other costs and expenses exclusion from certain market sectors deemed important for future development of the business and loss of reputation all these consequences could have a material adverse effect on linde’s business and results of operations 

us civil liabilities may not be enforceable against linde 

linde is organized under the laws of ireland and substantial portions of its assets will be located outside of the united states in addition certain directors and officers of linde and its subsidiaries reside outside the united states as a result it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the united states upon linde or such persons or to enforce outside the united states judgments obtained against such persons in us courts in any action including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws in addition it may be difficult for investors to enforce in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the united states rights predicated upon the us federal securities laws 

a judgment for the payment of money rendered by a court in the united states based on civil liability would not be automatically enforceable in ireland there is no treaty between ireland and the united states providing for the reciprocal enforcement of foreign judgments the following requirements must be met before the foreign judgment will be deemed to be enforceable in ireland i the judgment must be for a definite sum ii the judgment must be final and conclusive and iii the judgment must be provided by a court of competent jurisdiction 

an irish court will also exercise its right to refuse judgment if the foreign judgment i was obtained by fraud ii violated irish public policy iii is in breach of natural justice or iv if the judgment is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment 

in addition there is doubt as to whether an irish court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability on linde or such persons in an original action predicated solely upon the us federal securities laws brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in ireland against linde or such member officer or expert respectively 

changes in tax laws or policy could adversely impact the company’s financial position or results of operations 

linde and its subsidiaries are subject to the tax rules and regulations in the us germany ireland the uk and other countries in which they operate those tax rules and regulations are subject to change on a prospective or retroactive basis under current economic and political conditions tax rates and policies in any jurisdiction including the us the uk and the eu are subject to significant changes which could result in a significant change to lindes current and deferred income tax in particular since linde is currently treated as uk tax resident any potential changes in the tax rules applying to uk taxresident companies would directly affect linde 

a change in linde’s tax residency could have a negative effect on the company’s future profitability and may trigger taxes on dividends or exit charges if linde ceases to be resident in the uk and becomes resident in another jurisdiction it may be subject to uk exit charges andor could become liable for additional tax charges in the other jurisdiction if linde were to be treated as resident in more than one jurisdiction it could be subject to duplicative taxation furthermore although linde is incorporated in ireland and is not expected to be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes it is possible that the irs could challenge this result or that changes in us federal income tax law could alter this result if the irs successfully asserted such a position or the law were to change significant adverse tax consequences may result for linde the company and linde’s shareholders 

changes in tax laws may result in higher tax expense and tax payments in addition changes in tax legislation and uncertainty about the tax environment in some regions may restrict lindes opportunity to enforce its respective rights under the law linde also operates in countries with complex tax regulations which could be interpreted in different ways linde and its subsidiaries are subject to audits by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions or other review actions by the relevant financial or tax authorities the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in linde’s or its subsidiaries’ financial statements and may materially affect their respective financial results for the period when such determination is made 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

linde has received no written sec staff comments regarding any of its exchange act reports which remain unresolved 




 item 2 properties 

linde plcs principal executive offices are located in owned office space in guildford united kingdom linde also owns principal administrative office space in danbury connecticut and houston texas united states and pullach germany 

due to the nature of linde’s industrial gas products it is generally uneconomical to transport them distances greater than a few hundred miles from the production facility as a result linde operates a significant number of production facilities spread globally throughout a number of geographic regions

results of operations 

the following table provides a summary of changes in consolidated sales 



2020 compared with 2019 

sales 

reported sales decreased 985 million or 3 for the 2020 year versus 2019 on an adjusted basis sales decreased 920 million in 2020 compared to 2019 

on a reported and adjusted basis sales decreased 3 volume decreased sales by 2 primarily driven by the impact of the macroeconomic slowdown partially offset by new project startups higher pricing across all geographic segments contributed 2 to sales currency translation decreased sales by 1 largely in the americas driven by the weakening of the brazilian real against the us dollar cost passthrough decreased sales by 1 with minimal impact on operating profit the impact of mergerrelated divestitures decreased sales by 65 million in 2020 these sales have been excluded from the adjusted numbers 

cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization   

cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization decreased 1261 million or 8 for the year primarily due to lower volumes and the impact of productivity initiatives cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization was 565 and 590 of sales respectively in 2020 compared to 2019 the decrease as a percentage of sales was due primarily to the impact of cost reduction programs and productivity initiatives and the impact of lower cost passthrough

depreciation and amortization 

reported depreciation and amortization expense decreased 49 million or 1 versus 2019 the decrease is primarily due to currency translation impacts 

on an adjusted basis depreciation and amortization expense decreased 29 million or 1 versus 2019 the decrease is primarily due to currency translation impacts which decreased depreciation and amortization by approximately 39 million in 2020 slightly offset by new project start ups primarily in apac and the americas 

cost reduction programs and other charges 

linde recorded cost reduction programs and other charges of 506 million and 567 million for 2020 and 2019 respectively primarily associated with the companys cost reduction program which represents charges for achieving synergies and cost efficiencies related to the merger 2019 also included an asset impairment of approximately 73 million related to a joint venture in apac resulting from an unfavorable arbitration ruling see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

on an adjusted basis these costs have been eliminated in both periods 

operating profit 

reported operating profit increased 389 million in 2020 or 13 on an adjusted basis operating profit increased 525 million or 10 for 2020 versus 2019 

on a reported basis operating profit increased 389 million or 13 in 2020 the increase in the year was driven by higher price and the benefit of cost reduction programs and productivity initiatives cost reduction programs and other charges 

were 506 million in 2020 and 567 million in 2019 2019 also included a 164 million one time net gain on sale of business 

on an adjusted basis which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting cost reduction programs and other charges and net gains from mergerrelated divestitures in 2019 operating profit increased 525 million or 10 operating profit growth was driven by higher price and the benefit of cost reduction programs and productivity initiatives which were partially offset by lower volumes unfavorable currency impacts and cost inflation a discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows 

interest expense  net 

reported interest expense – net in 2020 increased 77 million or 203 versus 2019 and included a 16 million charge for the early redemption of bonds due in 2021 see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements on an adjusted basis interest expense increased 50 million or 37 in 2020 as compared to 2019 

on both a reported and adjusted basis the increase year over year included the impact of unfavorable foreign currency revaluation on unhedged intercompany loans and lower interest income partially offset by a lower effective borrowing rate 

net pension and opeb cost benefit excluding service cost 

reported net pension and opeb cost benefit excluding service cost was a benefit of 177 million in 2020 versus a benefit of 32 million in 2019 2020 included pension settlement charges of 6 million while 2019 included pension settlement charges of 97 million and a net 8 million curtailment charge see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements excluding the impact of these charges the net pension and opeb benefit excluding service cost increased 46 million in 2020 as the benefit of lower interest cost due to the low discount rate environment more than offset higher amortization of deferred losses 

effective tax rate 

the reported effective tax rate etr for 2020 was 250 versus 263 in 2019 the decrease in the reported etr is primarily due to higher tax benefits from share option exercises and higher tax expense in 2019 related to divestitures 

on an adjusted basis the etr for 2020 was 238 versus 240 in 2019 the decrease in the adjusted etr is primarily due to higher tax benefits from share option exercises 

income from equity investments 

reported income from equity investments for 2020 was 85 million as compared to 114 million in 2019 on an adjusted basis income from equity investments for 2020 was 142 million versus 171 million in 2019 the decrease in the reported and adjusted income from equity investments was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency revaluation impacts on an unhedged loan of an investment in emea 

noncontrolling interests from continuing operations 

at december 31 2020 noncontrolling interests from continuing operations consisted primarily of noncontrolling shareholders’ investments in apac primarily in china and surface technologies 

reported noncontrolling interests from continuing operations increased 36 million to 125 million in 2020 from 89 million in 2019 primarily driven by the noncontrolling interest impact of 33 million for an asset impairment charge in the third quarter 2019 related to a joint venture in apac 

adjusted noncontrolling interests from continuing operations increased 8 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 

income from continuing operations 

reported income from continuing operations increased 314 million or 14 primarily due to higher overall operating profit and a lower effective tax rate 

on an adjusted basis which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and other nongaap adjustments income from continuing operations increased 368 million or 9 in 2020 versus 2019 the increase was primarily due to higher adjusted operating profit partially offset by higher interest expense and lower equity income 

diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 

reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 070 or 18 in 2020 as compared to 2019 

on an adjusted basis diluted eps of 823 in 2020 increased 12 versus 2019 primarily due to higher income from continuing operations and lower diluted shares outstanding 

employees 

the number of employees at december 31 2020 was 74207 a decrease of 5679 employees from december 31 2019 primarily driven by cost reduction actions and divestitures 

other financial data

see the nongaap financial measures section for definitions and reconciliations of these nongaap measures to reported gaap amounts 

other comprehensive income loss 

other comprehensive income for the year ended december 31 2020 of 157 million resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of 595 million largely offset by a decrease in the funded status of the companys retirement obligations of 469 million driven by the low discount rate environment the translation adjustments reflect the impact of translating local currency foreign subsidiary financial statements to us dollars and are largely driven by the movement of the us dollar against major currencies including the euro the chinese yuan and the british pound see the currency section of the mda for exchange rates used for translation purposes and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income by segment 

related party transactions 

the company’s related parties are primarily unconsolidated equity affiliates the company did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated with independent parties 

environmental matters 

linde’s principal operations relate to the production and distribution of atmospheric and other industrial gases which historically have not had a significant impact on the environment however worldwide costs relating to environmental protection may continue to grow due to increasingly stringent laws and regulations and lindes ongoing commitment to rigorous internal standards in addition linde may face physical risks from climate change and extreme weather 

climate change 

linde operates in jurisdictions that have or are developing laws andor regulations to reduce or mitigate the perceived adverse effects of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and faces a highly uncertain regulatory environment in this area for example the us environmental protection agency epa has promulgated rules requiring reporting of ghg emissions and linde and many of its suppliers and customers are subject to these rules epa has also promulgated regulations to restrict ghg emissions including final rules regulating ghg emissions from lightduty vehicles and certain large manufacturing facilities many of which are linde suppliers or customers in addition to these developments in the united states several other countries worldwide have already implemented carbon taxation or trading systems which impact the companys customers and linde operations among those regulations in china singapore and the european union among other impacts such regulations are expected to raise the cost of energy which is a significant cost for linde nevertheless lindes longterm customer contracts routinely provide rights to recover increased electricity natural gas and other costs that are incurred by the company as a result of climate change regulation 

linde anticipates continued growth in its hydrogen business due to increased focus on air quality hydrogen production plants and a large number of other manufacturing and electricitygenerating plants have been identified in california and the european union as a source of carbon dioxide emissions and these plants are subject to capandtrade regulations in those jurisdictions linde believes it will be able to mitigate the costs of these regulations through the terms of its product supply contracts however legislation that limits ghg emissions may impact growth by increasing capital compliance operating and maintenance costs andor decreasing demand 

to manage business risks from current and potential ghg emission regulation as well as physical consequences of climate change linde actively monitors current developments evaluates the direct and indirect business risks and takes appropriate actions among others actions include increasing relevant resources and training maintaining contingency plans obtaining advice and counsel from expert vendors insurance providers and industry experts incorporating ghg provisions in commercial agreements and conducting regular reviews of the business risks with management although there are considerable uncertainties linde believes that the business risk from potential regulations can be effectively managed through its commercial contracts additionally linde does not anticipate any material effects regarding its plant operations or business arising from potential physical risks of climate change 

linde continuously seeks opportunities to optimize energy use and ghg footprint through research and development in customer applications and rigorous operational energy efficiency investment in renewable energy and purchasing hydrogen as a chemical byproduct where feasible linde maintains related performance improvement targets and reports progress against these targets regularly to business management and annually to lindes board of directors 

at the same time linde may benefit from business opportunities arising from governmental regulation of ghg and other emissions uncertain costs of energy and certain natural resources the development of renewable energy alternatives and new technologies that help extract natural gas improve air quality increase energy efficiency and mitigate the impacts of climate change linde continues to develop new applications that can lower emissions including ghg emissions in lindes processes and help customers lower energy consumption and increase product throughput stricter regulation of water quality in emerging economies such as china provide a growing market for a number of gases eg oxygen for wastewater treatment increased concern about drought in areas such as california and australia may create additional markets for carbon dioxide for desalination renewable fuel standards in the european union and us create a market for secondgeneration biofuels which use industrial gases such as oxygen carbon dioxide and hydrogen 

costs relating to the protection of the environment 

environmental protection costs in 2020 were not significant linde anticipates that future annual environmental protection expenditures will be similar to 2020 subject to any significant changes in existing laws and regulations based on historical results and current estimates management does not believe that environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position the consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any given year 

legal proceedings 

see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning legal proceedings 

retirement benefits 

pensions 

the net periodic benefit cost benefit for the us and international pension plans was a benefit of 28 million in 2020 and costs of 107 million and 24 million in 2019 and 2018 respectively 2019 net periodic pension cost included pension settlement charges of 97 million related to lump sum payments which were triggered by either a change in control provision or mergerrelated divestitures and a net curtailment charge of 8 million for termination benefits primarily in connection with a defined benefit pension plan freeze settlement charges were 6 million and 14 million for 2020 and 2018 respectively 

the funded status pension benefit obligation pbo less the fair value of plan assets for the us plans was a deficit of 436 million and 504 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the funded status for international plans was a deficit of 2334 million and 1801 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively in the us the benefit from the actual return on assets more than offset the impact of unfavorable liability experience primarily resulting from the low discount rate environment for the international plans the unfavorable impact of lower discount rates outweighed favorable plan asset returns 

global pension contributions were 91 million in 2020 94 million in 2019 and 87 million in 2018 at a minimum linde contributes to its pension plans to comply with local regulatory requirements eg erisa in the us discretionary contributions in excess of the local minimum requirements are made based on many factors including longterm projections of the plans funded status the economic environment potential risk of overfunding pension insurance costs and alternative uses of cash changes to these factors can impact the timing of discretionary contributions from year to year estimated required contributions for 2021 are currently expected to be in the range of 70 million to 80 million 

linde assumes expected returns on plan assets for 2021 of 700 and 527 f or the us and international plans respectively which are consistent with the longterm expected returns on its investment portfolios 

excluding the impact of any settlements 2021 consolidated pension expense is expected to be a benefit of approximately 36 million th e benefit derived from the expected return on assets assumption for lindes most significant plans is anticipated to more than offset the expense from service and interest cost accruals and the higher amortization of deferred losses 

refer to the critical accounting policies section and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the company’s retirement benefits including a description of the various retirement plans and the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost benefit and funded status 

insurance 

linde purchases insurance to limit a variety of property and casualty risks including those related to property business interruption thirdparty liability and workers’ compensation currently the company self retains up to 10 million per occurrence for vehicle liability in the united states 5 million per occurrence for workers compensation and general liability in addition the company self retains risk up to €5 million at its various properties worldwide for property damage resulting from fire flood and other perils effecting its properties along with a separate €5 million deductible on all business interruption resulting from a major peril loss to mitigate its aggregate loss potential above these retentions the company purchases catastrophic insurance coverage from highly rated insurance companies the company does not currently operate or participate in any captive insurance companies or other nontraditional risk transfer alternatives 

at december 31 2020 and 2019 the company had recorded a total of 71 million and 66 million respectively representing an estimate of the retained liability for the ultimate cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet dates the estimated liability is established using statistical analysis and is based upon historical experience actuarial assumptions and professional judgment these estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency and are subject to a significant degree of inherent variability if actual claims differ from the company’s estimates they will be adjusted at that time and financial results could be impacted 

linde recognizes estimated insurance proceeds relating to damages at the time of loss only to the extent of incurred losses any insurance recoveries for business interruption and for property damages in excess of the net book value of the property are recognized only when realized or pending payments confirmed by its insurance companies 

segment discussion 

linde’s operations consist of two major product lines industrial gases and engineering as further described in the following paragraph linde’s industrial gases operations are managed on a geographic basis which represents three of the companys reportable segments  americas emea europemiddle eastafrica and apac asiasouth pacific a fourth reportable segment which represents the companys engineering business designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications specifically for end customers and is managed on a worldwide basis operating in all geographic segments other consists of corporate costs and a few smaller businesses which individually do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation 

the industrial gases product line centers on the manufacturing and distribution of atmospheric gases oxygen nitrogen argon rare gases and process gases carbon dioxide helium hydrogen electronic gases specialty gases acetylene many of these products are coproducts of the same manufacturing process linde manufactures and distributes nearly all of its products and manages its customer relationships on a regional basis linde’s industrial gases are distributed to various endmarkets within a regional segment through one of three basic distribution methods onsite or tonnage merchant or bulk and packaged or cylinder gases the distribution methods are generally integrated in order to best meet the customer’s needs and very few of its products can be economically transported outside of a region therefore the distribution economics are specific to the various geographies in which the company operates and are consistent with how management assesses performance 

the company’s measure of profitloss for segment reporting purposes is segment operating profit segment operating profit is defined as operating profit excluding purchase accounting impacts of the linde ag merger intercompany royalties and items not indicative of ongoing business trends this is the manner in which the company’s chief operating decision maker codm assesses performance and allocates resources

cash used for financing activities was 3345 million in 2020 compared to 8997 million in 2019 cash provided by debt was 1313 million in 2020 versus cash used for debt of 1260 million in 2019 primarily due to bond issuances in 2020 and increased commercial paper borrowings net of bond repayments net purchases of ordinary shares were 2410 million in 2020 versus 2586 million in 2019 cash dividends increased to 2028 million in 2020 versus 1891 million in 2019 driven primarily by a 10 increase in dividends per share from 350 per share to 385 per share the 2019 period also includes an 

outflow of approximately 32 billion relating to the cashmerger squeezeout of the 8 of linde ag shares completed on april 8 2019 see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

the company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility cash reserves and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world at december 31 2020 lindes credit ratings as reported by standard  poor’s and moody’s were a1 and p1 for shortterm debt respectively and a and a2 for longterm debt respectively 

note 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company’s debt activity in 2020 current debt position debt covenants and the available credit facilities and note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments lindes credit facilities are with major financial institutions and are noncancelable until maturity therefore the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities if requested to be low linde’s major bank credit and longterm debt agreements contain standard covenants the company was in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2020 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future 

the company maintains a 5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants no borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of december 31 2020 the company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets andor other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from moody’s and standard  poor’s 

linde’s total net debt outstanding at december 31 2020 was 12400 million 1144 million higher than 11256 million at december 31 2019 the december 31 2020 net debt balance includes 15048 million in public securities 1106 million representing primarily worldwide bank borrowings net of 3754 million of cash linde’s global effective borrowing rate was approximately 2 for 2020 

in may 2020 linde issued €750 million of 0250 notes due 2027 and €750 million 0550 notes due 2032 in august 2020 linde issued 700 million of 1100 notes due 2030 and 300 million of 2000 notes due 2050 in september 2020 the company repaid €1000 million in 175 notes and 300 million of 225 notes that became due in december 2020 the company repaid 500 million of 405 notes and 500 million of 300 notes that were due in 2021 resulting in a 16 million interest charge see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

on january 25 2021 the company’s board of directors approved the additional repurchase of 50 billion of its ordinary shares for additional information related to the share repurchase programs see part ii item 5 market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2020 linde had undrawn outstanding letters of credit bank guarantees and surety bonds entered into in connection with normal business operations and they are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on linde’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

critical accounting policies 

the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding linde’s financial statements and accompanying notes prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap their application places significant importance on management’s judgment as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain linde’s financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected if actual results differ from estimates made these policies are determined by management and have been reviewed by linde’s audit committee 

revenue recognition 

longterm construction contracts 

the company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other varied gas production and processing plants manufactured specifically for end customers revenue from sale of equipment is generally recognized over time as linde has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance does not create an asset with alternative use for contracts recognized over time revenue is recognized primarily using a cost incurred input method costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations costs incurred include material labor and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer contract modifications are typically accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inceptiontodate effect of such change we assess performance as progress towards completion is achieved on specific projects earnings will be impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects 

pension benefits 

pension benefits represent financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments significant estimates are required to calculate pension expense and liabilities related to the company’s plans the company utilizes the services of independent actuaries whose models are used to facilitate these calculations 

several key assumptions are used in actuarial models to calculate pension expense and liability amounts recorded in the financial statements management believes the three most significant variables in the models are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate and the expected rate of compensation increase the actuarial models also use assumptions for various other factors including longterm inflation rates employee turnover retirement age and mortality linde management believes the assumptions used in the actuarial calculations are reasonable reflect the company’s experience and expectations for the future and are within accepted practices in each of the respective geographic locations in which it operates actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors the sensitivities to each of the key assumptions presented below exclude the impact of special items that occurred during the year 

the weightedaverage expected longterm rates of return on pension plan assets were 700 for us plans and 531 for international plans for the year ended december 31 2020 727 and 515 respectively at december 31 2019 the expected longterm rate of return on the us and international plan assets is estimated based on the plans investment strategy and asset allocation historical capita l market performance and to a lesser extent historical plan performance a 050 change in these expected longterm rates of return with all other variables held constant would change linde’s pension expense by approximately 42 million 

the company has consistently used a marketrelated value of assets rather than the fair value at the measurement date to determine annual pension expense the marketrelated value recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period as a result changes in the fair value of assets from year to year are not immediately reflected in the company’s annual pension expense instead annual pension expense in future periods will be impacted as deferred investment gains or losses 

are r ecognized in the marketrelated value of assets over the fiveyear period the consolidated marketrelated value of assets was 9408 million or 555 million lower than the fair value of assets of 9963 million at december 31 2020 these net deferred investment losses of 555 million wil l be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of assets ratably over the next four years and will impact future pension expense future actual investment gains or losses will impact the marketrelated value of assets and therefore will impact future annual pension expense in a similar manner 

discount rates are used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities and pension costs and are determined annually by management the company measures the service and interest cost components of pension and opeb expense for significant us and international plans using the spot rate approach us plans that do not use the spot rate approach continue to determine discount rates by using a cash flow matching model provided by the companys independent actuaries the model includes a portfolio of corporate bonds graded aa or better by at least half of the ratings agencies and matches the us plans projected cash flows to the calculated spot rates discount rates for the remaining international plans are based on market yields for highquality fixed income investments representing the approximate duration of the pension liabilities on the measurement date refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial stat ements for a summary of the discount rates used to calculate plan liabilities and benefit costs and to the retirement benefits section of the consolidated results and other information section of this mda for a further discussion of 2020 benefit costs a 050 reduction in discount rates with all other variables held constant would increase linde’s pension expense by approximately 42 million whereas a 050 increase in discount rates would result in a decrease of 12 million a 050 reduction in discount rates would increase the pbo by approximately 1054 million whereas a 050 increase in discount rates would have a favorable impact to the pbo of approximately 932 million 

the weightedaverage expected rate of compensation increase was 325 for us plans and 255 for international plans at december 31 2020 325 and 246 respectively at december 31 2019 the estimated annual compensation increase is determined by management every year and is based on historical trends and market indices a 050 change in the expected rate of compensation increase with all other variables held constant would change linde’s pension expense by approximately 8 million and would impact the pbo by approximately 70 million 

asset impairments 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles assets 

at december 31 2020 the company had goodwill of 28201 million and 1992 million of other indefinitelived intangible assets goodwill represents the aggregate of the excess consideration paid for acquired businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired indefinitelived other intangibles relate to the linde name 

the company performs a goodwill impairment test annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred 

the impairment tests performed during the fourth quarter of 2020 indicated no impairment at december 31 2020 linde’s enterprise value was approximately 150 billion outstanding shares multiplied by the yearend stock price plus net debt and without any control premium while its total capital was approximately 62 billion 

the impairment test allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value then the company will estimate and compare the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying value including goodwill reporting units are determined based on one level below the operating segment level 

management believes that the quantitative and qualitative factors used to perform its annual goodwill impairment assessment are appropriate and reasonable although the 2020 assessment indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value changes in circumstances or conditions affecting this analysis could have a significant impact on the fair value determination which could then result in a material impairment charge to the companys results of operations reporting units with greater concentration of linde ag assets fair valued during the 2018 praxair inc and linde ag merger are at greater risk of impairment in future periods 

other indefinitelived intangible assets from linde ag recently fair valued are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred and no impairments were indicated 

see notes 9 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

longlived assets 

longlived assets including property plant and equipment and finitelived other intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an individual asset or asset group may not be recoverable for purposes of this test asset groups are determined based upon the lowest level for which there are independent and identifiable cash flows based upon lindes business model an asset group may be a single plant and related assets used to support onsite merchant and packaged gas customers alternatively the asset group may a collection of distribution related assets cylinders distribution centers and stores or be a pipeline complex which includes multiple interdependent plants and related assets connected by pipelines within a geographic area used to support the same distribution methods 

income taxes 

at december 31 2020 linde had deferred tax assets of 2270 million net of valuation allowances of 243 million and deferred tax liabilities of 8706 million at december 31 2020 uncertain tax positions totaled 452 million see note 1 and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements income tax expense was 847 million for the year ended december 31 2020 or about 250 of pretax income see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to taxes 

in the preparation of consolidated financial statements linde estimates income taxes based on diverse legislative and regulatory structures that exist in various jurisdictions where the company conducts business deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent tax benefits or obligations that arise from temporary differences due to differing treatment of certain items for accounting and income tax purposes linde evaluates deferred tax assets each period to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character eg capital gain versus ordinary income treatment amount and timing to result in their recovery a valuation allowance is established when management determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized to reduce the assets to their realizable value considerable judgments are required in establishing deferred tax valuation allowances and in assessing exposures related to tax matters as events and circumstances change related reserves and valuation allowances are adjusted to income at that time linde’s tax returns are subject to audit and local taxing authorities could challenge the company’s tax positions the company’s practice is to review tax filing positions by jurisdiction and to record provisions for uncertain income tax positions including interest and penalties when applicable linde believes it records andor discloses such potential tax liabilities as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its income tax liabilities and recoverable tax assets if new information becomes available adjustments are charged or credited against income at that time management does not anticipate that such adjustments would have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s reported results of operations 

contingencies 

the company accrues liabilities for nonincome tax contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated while contingent gains are recognized only when realized or realizable if new information becomes available or losses are sustained in excess of recorded amounts adjustments are charged against income at that time management does not anticipate that in the aggregate such losses would have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s reported results of operations 

linde is subject to various claims legal proceedings and government investigations that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business these actions are based upon alleged environmental tax antitrust and personal injury claims among others see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements such contingencies are significant and the accounting requires considerable management judgments in analyzing each matter to assess the likely outcome and the need for establishing appropriate liabilities and providing adequate disclosures linde believes it records andor discloses such contingencies as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its liabilities 

new accounting standards 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning new accounting standards and the impact of the implementation of these standards on the company’s financial statements 

fair value measurements 

linde does not expect changes in the aggregate fair value of its financial assets and liabilities to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements

the following tables present summarized financial information for linde plc linde inc linde gmbh and linde finance on a combined basis after eliminating intercompany transactions and balances between them and excluding investments in and equity in earnings from nonguarantor subsidiaries 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

linde is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates the objective of financial risk management at linde is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company’s earnings cash flows and equity 

to manage these risks linde uses various derivative financial instruments including interestrate swaps treasury rate locks currency swaps forward contracts and commodity contracts linde only uses commonly traded and nonleveraged instruments these contracts are entered into primarily with major banking institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss also see note 1 and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of linde’s accounting policies and use of such instruments 

the following discussion presents the sensitivity of the market value earnings and cash flows of linde’s financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest and exchange rates assuming these changes occurred at december 31 2020 the range of changes chosen for these discussions reflects linde’s view of changes which are reasonably possible over a oneyear period market values represent the present values of projected future cash flows based on interest rate and exchange rate assumptions 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2020 linde had debt totaling 16154 million 13956 million at december 31 2019 for fixedrate instruments interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows conversely for floatingrate instruments interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of the instrument but impact future earnings and cash flows assuming that other factors are held constant at december 31 2020 including the impact of derivatives linde had fixedrate debt of 10365 million and floatingrate debt of 5789 million representing 64 and 36 respectively of total debt at december 31 2019 linde had fixedrate debt of 10799 million and floatingrate debt of 3157 million representing 77 and 23 respectively of total debt 

fixed rate debt 

in order to mitigate interest rate risk when considered appropriate interestrate swaps are entered into as hedges of underlying financial instruments to effectively change the characteristics of the interest rate without actually changing the underlying financial instrument at december 31 2020 linde had fixedtofloating interest rate swaps outstanding that were designated as hedging instruments of the underlying debt issuances  refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information this sensitivity analysis assumes that holding all other variables constant such as foreign exchange rates swaps and debt levels a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the unrealized fair market value of the fixedrate debt portfolio by approximately 674 million 473 million in 2019 a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate 61 million increase to derivative assets recorded 

variable rate debt 

at december 31 2020 the aftertax earnings and cash flows impact of a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates including offsetting impact of derivatives on the variablerate debt portfolio would be approximately 44 million 48 million in 2019 

foreign currency risk 

linde’s exchangerate exposures result primarily from its investments and ongoing operations in latin america primarily brazil and mexico europe primarily germany scandinavia and the uk canada asia pacific primarily australia and china and other business transactions such as the procurement of equipment from foreign sources linde frequently utilizes currency contracts to hedge these exposures at december 31 2020 linde had a notional amount outstanding of 7553 million 9713 million at december 31 2019 related to foreign exchange contracts the majority of these were to hedge recorded balance sheet exposures primarily intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

holding all other variables constant if there were a 10 increase in foreigncurrency exchange rates for the portfolio the fair market value of foreigncurrency contracts outstanding at december 31 2020 would decrease by approximately 99 million and at december 31 2019 would increase by approximately 194 million which would be largely offset by an offsetting loss or gain on the foreigncurrency fluctuation of the underlying exposure being hedged

 item 1 business 

general 

linde plc is a public limited company formed under the laws of ireland with its principal offices in the united kingdom linde plc was formed in 2017 in accordance with the requirements of the business combination agreement dated june 1 2017 as amended between linde plc praxair inc praxair and linde aktiengesellschaft linde ag effective october 31 2018 the business combination was completed and linde plc is comprised of the businesses of praxair and linde ag hereinafter the combined group will be referred to as the company or linde 

the business combination brought together two leading companies in the global industrial gases industry leveraging the proven strengths of each linde believes the merger will combine linde ag’s longheld expertise in technology with praxair’s efficient operating model thus creating a global leader the company is expected to have strong positions in key geographies and end markets that will create a more diverse and balanced global portfolio 

linde is the largest industrial gas company worldwide and is a major technological innovator in the industrial gases industry its primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases oxygen nitrogen argon and rare gases and process gases carbon dioxide helium hydrogen electronic gases specialty gases and acetylene the company also designs and builds equipment that produces industrial gases primarily for internal use and offers customers a wide range of gas production and processing services such as olefin plants natural gas plants air separation plants hydrogen and synthesis gas plants and other types of plants 

linde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare petroleum refining manufacturing food beverage carbonation fiberoptics steel making aerospace chemicals electronics and water treatment 

in 2018 the company praxair and linde ag entered into various agreements with regulatory authorities to satisfy antitrust requirements to secure approval to consummate the business combination these agreements required the sale of the majority of praxairs european industrial gases business completed on december 3 2018 the majority of linde ags americas industrial gases business completed on march 1 2019 select assets of linde ags south korea industrial gases business completed april 30 2019 select assets of praxairs indian industrial gases business completed july 12 2019 select assets of linde ags indian industrial gases business completed december 16 2019 as well as certain divestitures of other praxair and linde ag businesses in asia that are expected to be sold in 2020 as of december 31 2018 and until the completion of the majority of such divestitures linde ag and praxair were obligated to operate their businesses globally as separate and independent companies and not coordinate any of their commercial operations the us federal trade commissions “ftc” hold separate order “hso” restrictions were lifted march 1 2019 concurrent with the sale of the required mergerrelated divestitures in the united states see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to divestitures 

praxair was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the business combination accordingly the historical financial statements of praxair for the periods prior to the business combination are considered to be the historical financial statements of the company the results of linde ag are included in lindes consolidated results from the date of the completion of the business combination forward during 2018 the company reported its continuing operations in six reporting segments under which it managed its operations assessed performance and reported earnings north america south america asia europe surface technologies and linde ag effective with the lifting of the hold separate order on march 1 2019 new operating segments were established linde’s industrial gases operations are managed on a geographic basis which represents three of the companys new reportable segments  americas emea europemiddle eastafrica and apac asiasouth pacific a fourth reportable segment which represents the companys engineering business designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications specifically for end customers and is managed on a worldwide basis operating in all geographic segments other consists of corporate costs and a few smaller businesses which individually do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation 

linde’s sales were 28228 million  14836 million  and 11358 million for 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis for a discussion of consolidated sales and note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to linde’s reportable segments 

industrial gases products and manufacturing processes 

atmospheric gases are the highest volume products produced by linde using air as its raw material linde produces oxygen nitrogen and argon through several air separation processes of which cryogenic air separation is the most prevalent rare gases such as krypton neon and xenon are also produced through cryogenic air separation as a pioneer 

in the industrial gases industry linde is a leader in developing a wide range of proprietary and patented applications and supply systems technology linde also led the development and commercialization of noncryogenic air separation technologies for the production of industrial gases these technologies open important new markets and optimize production capacity for the company by lowering the cost of supplying industrial gases these technologies include proprietary vacuum pressure swing adsorption “vpsa” and membrane separation to produce gaseous oxygen and nitrogen respectively 

process gases including carbon dioxide hydrogen carbon monoxide helium specialty gases and acetylene are produced by methods other than air separation most carbon dioxide is purchased from byproduct sources including chemical plants refineries and industrial processes or is recovered from carbon dioxide wells carbon dioxide is processed in linde’s plants to produce commercial and foodgrade carbon dioxide hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be produced by either steam methane reforming or autothermal reforming of natural gas or other feed streams such as naphtha hydrogen is also produced by purifying byproduct sources obtained from the chemical and petrochemical industries acetylene is primarily sourced as a chemical byproduct but may also be produced from calcium carbide and water 

industrial gases distribution 

there are three basic distribution methods for industrial gases i onsite or tonnage ii merchant or bulk liquid and iii packaged or cylinder gases these distribution methods are often integrated with products from all three supply modes coming from the same plant the method of supply is generally determined by the lowest cost means of meeting the customer’s needs depending upon factors such as volume requirements purity pattern of usage and the form in which the product is used as a gas or as a cryogenic liquid 

onsite customers that require the largest volumes of product typically oxygen nitrogen and hydrogen and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas onsite plants linde constructs plants on or adjacent to these customers’ sites and supplies the product directly to customers by pipeline onsite product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 1020 years and containing minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions many of the cryogenic onsite plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market therefore plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer advanced air separation processes allow onsite delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements customers using these systems usually enter into requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from ten to twenty years 

merchant the merchant business is generally associated with distributable liquid oxygen nitrogen argon carbon dioxide hydrogen and helium the deliveries generally are made from linde’s plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customers site which are owned and maintained by linde and leased to the customer due to distribution cost merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced merchant argon hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances the customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three to sevenyear requirement contracts 

packaged gases customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in metal containers called cylinders under medium to high pressure packaged gases include atmospheric gases carbon dioxide hydrogen helium acetylene and related products linde also produces and distributes in cylinders a wide range of specialty gases and mixtures cylinders may be delivered to the customer’s site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store packaged gases are generally sold under one to threeyear supply contracts and through purchase orders 

a substantial amount of the cylinder gases sold in the united states are distributed by independent distributors that buy merchant gases in liquid form and repackage the products in their facilities packaged gas distributors including linde also distribute hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers over time linde has acquired a number of independent industrial gases and welding products distributors at various locations in the united states and continues to sell merchant gases to other independent distributors between its own distribution business joint ventures and sales to independent distributors linde is represented in 48 states the district of columbia and puerto rico

 item 1a risk factors 

due to the size and geographic reach of the company’s operations a wide range of factors many of which are outside of the company’s control could materially affect the company’s future operations and financial performance management believes the following risks may significantly impact the company 

the company may fail to realize the anticipated strategic and financial benefits sought from the business combination 

the company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the business combination between praxair inc and linde ag which was completed on october 31 2018 the success of the business combination will depend on among other things the company’s ability to combine praxair inc’s and linde ag’s businesses in a manner that facilitates growth and realizes the anticipated annual synergies and cost reductions without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth the actual integration will continue to involve complex operational technological and personnelrelated challenges difficulties in the integration of the businesses which may result in significant costs and delays include 

 

these and other factors could result in increased costs and diversion of management’s time and energy as well as decreases in the amount of expected revenue and earnings the integration process and other disruptions resulting from the business combination may also adversely affect the company’s relationships with employees suppliers customers distributors licensors and others with whom praxair inc and linde ag have business or other dealings and difficulties in integrating the businesses could harm the reputation of the company 

if the company is not able to successfully integrate the businesses of praxair inc and linde ag in an efficient costeffective and timely manner the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the business combination may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

weakening economic conditions in markets in which linde does business may adversely impact its financial results andor cash flows 

linde serves a diverse group of industries across more than 100 countries which generally leads to financial stability through various business cycles however a broad decline in general economic or business conditions in the industries served by its customers could adversely affect the demand for linde’s products and impair the ability of its customers to satisfy their obligations to linde resulting in uncollected receivables andor unanticipated contract terminations or project delays for example global political and economic uncertainty could reduce investment activities of linde’s customers which could adversely affect linde’s business 

in addition many of linde’s customers are in businesses that are cyclical in nature such as the chemicals electronics metals and energy industries downturns in these industries may adversely impact linde during these cycles additionally such conditions could impact the utilization of linde’s manufacturing capacity which may require it to 

recognize impairment losses on tangible assets such as property plant and equipment as well as intangible assets such as goodwill customer relationships or intellectual property 

increases in the cost of energy and raw materials andor disruption in the supply of these materials could result in lost sales or reduced profitability 

energy is the single largest cost item in the production and distribution of industrial gases most of linde’s energy requirements are in the form of electricity natural gas and diesel fuel for distribution linde attempts to minimize the financial impact of variability in these costs through the management of customer contracts and reducing demand through operational productivity and energy efficiency large customer contracts typically have escalation and passthrough clauses to recover energy and feedstock costs such attempts may not successfully mitigate cost variability which could negatively impact linde’s financial condition or results of operations the supply of energy has not been a significant issue in the geographic areas where linde conducts business however regional energy conditions are unpredictable and may pose future risk 

for carbon dioxide carbon monoxide helium hydrogen specialty gases and surface technologies raw materials are largely purchased from outside sources where feasible linde sources several of these raw materials including carbon dioxide hydrogen and calcium carbide as chemical or industrial byproducts in addition linde has contracts or commitments for or readily available sources of most of these raw materials however their longterm availability and prices are subject to market conditions a disruption in supply of such raw materials could impact linde’s ability to meet contractual supply commitments 

linde’s international operations are subject to the risks of doing business abroad and international events and circumstances may adversely impact its business financial condition or results of operations 

linde has substantial international operations which are subject to risks including devaluations in currency exchange rates transportation delays and interruptions political and economic instability and disruptions restrictions on the transfer of funds trade conflicts and the imposition of duties and tariffs import and export controls changes in governmental policies labor unrest possible nationalization andor expropriation of assets domestic and international tax laws and compliance with governmental regulations these events could have an adverse effect on the international operations of linde in the future by reducing the demand for its products decreasing the prices at which it can sell its products reducing the revenue from international operations or otherwise having an adverse effect on its business for example linde has a meaningful presence in the uk and the uk’s ongoing exit process from the eu has continued to cause and may in the future cause political and economic uncertainty which could have an adverse impact on the markets which linde supplies 

currency exchange rate fluctuations and other related risks may adversely affect lindes results 

because a significant portion of lindes revenue is denominated in currencies other than its reporting currency the us dollar changes in exchange rates will produce fluctuations in revenue costs and earnings and may also affect the book value of assets and liabilities and related equity although the company from time to time utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these exposures its efforts to minimize currency exposure through such hedging transactions may not be successful depending on market and business conditions as a result fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect linde’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

macroeconomic factors may impact linde’s ability to obtain financing or increase the cost of obtaining financing which may adversely impact linde’s financial results andor cash flows 

volatility and disruption in the us european and global credit and equity markets from time to time could make it more difficult for linde to obtain financing for its operations andor could increase the cost of obtaining financing in addition linde’s borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on its performance as measured by certain criteria such as interest coverage and leverage ratios a decrease in these debt ratings could increase the cost of borrowing or make it more difficult to obtain financing 

an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets could negatively impact the companys financial results 

as of december 31 2019  the net carrying value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets was 27 billion and 2 billion  respectively primarily as a result of the business combination and the related acquisition method of accounting applied to linde ag in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the company periodically assesses these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and sustained market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairments to goodwill or other indefinitelived assets any charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse impact on lindes results of operations in the periods recognized 

catastrophic events could disrupt the operations of linde andor its customers and suppliers and may have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations 

the occurrence of catastrophic events or natural disasters such as extreme weather including hurricanes and floods health epidemics and acts of war or terrorism could disrupt or delay linde’s ability to produce and distribute its products to customers and could potentially expose linde to thirdparty liability claims in addition such events could impact linde’s customers and suppliers resulting in temporary or longterm outages andor the limitation of supply of energy and other raw materials used in normal business operations linde evaluates the direct and indirect business risks consults with vendors insurance providers and industry experts makes investments in suitably resilient design and technology and conducts regular reviews of the business risks with management despite these steps however these situations are outside linde’s control and may have a significant adverse impact on its financial results 

the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel may adversely impact linde’s business 

if linde fails to attract hire and retain qualified personnel it may not be able to develop market or sell its products or successfully manage its business linde is dependent upon a highly skilled experienced and efficient workforce to be successful much of linde’s competitive advantage is based on the expertise and experience of key personnel regarding marketing technology manufacturing and distribution infrastructure systems and products the inability to attract and hire qualified individuals or the loss of key employees in very skilled areas could have a negative effect on linde’s financial results 

if linde fails to keep pace with technological advances in the industry or if new technology initiatives do not become commercially accepted customers may not continue to buy linde’s products and results of operations could be adversely affected 

linde’s research and development is directed toward developing new and improved methods for the production and distribution of industrial gases the design and construction of plants and toward developing new markets and applications for the use of industrial and process gases this results in the introduction of new applications and the development of new advanced air separation process technologies as a result of these efforts linde develops new and proprietary technologies and employs necessary measures to protect such technologies within the global geographies in which linde operates these technologies help linde to create a competitive advantage and to provide a platform to grow its business if linde’s research and development activities do not keep pace with competitors or if linde does not create new technologies that benefit customers future results of operations could be adversely affected 

risks related to pension benefit plans may adversely impact linde’s results of operations and cash flows 

pension benefits represent significant financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments and asset returns significant estimates are required to calculate pension expense and liabilities related to linde’s plans linde utilizes the services of independent actuaries whose models are used to facilitate these calculations several key assumptions are used in the actuarial models to calculate pension expense and liability amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements in particular significant changes in actual investment returns on pension assets discount rates or legislative or regulatory changes could impact future results of operations and required pension contributions 

operational risks may adversely impact linde’s business or results of operations 

linde’s operating results are dependent on the continued operation of its production facilities and its ability to meet customer contract requirements and other needs insufficient or excess capacity threatens linde’s ability to generate competitive profit margins and may expose linde to liabilities related to contract commitments operating results are also dependent on linde’s ability to complete new construction projects on time on budget and in accordance with performance requirements failure to do so may expose linde’s business to loss of revenue potential litigation and loss of business reputation 

also inherent in the management of linde’s production facilities and delivery systems including storage vehicle transportation and pipelines are operational risks that require continuous training oversight and control material operating failures at production storage facilities or pipelines including fire toxic release and explosions or the occurrence of vehicle transportation accidents could result in loss of life damage to the environment loss of production andor extensive property damage all of which may negatively impact linde’s financial results 

linde may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions and breaches in data security 

linde relies on information technology systems and networks for business and operational activities and also stores and processes sensitive business and proprietary information in these systems and networks these systems are susceptible to outages due to fire flood power loss telecommunications failures viruses breakins and similar events or breaches of security 

linde has taken steps to address these risks and concerns by implementing advanced security technologies internal controls network and data center resiliency and recovery process despite these steps however operational failures and breaches of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to the loss or disclosure of confidential information result in business interruption or malfunction or regulatory actions and have a material adverse impact on linde’s operations reputation and financial results 

the inability to effectively integrate acquisitions or collaborate with joint venture partners could adversely impact linde’s financial position and results of operations 

in addition to the business combination linde has evaluated and expects to continue to evaluate a wide array of potential strategic acquisitions and joint ventures many of these transactions if consummated could be material to its financial condition and results of operations in addition the process of integrating an acquired company business or group of assets may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures although historically linde has been successful with its acquisition strategy and execution the areas where linde may face risks include 

 

foreign acquisitions and joint ventures involve unique risks in addition to those mentioned herein including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages currency risks and the particular economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries 

also the anticipated benefit of potential future acquisitions may not materialize future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or impairments of goodwill any of which could adversely impact linde’s financial results 

linde is subject to a variety of international laws and government regulations and changes in or failure to comply with these laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on the company’s business financial position and results of operations 

linde is subject to regulations in the following areas among others 

 

changes in these or other regulatory areas such as evolving environmental legislation in china may impact linde’s profitability and may give rise to new or increased compliance risks it may become more complex and costly to ensure compliance and the level of sanctions in the event of noncompliance may rise such changes may also restrict linde’s ability to compete effectively in the marketplace noncompliance with such laws and regulations could result in penalties or sanctions cancellation of marketing rights or restrictions on participation in or even exclusion from public tender proceedings all of which could have a material adverse impact on linde’s financial results andor reputation 

doing business globally requires linde to comply with anticorruption trade compliance and economic sanctions and similar laws and to implement policies and procedures designed to ensure that its employees and other intermediaries comply with the applicable restrictions these restrictions include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products services and any other economic resources to embargoed or sanctioned countries governments persons and entities compliance with these restrictions requires among other things screening of business partners despite its commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics the company cannot ensure that its policies and procedures will always protect it from intentional reckless or negligent acts committed by employees or agents under the applicable laws if linde fails to comply with laws governing the conduct of international operations linde may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures which could materially adversely affect its reputation business and results of operations 

the outcome of litigation or governmental investigations may adversely impact the company’s business or results of operations 

linde’s subsidiaries are party to various lawsuits and governmental investigations arising in the ordinary course of business adverse outcomes in some or all of the claims pending may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect linde’s ability to conduct business linde and its subsidiaries may in the future become subject to further claims and litigation which is impossible to predict the litigation and other claims linde faces are subject to inherent uncertainties legal or regulatory judgments or agreed settlements might give rise to expenses which are not covered or are not fully covered by insurance benefits and may also lead to negative publicity and reputational damage an unfavorable outcome or determination could cause a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations 

potential product defects or inadequate customer care may adversely impact linde’s business or results of operations 

risks associated with products and services may result in potential liability claims the loss of customers or damage to linde’s reputation principal possible causes of risks associated with products and services are product defects or an inadequate level of customer care when linde is providing services 

linde is exposed to legal risks relating to product liability in the countries where it operates including countries such as the united states where legal risks in particular through class actions have historically been more significant than in other countries the outcome of any pending or future products and services proceedings or investigations cannot be predicted and legal or regulatory judgments or agreed settlements may give rise to significant losses costs and expenses 

the manufacturing and sale of products as well as the construction of plants by linde may give rise to risks associated with the production filling storage handling and transport of raw materials goods or waste industrial gases are 

potentially hazardous substances and medical gases and the related healthcare services must comply with the relevant specifications in order to not adversely affect the health of patients treated with them 

linde’s products and services if defective or not handled or performed appropriately may lead to personal injuries business interruptions environmental damages or other significant damages which may result among other consequences in liability losses monetary penalties or compensation payments environmental cleanup costs or other costs and expenses exclusion from certain market sectors deemed important for future development of the business and loss of reputation all these consequences could have a material adverse effect on linde’s business and results of operations 

us civil liabilities may not be enforceable against linde 

linde is organized under the laws of ireland and substantial portions of its assets will be located outside of the united states in addition certain directors and officers of linde and its subsidiaries reside outside the united states as a result it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the united states upon linde or such persons or to enforce outside the united states judgments obtained against such persons in us courts in any action including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws in addition it may be difficult for investors to enforce in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the united states rights predicated upon the us federal securities laws 

a judgment for the payment of money rendered by a court in the united states based on civil liability would not be automatically enforceable in ireland there is no treaty between ireland and the united states providing for the reciprocal enforcement of foreign judgments the following requirements must be met before the foreign judgment will be deemed to be enforceable in ireland i the judgment must be for a definite sum ii the judgment must be final and conclusive and iii the judgment must be provided by a court of competent jurisdiction 

an irish court will also exercise its right to refuse judgment if the foreign judgment i was obtained by fraud ii violated irish public policy iii is in breach of natural justice or iv if the judgment is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment 

in addition there is doubt as to whether an irish court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability on linde or such persons in an original action predicated solely upon the us federal securities laws brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in ireland against linde or such member officer or expert respectively 

changes in tax laws or policy could adversely impact the company’s financial position or results of operations 

linde and its subsidiaries are subject to the tax rules and regulations in the us germany ireland the uk and other countries in which they operate those tax rules and regulations are subject to change on a prospective or retroactive basis under current economic and political conditions including the uk’s ongoing exit process from the eu tax rates and policies in any jurisdiction including the us the uk and the eu are subject to significant change in particular since linde is currently treated as uk tax resident any potential changes in the tax rules applying to uk taxresident companies would directly affect linde 

a change in linde’s tax residency could have a negative effect on the company’s future profitability and may trigger taxes on dividends or exit charges if linde ceases to be resident in the united kingdom and becomes resident in another jurisdiction it may be subject to united kingdom exit charges andor could become liable for additional tax charges in the other jurisdiction if linde were to be treated as resident in more than one jurisdiction it could be subject to duplicative taxation furthermore although linde is incorporated in ireland and is not expected to be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes it is possible that the irs could disagree with this result or that changes in us federal income tax law could alter this result if the irs successfully asserted such a position or the law were to change significant adverse tax consequences may result for linde the company and linde’s shareholders 

when tax rules change this may result in a higher tax expense and the need to make higher tax payments in addition changes in tax legislation may have a significant impact on linde’s and its subsidiaries’ tax receivables and tax liabilities as well as on their deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and uncertainty about the tax environment in some regions may restrict their opportunities to enforce their respective rights under the law linde also operates in countries with complex tax regulations which could be interpreted in different ways interpretations of these regulations or changes in the tax system might have an adverse impact on the tax liabilities profitability and business operations of 

linde linde and its subsidiaries are subject to periodic audits by the tax authorities in various jurisdictions or other review actions by the relevant financial or tax authorities the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in linde’s or its subsidiaries’ financial statements and may materially affect their respective financial results for the period when such determination is made

items affecting comparability 

because praxair and linde ag combined their respective businesses effective with the merger date of october 31 2018 the year ended december 31 2019 reflects the results and cash flows of the combined business while the year ended december 31 2018 includes twelve months of praxair and two months of linde ag due to the size of linde ag’s businesses prior to the merger the reported results for 2019 and 2018 periods are not comparable the balance sheets at december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 are comparable because both periods reflect the merger

related party transactions 

the company’s related parties are primarily unconsolidated equity affiliates the company did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated with independent parties 

environmental matters 

linde’s principal operations relate to the production and distribution of atmospheric and other industrial gases which historically have not had a significant impact on the environment however worldwide costs relating to environmental 

protection may continue to grow due to increasingly stringent laws and regulations and lindes ongoing commitment to rigorous internal standards in addition linde may face physical risks from climate change and extreme weather 

climate change 

linde operates in jurisdictions that have or are developing laws andor regulations to reduce or mitigate the perceived adverse effects of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and faces a highly uncertain regulatory environment in this area for example the us environmental protection agency epa has promulgated rules requiring reporting of ghg emissions and linde and many of its suppliers and customers are subject to these rules epa has also promulgated regulations to restrict ghg emissions including final rules regulating ghg emissions from lightduty vehicles and certain large manufacturing facilities many of which are linde suppliers or customers in addition to these developments in the united states ghgs are regulated in the european union under the emissions trading system which has wide implications for the companys customers and may impact certain operations of linde in europe there are also requirements for mandatory reporting in canada which apply to certain linde operations and will be used in developing capandtrade regulations on ghg emissions these regulations are expected to impact certain linde facilities in canada climate change and energy efficiency laws and policies are also being widely introduced in jurisdictions throughout latin america and parts of asia china has announced plans to implement its national carbon emissions trading system in 2020 though it does not appear the regulations will have a direct impact on ghg emissions from linde facilities among other impacts such regulations are expected to raise the cost of energy which is a significant cost for linde nevertheless lindes longterm customer contracts routinely provide rights to recover increased electricity natural gas and other costs that are incurred by the company as a result of climate change regulation 

linde anticipates continued growth in its hydrogen business as hydrogen is essential to refineries that use it to remove sulfur from transportation fuels in order to meet ambient air quality standards in the united states and fuel standards in other regions hydrogen production plants and a large number of other manufacturing and electricitygenerating plants have been identified in california and the european union as a source of carbon dioxide emissions and these plants are subject to capandtrade regulations in those jurisdictions linde believes it will be able to mitigate the costs of these regulations through the terms of its product supply contracts however legislation that limits ghg emissions may impact growth by increasing capital compliance operating and maintenance costs andor decreasing demand 

to manage business risks from current and potential ghg emission regulation as well as physical consequences of climate change linde actively monitors current developments evaluates the direct and indirect business risks and takes appropriate actions among others actions include increasing relevant resources and training maintaining contingency plans obtaining advice and counsel from expert vendors insurance providers and industry experts incorporating ghg provisions in commercial agreements and conducting regular reviews of the business risks with management although there are considerable uncertainties linde believes that the business risk from potential regulations can be effectively managed through its commercial contracts additionally linde does not anticipate any material effects regarding its plant operations or business arising from potential physical risks of climate change 

linde continuously seeks opportunities to optimize energy use and ghg footprint through research and development in customer applications and rigorous operational energy efficiency investment in renewable energy and purchasing hydrogen as a chemical byproduct where feasible linde maintains related performance improvement targets and reports progress against these targets regularly to business management and annually to lindes board of directors 

at the same time linde may benefit from business opportunities arising from governmental regulation of ghg and other emissions uncertain costs of energy and certain natural resources the development of renewable energy alternatives and new technologies that help extract natural gas improve air quality increase energy efficiency and mitigate the impacts of climate change linde continues to develop new applications that can lower emissions including ghg emissions in lindes processes and help customers lower energy consumption and increase product throughput stricter regulation of water quality in emerging economies such as china provide a growing market for a number of gases eg oxygen for wastewater treatment increased concern about drought in areas such as california and australia may create additional markets for carbon dioxide for desalination renewable fuel standards in the european union and us create a market for secondgeneration biofuels which use industrial gases such as oxygen carbon dioxide and hydrogen 

costs relating to the protection of the environment 

environmental protection costs in 2019 were not significant linde anticipates that future annual environmental protection expenditures will be similar to 2019  subject to any significant changes in existing laws and regulations based

retirement benefits 

pensions 

the net periodic benefit cost for the us and international pension plans was 107 million in 2019  24 million in 2018 and 58 million in 2017  the net periodic pension cost for 2019 includes pension settlement charges of 97 million related to lump sum payments which were triggered by either a change in control provision or mergerrelated divestitures and a net curtailment charge of 8 million for termination benefits primarily in connection with a defined benefit pension plan freeze settlement charges for 2018 and 2017 were 14 million and 2 million  respectively 

the funded status pension benefit obligation pbo less the fair value of plan assets for the us plans was a deficit of 504 million as of december 31 2019 and a deficit of 556 million at december 31 2018  the funded status for international plans was a deficit of 1801 million as of december 31 2019 and a deficit of 1241 million at december 31 2018 in the us the benefit from the actual return on assets more than offset the impacts of unfavorable liability experience resulting from the low discount rate environment for the international plans the unfavorable impact of lower discount rates outweighed favorable plan asset experience 

global pension contributions were  94 million in 2019   87 million in 2018 and  19 million in 2017  at a minimum linde contributes to its pension plans to comply with local regulatory requirements eg erisa in the united states discretionary contributions in excess of the local minimum requirements are made based on many factors including longterm projections of the plans funded status the economic environment potential risk of overfunding pension insurance costs and alternative uses of cash changes to these factors can impact the timing of discretionary contributions from year to year estimated required contributions for 2020 are currently expected to be in the range of 50 million to 80 million 

linde assumes expected returns on plan assets for 2020 of 700 and 531 for the us and international plans respectively which are consistent with the longterm expected returns on its investment portfolios 

excluding the impact of any settlements 2020 consolidated pension expense is expected to be a benefit of approximately 45 million the benefit derived from the expected return on assets assumption for lindes most significant plans is anticipated to more than offset the expense from service and interest cost accruals and the amortization of deferred losses 

refer to the critical accounting policies section and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the company’s retirement benefits including a description of the various retirement plans and the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost and funded status 

insurance 

linde purchases insurance to limit a variety of property and casualty risks including those related to property business interruption thirdparty liability and workers’ compensation currently the company self retains up to 10 million per occurrence for vehicle liability in the united states 5 million per occurrence for workers compensation and general liability in addition the company self retains risk up to 5 million at its various properties worldwide for property damage resulting from fire flood and other perils effecting its properties along with a separate 5 million deductible on all business interruption resulting from a major peril loss to mitigate its aggregate loss potential above these retentions the company purchases catastrophic insurance coverage from highly rated insurance companies the company does not currently operate or participate in any captive insurance companies or other nontraditional risk transfer alternatives 

at december 31 2019 and 2018  the company had recorded a total of 66 million and 60 million respectively representing an estimate of the retained liability for the ultimate cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet dates the estimated liability is established using statistical analysis and is based upon historical experience actuarial assumptions and professional judgment these estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency and are subject to a significant degree of inherent variability if actual claims differ from the company’s estimates they will be adjusted at that time and financial results could be impacted 

linde recognizes estimated insurance proceeds relating to damages at the time of loss only to the extent of incurred losses any insurance recoveries for business interruption and for property damages in excess of the net book value of the property are recognized only when realized or pending payments confirmed by its insurance companies 

segment discussion 

effective october 31 2018 praxair and linde ag completed the previously announced merger resulting in the formation of linde plc see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the merger as a result of the merger and effective with the lifting of the hold separate order effective on march 1 2019 new operating segments were created which are used by the companys chief operating decision maker codm to allocate company resources and assess performance linde’s operations consist of two major product lines industrial gases and engineering as further described in the following paragraph linde’s industrial gases operations are managed on a geographic basis which represents three of the companys new reportable segments  americas emea europemiddle eastafrica and apac asiasouth pacific a fourth reportable segment which represents the companys engineering business designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications specifically for end customers and is managed on a worldwide basis operating in all geographic segments other consists of corporate costs and a few smaller businesses which individually do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation 

the industrial gases product line centers on the manufacturing and distribution of atmospheric gases oxygen nitrogen argon rare gases and process gases carbon dioxide helium hydrogen electronic gases specialty gases acetylene many of these products are coproducts of the same manufacturing process linde manufactures and distributes nearly all of its products and manages its customer relationships on a regional basis linde’s industrial gases are distributed to various endmarkets within a regional segment through one of three basic distribution methods onsite or tonnage merchant or bulk and packaged or cylinder gases the distribution methods are generally integrated in order to best meet the customer’s needs and very few of its products can be economically transported outside of a region therefore the distribution economics are specific to the various geographies in which the company operates and are consistent with how management assesses performance 

the company’s measure of profitloss for segment reporting purposes remains unchanged  segment operating profit segment operating profit is defined as operating profit excluding purchase accounting impacts of the linde ag merger intercompany royalties and items not indicative of ongoing business trends this is the manner in which the company’s codm assesses performance and allocates resources for a description of lindes previous operating segments refer to note 20 to the consolidated financial statements of lindes 2018 annual report on form 10k

the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding linde’s financial statements and accompanying notes prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap their application places significant importance on management’s judgment as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain linde’s financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected if actual results differ from estimates made these policies are determined by management and have been reviewed by linde’s audit committee 

purchase accounting 

linde ag’s assets and liabilities were measured at fair value as of the date of the merger estimates of fair value represent managements best estimate of assumptions about future events and uncertainties in determining the fair value linde utilized various forms of the income cost and market approaches depending on the asset or liability being fair valued the estimation of fair value includes significant judgments related to future cash flows sales costs customer attrition rates and contributory asset charges discount rates competitive trends market comparables and others inputs were generally obtained from historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions and growth rates the estimates and assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets and liabilities as well as asset lives have a material impact to the companys consolidated financial statements and are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain as of the end of 2019 the valuation process to determine the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities is complete

property plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over the assets’ estimated useful lives on a straightline basis for financial reporting purposes the estimated useful life represents the projected period of time that the asset will be productively employed by the company and is determined by management based on many factors including historical experience with similar assets technological life cycles geographic locations and contractual supply relationships with onsite customers circumstances and events relating to these assets such as onsite contract modifications are monitored to ensure that changes in asset lives or impairments see “asset impairments” are identified and prospective depreciation expense or impairment expense is adjusted accordingly linde’s largest asset values relate to cryogenic airseparation production plants with depreciable lives of principally 15 years 

based upon the assets as of december 31 2019  if depreciable lives of machinery and equipment on average were increased or decreased by one year annual depreciation expense would be decreased by approximately 471 million or increased by approximately 618 million  respectively

amortization of other intangible assets 

linde’s net other intangible assets at december 31 2019 was 16137 million  representing 19 of the company’s consolidated total assets including 1870 million of indefinitelived intangibles amortization expense related to finitelived intangible assets for the year ended december 31 2019 was 735 million  or 3 of total operating costs management judgment is required in the determination of the estimated amortizable lives that are used to calculate the annual amortization expense and accumulated amortization see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

based upon the assets as of december 31 2019  if amortization lives of other intangible assets on average were increased or decreased by one year annual amortization expense would be decreased by approximately 33 million or increased by approximately 36 million  respectively

revenue recognition 

longterm construction contracts 

the company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other varied gas production and processing plants manufactured specifically for end customers revenue from sale of equipment is generally recognized over time as linde has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance does not create an asset with alternative use for contracts recognized over time revenue is recognized primarily using a cost incurred input method costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations costs incurred include material labor and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer contract modifications are typically accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inceptiontodate effect of such change we assess performance as progress towards completion is achieved on specific projects earnings will be impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects 

pension benefits 

pension benefits represent financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments significant estimates are required to calculate pension expense and liabilities related to the company’s plans the company utilizes the services of independent actuaries whose models are used to facilitate these calculations 

several key assumptions are used in actuarial models to calculate pension expense and liability amounts recorded in the financial statements management believes the three most significant variables in the models are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate and the expected rate of compensation increase the actuarial models also use assumptions for various other factors including employee turnover retirement age and mortality linde management believes the assumptions used in the actuarial calculations are reasonable reflect the company’s experience and expectations for the future and are within accepted practices in each of the respective geographic locations in which it operates actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors the sensitivities to each of the key assumptions presented below exclude the impact of special items that occurred during the year eg divestiturerelated settlement charges settlement charges resulting from change in control provisions etc 

the weightedaverage expected longterm rates of return on pension plan assets were 727 for us plans and 515 for international plans for the year ended december 31 2019  762 and 513  respectively at december 31 2018  the expected longterm rate of return on the us and international plan assets is estimated based on the plans investment strategy and asset allocation historical capital market performance and to a lesser extent historical plan performance a 050 change in these expected longterm rates of return with all other variables held constant would change linde’s pension expense by approximately 44 million 

the company has consistently used a marketrelated value of assets rather than the fair value at the measurement date to determine annual pension expense the marketrelated value recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period as a result changes in the fair value of assets from year to year are not immediately reflected in the company’s annual pension expense instead annual pension expense in future periods will be impacted as deferred investment gains or losses are recognized in the marketrelated value of assets over the fiveyear period the consolidated marketrelated value of assets was 8778 million or 158 million lower than the fair value of assets of 8936 million at december 31 2019  these net deferred investment losses of 158 million will be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of assets ratably over the next four years and will impact future pension expense future actual investment gains or losses will impact the marketrelated value of assets and therefore will impact future annual pension expense in a similar manner 

discount rates are used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities and pension costs and are determined annually by management the company measures the service and interest cost components of pension and opeb expense for significant us and international plans using the spot rate approach us plans that do not use the spot rate approach continue to determine discount rates by using a cash flow matching model provided by the companys independent actuaries the model includes a portfolio of corporate bonds graded aa or better by at least half of the ratings agencies and matches the us plans projected cash flows to the calculated spot rates discount rates for the remaining international plans are based on market yields for highquality fixed income investments representing the approximate duration of the pension liabilities on the measurement 

date refer to note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the discount rates used to calculate plan liabilities and benefit costs and to the retirement benefits section of the consolidated results and other information section of this mda for a further discussion of 2019 benefit costs a 050 reduction in discount rates with all other variables held constant would increase linde’s pension expense by approximately 29 million whereas a 050 increase in discount rates would result in a decrease of 25 million a 050 reduction in discount rates would increase the pbo by approximately 976 million whereas a 050 increase in discount rates would have a favorable impact to the pbo of approximately 855 million 

the weightedaverage expected rate of compensation increase was 325 for us plans and 246 for international plans at december 31 2019  325 and 238  respectively at december 31 2018  the estimated annual compensation increase is determined by management every year and is based on historical trends and market indices a 050 change in the expected rate of compensation increase with all other variables held constant would change linde’s pension expense by approximately 8 million and would impact the pbo by approximately 65 million 

asset impairments 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles assets 

at december 31 2019  the company had goodwill of 27019 million and 1870 million of other indefinitelived intangible assets goodwill represents the aggregate of the excess consideration paid for acquired businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired indefinitelived other intangibles relate to the linde name 

the company performs a goodwill impairment test annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 the company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment test from april 30 to october 1 the change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with the company’s planning process the change in annual impairment testing date did not delay accelerate or avoid an impairment charge the company has determined this change in the method of applying an accounting principle is preferable 

the impairment tests performed during the second and fourth quarters of 2019 indicated no impairment at december 31 2019  linde’s enterprise value was approximately 125 billion outstanding shares multiplied by the yearend stock price plus net debt and without any control premium while its total capital was approximately 63 billion  

the impairment test allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value then the company will estimate and compare the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying value including goodwill reporting units are determined based on one level below the operating segment level in estimating the fair value of each reporting unit management applied a multiple of earnings from a peer group to the company’s forecasted earnings for the year ending december 31 2019 the peer group is comprised of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics 

such analysis requires the use of certain market assumptions and discount factors which are subjective in nature as applicable estimated values can be affected by many factors beyond the companys control such as business and economic trends government regulation and technological changes management believes that the quantitative and qualitative factors used to perform its annual goodwill impairment assessment are appropriate and reasonable although the 2019 assessment indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value changes in circumstances or conditions affecting this analysis could have a significant impact on the fair value determination which could then result in a material impairment charge to the companys results of operations reporting units with greater concentration of linde ag assets fair valued during the recent merger are at greater risk of impairment in future periods 

other indefinitelived intangible assets from linde ag recently fair valued are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred and no impairments were indicated 

see notes 3 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

longlived assets 

longlived assets including property plant and equipment and finitelived other intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an individual asset or asset group may not be recoverable for purposes of this test asset groups are determined based upon the lowest level for which 

there are independent and identifiable cash flows based upon lindes business model for property plant and equipment an asset group may be a single plant and related assets used to support onsite merchant and packaged gas customers alternatively the asset group may be a pipeline complex which includes multiple interdependent plants and related assets connected by pipelines within a geographic area used to support the same distribution methods 

income taxes 

at december 31 2019  linde had deferred tax assets of 2179 million net of valuation allowances of 222 million  and deferred tax liabilities of 8825 million  at december 31 2019  uncertain tax positions totaled 472 million see notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements income tax expense was 769 million for the year ended december 31 2019  or about 263 of pretax income see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to taxes 

in the preparation of consolidated financial statements linde estimates income taxes based on diverse legislative and regulatory structures that exist in various jurisdictions where the company conducts business deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent tax benefits or obligations that arise from temporary differences due to differing treatment of certain items for accounting and income tax purposes linde evaluates deferred tax assets each period to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character eg capital gain versus ordinary income treatment amount and timing to result in their recovery a valuation allowance is established when management determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized to reduce the assets to their realizable value considerable judgments are required in establishing deferred tax valuation allowances and in assessing exposures related to tax matters as events and circumstances change related reserves and valuation allowances are adjusted to income at that time linde’s tax returns are subject to audit and local taxing authorities could challenge the company’s tax positions the company’s practice is to review tax filing positions by jurisdiction and to record provisions for uncertain income tax positions including interest and penalties when applicable linde believes it records andor discloses such potential tax liabilities as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its income tax liabilities and recoverable tax assets if new information becomes available adjustments are charged or credited against income at that time management does not anticipate that such adjustments would have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s reported results of operations 

contingencies 

the company accrues liabilities for nonincome tax contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated while contingent gains are recognized only when realized or realizable if new information becomes available or losses are sustained in excess of recorded amounts adjustments are charged against income at that time management does not anticipate that in the aggregate such losses would have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the company’s reported results of operations 

linde is subject to various claims legal proceedings and government investigations that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business these actions are based upon alleged environmental tax antitrust and personal injury claims among others see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements such contingencies are significant and the accounting requires considerable management judgments in analyzing each matter to assess the likely outcome and the need for establishing appropriate liabilities and providing adequate disclosures linde believes it records andor discloses such contingencies as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its liabilities 

new accounting standards 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning new accounting standards and the impact of the implementation of these standards on the company’s financial statements

linde does not expect changes in the aggregate fair value of its financial assets and liabilities to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

linde is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates the objective of financial risk management at linde is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company’s earnings cash flows and equity 

to manage these risks linde uses various derivative financial instruments including interestrate swaps treasury rate locks currency swaps forward contracts and commodity contracts linde only uses commonly traded and nonleveraged instruments these contracts are entered into primarily with major banking institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss also see notes 2 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of linde’s accounting policies and use of such instruments 

the following discussion presents the sensitivity of the market value earnings and cash flows of linde’s financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest and exchange rates assuming these changes occurred at december 31 2019  the range of changes chosen for these discussions reflects linde’s view of changes which are reasonably possible over a oneyear period market values represent the present values of projected future cash flows based on interest rate and exchange rate assumptions 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2019  linde had debt totaling 13956 million  15296 million at december 31 2018  for fixedrate instruments interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows conversely for floatingrate instruments interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of the instrument but impact future earnings and cash flows assuming that other factors are held constant at december 31 2019  including the impact of derivatives linde had fixedrate debt of 10799 million and floatingrate debt of 3157 million  representing 77 and 23 respectively of total debt at december 31 2018  linde had fixedrate debt of 12565 million and floatingrate debt of 2731 million representing 82 and 18 respectively of total debt 

fixed rate debt 

in order to mitigate interest rate risk when considered appropriate interestrate swaps are entered into as hedges of underlying financial instruments to effectively change the characteristics of the interest rate without actually changing the underlying financial instrument at december 31 2019  linde had fixedtofloating interest rate swaps outstanding that were designated as hedging instruments of the underlying debt issuances  refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information this sensitivity analysis assumes that holding all other variables constant such as foreign exchange rates swaps and debt levels a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the unrealized fair market value of the fixedrate debt portfolio by approximately 473 million 594 million in 2018  a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate 73 million increase to derivative assets recorded 

variable rate debt 

at december 31 2019  the aftertax earnings and cash flows impact of a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates including offsetting impact of derivatives on the variablerate debt portfolio would be approximately 48 million 24 million in 2018 

foreign currency risk 

linde’s exchangerate exposures result primarily from its investments and ongoing operations in latin america primarily brazil chile and colombia europe primarily germany scandinavia and the united kingdom canada mexico asia pacific primarily australia china and other business transactions such as the procurement of equipment from foreign sources linde frequently utilizes currency contracts to hedge these exposures at december 31 2019  linde had a notional amount outstanding of 9713 million 9412 million at december 31 2018  related to foreign exchange contracts the majority of these were to hedge recorded balance sheet exposures primarily intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

holding all other variables constant if there were a 10 increase in foreigncurrency exchange rates for the portfolio the fair market value of foreigncurrency contracts outstanding at december 31 2019 would increase by approximately 194 million and at december 31 2018 would decrease by approximately 307 million which would be largely offset by an offsetting loss or gain on the foreigncurrency fluctuation of the underlying exposure being hedged

 item 1 business 

linde plc formerly known as zamalight plc   linde plc or the “company” was incorporated as a public limited company under the laws of ireland on april 18 2017 by enceladus holding limited enceladus and cumberland corporate services limited cumberland zamalight plc was renamed linde plc on july 20 2017 the company is registered in ireland under the registration number 602527 and with its registered office located at ten earlsfort terrace dublin 2 d02 t380 ireland and principal executive offices at the priestley centre 10 priestley road the surrey research park guildford surrey gu2 7xy united kingdom the company’s fiscal year ended on december 31 2017

 item 1a risk factors 

to date the company has not conducted any material activities other than those incidental to its formation and the matters contemplated by the business combination agreement important risk factors that could impact linde plc’s future operations financial performance and the trading prices of its common shares are presented below the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with discussions of linde plc’s activities located elsewhere in this form 10k and the risk factors including risks related to praxair’s and linde’s businesses included or incorporated by reference into linde plc’s subsequent filings with the sec 

linde plc praxair and linde must obtain governmental and regulatory approvals to consummate the business combination which could delay the completion of the business combination or if not granted would result in a termination of the business combination in addition conditions imposed by such agencies in connection with their approvals may adversely impact the business financial condition or results of operations of the combined group 

completion of the business combination remains conditioned upon regulatory approval or expiration or termination of 

statutory waiting periods including extensions thereof under merger control or competition law regimes in the united states including cfius approval the european union brazil canada china india mexico and south korea in addition regulatory approvals have been solicited and filings made in other jurisdictions in which the parties mutually agreed antitrust filings to be necessary the relevant agencies have commenced or may commence indepth investigations may impose requirements limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of linde plc’s praxair’s and linde ag’s respective businesses for example on february 16 2018 the european commission initiated a phase ii review of the proposed business combination and on august 31 2017 praxair inc and linde ag entered into timing agreements with the united states federal trade commission the “ftc” in accordance with such timing agreements the proposed business combination will not close before 1201 am eastern time on the 120th calendar day following the date on which praxair and linde ag provide written notice to the ftc of their intention to close unless they have received prior notice that the ftc has closed its investigation while timing agreements with the ftc and a phase ii review by the european commission are customary in large transactions of this nature and the companies are continuing to work closely and cooperatively with regulators any delay for regulatory reasons could diminish the anticipated benefits of the business combination or result in additional transaction costs no assurance can be given that the required approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to the business combination will be satisfied and if they are as to the terms conditions and timing of the approvals if the requisite regulatory approvals have not been obtained by october 24 2018 the business combination agreement will terminate 

conditions imposed by regulatory agencies in connection with their approval of the business combination may require changes to the operations of linde plc praxair andor linde restrict their ability to operate in certain jurisdictions following the business combination restrict the combination of praxair’s and linde’s operations in certain jurisdictions or require other commitments regarding ongoing operations such conditions may also restrict linde plc’s praxair’s andor linde’s ability to modify the operations of their businesses in response to changing circumstances for a period of time after completion of the business combination or their ability to expend cash for other uses or otherwise have an adverse effect on the anticipated benefits of the business combination thereby adversely impacting the business financial condition or results of operations of linde plc praxair and linde the companies currently expect to divest certain assets in order to obtain certain regulatory approvals which may result in loss of value due to the loss of those assets or businesses or a sale of those assets or businesses at less than the desired price or under otherwise unfavorable conditions in particular as a result of timing constraints and the limited universe of buyers acceptable to the regulatory authorities especially in challenging market conditions the business combination agreement contemplates certain revenue and ebitda thresholds with respect to such potential divestitures the companies may also make certain other commitments regarding ongoing operations in certain jurisdictions in response to regulatory requirements linde plc praxair and linde may not be successful in obtaining all required regulatory approvals and if they are any restrictions requirements or conditions imposed by regulators could have a material adverse effect on the business results of operations financial condition and prospects of linde plc and reduce substantially or eliminate the synergies and cost reductions and the advantages which linde plc praxair and linde expect to achieve from the business combination 

in addition the business combination agreement or certain covenants therein may be terminated for or may terminate as a result of certain reasons including among others a permanent injunction or order by any governmental entity in ireland the united kingdom germany or the united states that prohibits or makes illegal the completion of the business combination the occurrence of a change event occurrence or effect that has had or is reasonably expected to have a “material adverse change” as defined in the business combination agreement on linde ag or praxair inc or the failure to obtain approval by requisite governmental regulators and authorities described in the preceding paragraph no assurance can be given that no event giving rise to termination of the business combination agreement will occur 

because the exchange ratios in the merger and the exchange offer are fixed the market value of the linde plc shares received by praxair shareholders in the merger or by linde ag shareholders in the exchange offer may be less than the market value of the praxair or linde ag shares that such holder held prior to the completion of the business combination 

praxair shareholders will receive one linde plc share for each of their praxair shares in the merger and linde ag shareholders who tendered their linde ag shares in the exchange offer will receive 1540 linde plc shares for each linde ag share tendered and not withdrawn these exchange ratios are fixed and will not vary even if the market price of praxair shares or linde ag shares varies the market value of praxair shares and linde ag shares at the time of the completion of the business combination may vary significantly from the value on the date of the execution of the business combination agreement the date of this document the date on which praxair shareholders voted on the merger the date on which linde ag shareholders tendered their shares in the exchange offer or the expiration of the acceptance period because the exchange ratios will not be adjusted to reflect any changes in the market price of the praxair shares or linde ag shares the value of the consideration paid to the praxair shareholders in the merger or to the linde ag shareholders who tendered their shares in the exchange offer may be lower than the market value of their praxair or linde ag shares respectively on earlier dates 

changes in share prices may result from a variety of factors that are beyond the control of linde plc praxair and linde including their respective business operations and prospects market conditions economic development geopolitical events regulatory considerations governmental actions legal proceedings and other developments market assessments of the benefits of the business combination and of the likelihood that the business combination will be completed as well as general and industryspecific market and economic conditions may also have an adverse effect on share prices 

the pendency of the business combination during which praxair and linde are subject to certain operating restrictions could have an adverse effect on linde plc’s praxair’s and linde’s businesses and cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

the pendency of the business combination could disrupt praxair’s and linde’s businesses and uncertainty about the effect of the business combination may have an adverse effect on linde plc praxair and linde these uncertainties could cause suppliers vendors partners customers and others that deal with praxair and linde to defer entering into contracts with or making other decisions concerning praxair and linde or to seek to change or cancel existing business relationships with the companies in addition praxair’s and linde’s employees may experience uncertainty regarding their roles after the business combination employees may depart either before or after the completion of the business combination because of uncertainty and issues relating to the difficulty of coordination or because of a desire not to remain following the business combination therefore the pendency of the business combination may adversely affect linde plc’s praxair’s and linde’s ability to retain recruit and motivate key personnel additionally the attention of praxair’s and linde’s management may be directed towards the completion of the business combination including obtaining regulatory approvals and may be diverted from the daytoday business operations of praxair and linde matters related to the business combination may require commitments of time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that might have been beneficial to praxair and linde additionally the business combination agreement requires praxair and linde to refrain from taking certain specified actions for example significant investments or disposals while the business combination is pending except those necessary in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals these restrictions may prevent praxair and linde from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities or capital structure alternatives and from executing certain business strategies prior to the completion of the business combination further the business combination may give rise to potential liabilities including those that may result from pending and future shareholder lawsuits relating to the business combination or a postcompletion reorganization any of these matters could adversely affect the businesses of or harm the results of operations financial condition or cash flows of linde plc praxair and linde 

further certain adverse changes in the business of linde or praxair in the period prior to the closing of the business combination may occur that would not result in praxair linde or linde plc having the right to terminate the business combination agreement or certain covenants therein if adverse changes occur but praxair and linde are still required to complete the business combination the market value of praxair shares linde ag shares or linde plc shares may decrease if the business combination is not completed these risks may still materialize and materially adversely affect the business and financial results of linde plc 

negative publicity related to the business combination may materially adversely affect linde plc praxair and linde 

from time to time political and public sentiment in connection with a business combination may result in a significant amount of adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting the parties to the business combination adverse press coverage and public statements whether or not driven by political or popular sentiment may also result in legal claims or in investigations by regulators legislators and law enforcement officials responding to these investigations and lawsuits regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceedings can divert the time and effort of senior management from operating their businesses addressing any adverse publicity governmental scrutiny or enforcement or other legal proceedings could be timeconsuming and expensive and regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made could have a negative impact on the reputation of linde plc praxair and linde on the morale and performance of their employees and on their relationships with regulators suppliers and customers it may also have a negative impact on their ability to take timely advantage of various business and market opportunities the direct and indirect effects of negative publicity and the demands of responding to and addressing it may have a material adverse effect on linde plc’s praxair’s and linde’s respective business and cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

upon completion of the business combination certain changeofcontrol rights under material agreements may be triggered 

praxair and linde are parties to agreements that contain changeofcontrol provisions that may be triggered upon completion of the business combination upon the triggering of these changeofcontrol provisions the counterparties to the agreement may be able to exercise certain rights that have a negative effect on praxair linde or after the business combination 

linde plc for example the terms of linde’s approximately €85 billion notes outstanding include change of control clauses triggered by a change of control of linde ag and a resulting below investment grade ratings downgrade of linde ag’s corporate and debt ratings in addition linde’s €25 billion undrawn syndicated credit facility and praxair’s 25 billion credit facility each include a change of control clause relating to a change of control of linde ag and praxair inc respectively if parties to agreements with changeofcontrol provisions exercise such rights contracts that are beneficial to linde or praxair may be terminated which may have an adverse effect on the business the cash flows and the financial condition and results of operations of linde plc praxair and linde 

the business combination triggered a mandatory takeover offer with respect to linde’s listed local subsidiary in india and may require such mandatory takeover offers in other jurisdictions 

the completion of the business combination will result in linde plc acquiring indirect control of linde’s subsidiaries listed on local stock exchanges should relevant conditions under local laws of individual jurisdictions be met and if an exemption is not available or granted under the respective regulations the business combination may trigger the obligation to make a public offer with respect to the outstanding shares in certain of linde’s subsidiaries that are publicly listed to the extent that linde plc is unable to obtain any applicable exemption potentially costly and complex takeover procedures may have to be conducted in addition the granting of any applicable exemption may depend on the discretion of the competent authority and may also depend on the competent authority’s interpretation of the applicable laws and regulations including the need for any application for any such exemption no assurance can be provided that the respective competent authorities will grant the requested exemptions or will confirm that no mandatory takeover offers with respect to any such listed subsidiaries will be required as a result of the transaction even if such authority may have granted exemptions for similar transactions in the past accordingly the business combination will require such a mandatory takeover offer in india subject to and following the completion of the business combination and may require such mandatory takeover offers in other jurisdictions which would result in additional transaction costs and complexity 

praxair and linde have incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction fees and costs in connection with the business combination 

praxair and linde expect to continue to incur a number of significant nonrecurring implementation and restructuring costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies in addition praxair and linde will incur significant banking legal accounting and other transaction fees and costs related to the business combination additional costs substantially in excess of currently anticipated costs may also be incurred in connection with the integration of the businesses of praxair and linde 

any cost savings or other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses that could offset these transaction and combinationrelated costs over time may not be achieved in the near term or at all in addition the timeline in which cost savings are expected to be realized is lengthy and may not be achieved failure to realize these synergies and cost reductions and other efficiencies in a timely manner or at all could have a material adverse effect on linde plc’s praxair’s and linde’s respective businesses and cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

linde plc may fail to realize the anticipated strategic and financial benefits sought from the business combination 

linde plc may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the business combination the success of the business combination will depend on among other things linde plc’s ability to combine praxair’s business with linde’s business in a manner that facilitates growth and realizes anticipated cost savings in addition the actual integration of praxair and linde will involve complex operational technological and personnelrelated challenges this process will be timeconsuming and expensive and it may be disruptive to the combined businesses linde plc may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the business combination difficulties in the integration of the businesses which may result in significant costs and delays include 



 

these and other factors could result in increased costs and diversion of management’s time and energy as well as decreases in the amount of expected revenue and earnings which could materially impact linde plc’s business financial condition and results of operations the integration process and other disruptions resulting from the business combination may also adversely affect linde plc’s relationships with employees suppliers customers distributors licensors and others with whom praxair and linde have business or other dealings and difficulties in integrating the businesses of praxair and linde could harm the reputation of the combined group 

if the combined group is not able to successfully combine the businesses of praxair and linde in an efficient costeffective and timely manner the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the business combination may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

linde plc intends to implement certain postclosing reorganization transactions with respect to linde ag if the effectiveness of such transactions is delayed as a result of litigation or otherwise or does not occur this may have an adverse effect on the ability to realize synergies and cost reductions and on the market value of linde plc shares 

following completion of the business combination linde ag will be an indirect subsidiary of linde plc and thus a dependent company within the meaning of section 17 of the german stock corporation act the legal framework for this dependency between linde plc and linde ag is subject to other applicable law set forth in sections 311 et seq  of the german stock corporation act which may prevent or impede the realization of synergies and cost reductions absent certain postclosing reorganization transactions which may include a domination agreement or a cash merger squeezeout under german law if the effectiveness of such transactions is delayed as a result of litigation or otherwise or does not occur linde plc may be unable to initiate any transactions or measures that are disadvantageous to linde ag unless linde plc provides adequate compensation to linde ag which may preclude linde plc from implementing certain transactions related to the integration of linde into the combined group including realizing synergies the failure to realize synergies may lead to a decline of the market value of linde plc shares 

linde plc may experience a loss of customers or may fail to win new customers in certain countries 

following the completion of the business combination third parties with whom praxair or linde had relationships prior to the announcement of the business combination may terminate or otherwise reduce the scope of their relationship with either party in anticipation or after the completion of the business combination in addition the combined group may face difficulties to acquire new customers in certain countries any such loss of business or the inability to win new customers could limit the combined group’s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the business combination such risks could also be exacerbated by a delay in the settlement of the exchange offer and the business combination 

linde plc may be unable to retain and motivate praxair andor linde personnel successfully 

the success of the business combination will depend in part on linde plc’s ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees including key decisionmakers currently employed by praxair and linde such employees may decide not to remain with praxair and linde as applicable while the business combination is pending or with the combined group after the business combination is completed if key employees terminate their employment or if an insufficient number of employees are retained to maintain effective operations the combined group’s business activities may be adversely affected and management’s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating praxair and linde to hiring suitable replacements all of which may cause linde plc’s business to deteriorate praxair and linde may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave either company or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms in addition linde plc praxair and linde may not be able to motivate certain key employees following the completion of the business combination due to organizational changes reassignments of responsibilities the perceived lack of appropriate opportunities for advancement or other reasons if the combined group fails to successfully retain and motivate the employees of praxair andor linde relevant capabilities and expertise may be lost which may have an adverse effect on the cash flows and the financial condition and results of operations of linde plc praxair and linde 

a change in linde plc’s tax residency could have a negative effect on linde plc’s future profitability and may trigger taxes on dividends or exit charges 

linde plc intends to continue to manage its affairs so that it is centrally managed and controlled in and effectively managed from the united kingdom and therefore has its tax residency only in the united kingdom however we cannot assure you that linde plc is or will continue to be resident only in the united kingdom for tax purposes 

under current irish legislation an irish incorporated company will be considered irish tax resident except where it is tax resident in a territory with which ireland has a double tax treaty under the terms of the double tax treaty under current uk legislation a company that is centrally managed and controlled in the united kingdom is regarded as resident in the united kingdom for taxation purposes unless it is treated as resident in another jurisdiction pursuant to any appropriate double tax treaty with the united kingdom other jurisdictions may also seek to assert taxing jurisdiction over linde plc for example a company is subject to german taxation on its worldwide income if it has either its registered seat or place of effective management and control in germany this is a question of fact and needs to be determined on an overall assessment of the actual circumstances where a company is treated as tax resident under the domestic laws of both the united kingdom and ireland article 43 of the double tax convention between ireland and the united kingdom the “residence tiebreaker” currently provides that the company shall be treated as resident only in one of those two jurisdictions if its place of effective management is situated there a similar situation would exist if linde plc was treated as a tax resident under the domestic laws of both the united kingdom and germany or of ireland and germany 

the organisation for economic cooperation and development has proposed a number of measures relating to the tax treatment of multinationals some of which are to be implemented by amending double tax treaties through a multilateral instrument “mli” the mli has been signed by a number of countries including germany ireland and the united kingdom the mli allows signatories to opt into or out of certain changes the effect for a given double tax convention depends on the options chosen by the two contracting states ireland and the united kingdom have indicated they intend to change the residence tiebreaker so that it will depend on a ruling by the “competent authorities” that is the tax authorities of the two contracting states instead of an objective application of the place of effective management test accordingly if ireland and the united kingdom maintain their position and enough countries ratify the mli the residence tiebreaker would be amended to depend on a determination by irish revenue commissioners and hm revenue and customs it is not certain when this will take place nor what factors will be taken into account in making the determination but linde plc does not expect such a determination to alter its tax residency 

it is possible that in the future whether as a result of a change in law including the entry into force of the mli or a change to the intention of germany ireland or the united kingdom in relation to the mli or the practice of any relevant tax authority or as a result of any change in the conduct of linde plc’s affairs linde plc could become or be regarded as having become resident in a jurisdiction other than the united kingdom if linde plc ceases to be resident in the united kingdom and becomes resident in another jurisdiction it may be subject to uk exit charges and could become liable for additional tax charges in the other jurisdiction including by way of example dividend withholding taxes or corporate income tax charges if linde plc were to be treated as resident in more than one jurisdiction it could be subject to multiple taxation if for example linde plc were considered to be a tax resident of ireland linde plc could become liable for irish corporation tax and any dividends paid by it could be subject to irish dividend withholding tax if linde plc were to be treated as tax resident in germany it would become liable for german corporate income tax on its worldwide income and trade tax on its income allocable to its german business and dividends paid by linde plc to its shareholders could be subject to german dividend withholding tax and such tax may not be fully creditable or refundable under a double tax convention or the domestic rules of a shareholder 

the relevant criteria for linde plc’s treatment as a foreign corporation for us federal tax purposes may not be met or the irs may not agree with the conclusion that linde plc should be treated as such 

although linde plc is incorporated in ireland the us internal revenue service the “irs” may assert that linde plc should be treated as a us corporation and therefore a us tax resident for us federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” further changes to section 7874 of the code or the us treasury regulations promulgated thereunder or interpretations thereof could affect linde plc’s status as a foreign corporation 

for us federal income tax purposes a corporation is generally considered a us “domestic” corporation or us tax resident if it is organized in the united states and a corporation is generally considered a “foreign” corporation or nonus tax resident if it is not a us domestic corporation because linde plc is an entity incorporated in ireland it would generally be classified as a foreign corporation or nonus tax resident under these rules however code section 7874 provides an 

exception under which a foreign incorporated entity may in certain circumstances be treated as a us domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes 

unless linde plc has satisfied the substantial business activities exception as defined in section 7874 and described in more detail below the “substantial business activities exception” linde plc would be treated as a us domestic corporation  ie  as a us tax resident for us federal income tax purposes under code section 7874 if the percentage by vote or value of linde plc shares considered to be held by former holders of praxair shares after the merger by reason of holding praxair shares for purposes of code section 7874 the “section 7874 percentage” is 60 or more if as expected the “third country rule” applies under the third country rule if i there is an acquisition of a domestic company by a foreign acquiring company in which the section 7874 percentage is at least 60 reduced from the general 80 threshold otherwise applicable under section 7874 of the code and the us treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and ii in a related acquisition such foreign acquiring company acquires another foreign corporation and the foreign acquiring company is not subject to tax as a resident in the foreign country in which the acquired foreign corporation was subject to tax as a resident prior to the merger then the foreign acquiring company will be treated as a us domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes in order for linde plc to satisfy the substantial business activities exception at least 25 of the employees by headcount and compensation real and tangible assets and gross income of the linde plc expanded affiliated group must be based located and derived respectively in the country in which linde plc is a tax resident after the merger the substantial business activities exception is not expected to be satisfied 

the section 7874 percentage is currently expected to be less than 60 however the calculation of the section 7874 percentage is complex is calculated based on the facts as of the effective time of the merger is subject to detailed regulations the application of which is uncertain in various respects and would be impacted by changes in such regulations and is subject to factual uncertainties including fluctuations in the value of praxair shares and therefore in the value of linde plc shares as of the effective time of the merger as a result the irs could assert that the section 7874 percentage is greater than or equal to 60 and that linde plc therefore is treated for us federal income tax purposes as a us domestic corporation  ie  as a us tax resident if the irs successfully challenges linde plc’s status as a foreign corporation significant adverse tax consequences would result for linde plc the combined group and for certain of linde plc’s stockholders 

linde plc is not currently expected to be treated as a domestic corporation but it is possible that changes in us federal income tax law could alter that result 

transfers of linde plc ordinary shares may be subject to irish stamp duty 

for the majority of transfers of linde plc shares there will not be any irish stamp duty however irish stamp duty will become payable in respect of certain share transfers occurring after completion of the business combination a transfer of linde plc shares from a seller who holds shares beneficially  ie  through dtc or clearstream to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially will not be subject to irish stamp duty unless the transfer involves a change in the nominee that is the record holder of the transferred shares a transfer of linde plc shares by a seller who holds shares directly  ie  not through dtc or clearstream to any buyer or by a seller who holds the shares beneficially to a buyer who holds the acquired shares directly may be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired if higher payable by the buyer a shareholder who directly holds shares may transfer those shares into his or her own broker account to be held through dtcclearstream or vice versa without giving rise to irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder has confirmed to linde plc’s transfer agent that there is no change in the ultimate beneficial ownership of the shares as a result of the transfer and the transfer is not in contemplation of a sale of the shares 

because of the potential irish stamp duty on transfers of linde plc shares directly registered praxair shareholders may face disadvantages if they do not open broker accounts and do not transfer their shares into such accounts as soon as possible and in any event prior to completion of the business combination any person who wishes to acquire linde plc shares after completion of the business combination may face disadvantages if they do not acquire such shares through dtc or clearstream 

changes in tax laws and policy could adversely impact linde plcs financial position or results of operations 

linde plc praxair and linde are subject to the tax rules and regulations in the us germany ireland the uk and other countries in which linde plc praxair and linde and their affiliates operate such tax rules and regulations are subject to change on a prospective or retroactive basis under current economic and political conditions including the referendum in june 2016 in the uk in which voters approved an exit from the eu and the ongoing exit process tax rates and policies in any jurisdiction including the us the uk and eu are subject to significant change in particular since linde plc is expected to be treated as uk tax resident any potential changes in the tax rules applying to uk taxresident companies would directly 

affect linde plc 

when tax rules change this may result in a higher tax expense and the need to make higher tax payments in addition changes in tax legislation may have a significant impact on linde plc’s praxair’s and linde’s tax receivables and tax liabilities as well as on their deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities moreover uncertainty about the tax environment in some regions may restrict linde plc’s praxair’s or linde’s opportunities to enforce their respective rights under the law companies in the combined group will also operate in countries with complex tax regulations which could be interpreted in different ways interpretations of these regulations or changes in the tax system might have an adverse impact on the tax liabilities profitability and business operations of praxair linde or the combined group linde plc praxair inc and linde ag and their respective subsidiaries are subject to periodic audits by the tax authorities in various jurisdictions or other review actions by the relevant financial or tax authorities the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in linde plc’s praxair’s and linde’s financial statements and may materially affect their respective financial results for the period when such determination is made 

in the current environment the us congress the european union the organisation for economic cooperation and development and other government agencies in jurisdictions where linde plc and its affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations one area of focus has been “base erosion and profit shifting” including situations where payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates however the prospect of any reform with respect to these issues remains highly uncertain any such changes among other possible changes in applicable tax rules and regulations could affect the treatment of linde plc praxair linde or their respective affiliates or shareholders significantly additionally on december 22 2017 tax reform legislation was enacted in the united states this legislation made significant changes to the us internal revenue code that are are highly complex and unclear and there is limited guidance regarding their application the overall impact of this legislation also depends on the future interpretations and regulations that may be issued by us tax authorities 

there has been no prior public market for linde plc shares and the market price of linde plc shares may be volatile 

linde plc will list the linde plc shares on the nyse and the frankfurt stock exchange it is not expected but cannot be entirely excluded that an active public market for linde plc shares may not develop or be sustained after the completion of the business combination linde plc cannot predict the extent to which a trading market will develop or how liquid that market might become 

the market price of linde plc shares may be volatile broad general economic political market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of linde plc shares regardless of linde plc’s actual operating performance factors that could cause fluctuations in the price of linde plc shares may include among other things 

 

shareholders of linde plc may lose parts of or their entire investment if the market price of linde plc shares falls due to one or several of the described factors 

any dividend paid in respect of linde plc shares is subject to a number of factors including the distributions of earnings to linde plc by its subsidiaries the financial condition and results of operations of the combined group as well as the distributable reserves of linde plc 

although linde plc currently expects to pay dividends any dividend paid or changes to dividend policy are within the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon many factors including distributions of earnings to linde plc by its subsidiaries the financial condition and results of operations of the combined group legal requirements including limitations imposed by irish law terms of any outstanding shares of preferred stock restrictions in any debt agreements that limit its ability to pay dividends to shareholders restrictions in any series of preferred stock and other factors the board of directors deems relevant as a holding company linde plc will conduct substantially all of its operations through its subsidiaries such 

entities will generate substantially all of its operating income and cash flow and linde plc’s ability to pay dividends is limited under irish law to the extent it has distributable reserves distributable reserves means the accumulated realized profits so far as not previously utilized by distribution or capitalization less accumulated realized losses so far as not previously written off in a reduction or a reorganization of capital duly made in addition no distribution or dividend may be made if at that time the net assets of linde plc are not or would not be after giving effect to such distribution or dividend equal to or in excess of the aggregate of linde plc’s calledup share capital plus undistributable reserves linde plc’s ability to pay dividends in the future is affected by a number of factors principally on its ability to receive sufficient dividends from its subsidiaries the ability of such entities to make dividend payments to linde plc depends largely on their financial condition and ability to generate profits in addition because linde plc’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities they will have no obligation to pay any dividends or to lend or advance to linde plc funds and may be restricted from doing so by contract including other financing arrangements charter provisions other shareholders or the applicable laws and regulations of the various countries in which they operate additionally claims of the creditors of linde plc’s subsidiaries have priority over any claims that linde plc may have with respect to the assets of its subsidiaries further the ability of linde plc to direct dividend payments from linde ag may be limited subject to linde ag becoming a whollyowned indirect subsidiary of linde plc for which there can be no assurance any delay in implementing the postcompletion reorganization could adversely impact the payment of dividends from linde ag to linde plc 

linde plc will not have distributable reserves immediately following completion of the business combination until such time as linde plc creates distributable reserves through dividends from its subsidiaries the creation of distributable reserves of linde plc by reducing its share premium requires the approval of the irish high court and in connection with seeking such court approval the approval of praxair shareholders on a nonbinding advisory basis was obtained at the special meeting of shareholders of praxair inc and approval on a nonbinding advisory basis is provided by the linde ag shareholders as part of the offer acceptance to allow for the creation of distributable reserves of linde plc linde plc is not aware of any reason why the irish high court would not approve the creation of distributable reserves however the issuance of the required order is a matter for the discretion of the irish high court in the event that distributable reserves of linde plc are not created in this way distributions by way of dividends share repurchases or otherwise will generally not be permitted under irish law until such time as the group has created sufficient distributable reserves in the audited statutory financial statements of linde plc as a result of its business activities 

the rights of the shareholders of linde plc and the responsibilities of members of linde plcs board of directors will be governed by irish law and the linde plc constitution which will differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders under delaware or german law and the current organizational documents of praxair inc and linde ag 

following the completion of the business combination linde plc’s corporate affairs will be governed by the linde plc constitution and the laws governing companies incorporated in ireland the rights of linde plc shareholders and the responsibilities of members of the linde plc board of directors under the laws of ireland will differ from the rights of shareholders and the responsibilities of a company’s board of directors under the laws of delaware and the supervisory board and executive board of a company under german law 

irish law significantly limits the circumstances under which shareholders in irish companies may bring derivative actions and does not afford appraisal rights to dissenting shareholders in the form available under certain circumstances to shareholders of a us company 

praxair shareholders and linde ag shareholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the business combination and will exercise less influence over management of the combined group 

after the completion of the business combination praxair shareholders and linde ag shareholders will own a smaller percentage of linde plc than they currently own of praxair inc and linde ag respectively because ownership in linde plc shares will be allocated between praxair and linde ag shareholders in accordance with the exchange ratios set forth in the business combination agreement consequently praxair shareholders as a group will have reduced ownership and voting power in the combined group compared to their current ownership and voting power in praxair inc and linde ag shareholders as a group will have reduced ownership and voting power in the combined group compared to their current ownership and voting power in linde ag and each as a group could exercise less influence over the management and policies of the combined group than they currently have over the management and policies of praxair and linde respectively 

linde plc shareholders could be diluted in the future if linde plc increases its issued share capital because of the disapplication of statutory preemption rights in addition shareholders in certain jurisdictions including the united states may not be able to exercise their preemption rights even if those rights have not been disapplied 

as a matter of irish law holders of linde plc shares will have a preemption right with respect to any issuance of linde plc shares for cash consideration or the granting of rights to subscribe for linde plc shares for cash consideration unless such preemption right is disapplied in whole or in part either in the linde plc constitution or by resolution of the shareholders of linde plc at a general meeting of shareholders or otherwise it is intended that the linde plc constitution that will be in effect upon the completion of the business combination will disapply the statutory preemption rights to the maximum extent permitted by irish law ie  the linde plc board of directors will be permitted to issue up to all of linde plc’s authorized but unissued share capital on a non preemptive basis for cash consideration at any stage during the period of five years after the date of completion of the business combination accordingly the board of directors will have discretion to issue up to all of linde plc’s authorized but unissued share capital for cash consideration without regard to preemption rights for a period of five years from the date of completion of the business combination in addition even if the disapplication of preemption rights contained in the linde plc constitution expires and is not renewed by shareholders at general meeting or is terminated by the shareholders of linde plc in a general meeting due to laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions outside ireland shareholders in such jurisdictions may not be able to exercise their preemption rights unless linde plc takes action to register or otherwise qualify the rights offering under the laws of that jurisdiction for example in the united states us holders of linde plc shares may not be able to exercise preemption rights unless a registration statement under the securities act is declared effective with respect to the linde plc shares issuable upon exercise of such rights or an exemption from the us registration requirements is available if shareholders in such jurisdictions are unable to exercise their preemption rights their ownership interest in linde plc would be diluted any future issuance of linde plc shares or debt instruments convertible into linde plc shares where preemption rights of linde plc shareholders are not available or are excluded would result in the dilution of existing linde plc shareholders and reduce the earnings per linde plc share which could have a material adverse effect on the price of linde plc shares 

us civil liabilities may not be enforceable against linde plc 

linde plc is organized under the laws of ireland and substantial portions of its assets will be located outside of the united states in addition certain members of the board of directors of linde plc the “linde plc board of directors” reside outside the united states as a result it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the united states upon linde plc or such other persons or to enforce outside the united states judgments obtained against such persons in us courts in any action including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws in addition it may be difficult for investors to enforce in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the united states rights predicated upon the us federal securities laws 

a judgment for the payment of money rendered by a court in the united states would not be automatically enforceable in ireland there is no treaty between ireland and the united states providing for the reciprocal enforcement of foreign judgments the following requirements must be met before the foreign judgment will be deemed to be enforceable in ireland 

 an irish court will also exercise its right to refuse judgment if the foreign judgment a was obtained by fraud b violated irish public policy c is in breach of natural justice or d if the judgment is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment 

based on the foregoing there can be no assurance that us investors will be able to enforce against linde plc any member of its board of directors the linde ag supervisory board or executive board or the praxair inc board of directors or any officer of such companies or any expert named herein who is a resident of a country other than the united states any judgments obtained in us courts in civil and commercial matters including judgments under the us federal securities laws 

in addition there is doubt as to whether an irish court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability on linde plc any member of its board of directors or any officer who is a resident of a country other than the united states in an original action predicated solely upon the us federal securities laws brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in ireland against linde plc or such director or officer respectively
