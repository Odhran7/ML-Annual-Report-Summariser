other policies 

the following is a discussion of our investment policies financing policies conflict of interest policies and policies with respect to certain other activities one or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote

investment policies 

while we emphasize equity real estate investments we may also provide secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers consistent with simon’s qualification as a reit however any of these investments would be subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for reit qualification these reit limitations mean that simon cannot make an investment that would cause its real estate assets to be less than 75 of its total assets simon must also derive at least 75 of its gross income directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including “rents from real property” dividends from other reits and in certain circumstances interest from certain types of temporary investments in addition simon must also derive at least 95 of its gross income from such real property investments and from dividends interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing

subject to simon’s reit limitations we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate such an investment would normally be in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties we may in the future acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies additionally we have and may in the future make investments in entities engaged in nonreal estate activities primarily through a taxable reit subsidiary similar to the investments we currently hold in certain retail operations

financing policies 

because simon’s reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of its reit taxable income we regularly access the debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions develop and redevelop properties and refinance maturing debt we must comply with the covenants contained in our financing agreements that limit our ratio of debt to total assets or market value as defined for example the operating partnership’s lines of credit and the indentures 

for the operating partnership’s debt securities contain covenants that restrict the total amount of debt of the operating partnership to 65 or 60 in relation to certain debt of total assets as defined under the related agreements and secured debt to 50 of total assets in addition these agreements contain other covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios furthermore the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for the debt securities of the operating partnership we strive to maintain investment grade ratings at all times for various business reasons including their effect on our ability to access attractive capital but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so in the future

if simon’s board of directors determines to seek additional capital we may raise such capital by offering equity or incurring debt creating joint ventures with existing ownership interests in properties entering into joint venture arrangements for new development projects retaining cash flows or a combination of these methods if simon’s board of directors determines to raise equity capital it may without stockholder approval issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock simon’s board of directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital or may issue units in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate we may also raise additional capital by issuing common units of partnership interest in the operating partnership or units such securities also may include additional classes of simon’s preferred stock or preferred units of partnership interest in the operating partnership or preferred units which may be convertible into common stock or units as the case may be existing stockholders and unitholders have no preemptive right to purchase shares or units in any subsequent issuances of securities by us any issuance of equity could dilute a stockholder’s investment in simon or a limited partner’s investment in the operating partnership

we expect most future borrowings will be made through the operating partnership or its subsidiaries we might however incur borrowings through other entities that would be reloaned to the operating partnership borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings publicly and privately placed debt instruments or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties any such indebtedness may be secured or unsecured any such indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to the borrower or be crosscollateralized with other debt or may be fully or partially guaranteed by the operating partnership we issue unsecured debt securities through the operating partnership but we may issue other debt securities which may be convertible into common or preferred stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase common or preferred stock we also may sell or securitize our lease receivables although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends we currently have no expectation that we will regularly do so

the operating partnership has a 40 billion unsecured revolving credit facility or the credit facility and a 35 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility or supplemental facility or together the credit facilities the credit facility can be increased in the form of additional commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed 10 billion for a total aggregate size of 50 billion subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfying certain customary conditions precedent the initial maturity date of the credit facility is june 30 2024 the credit facility can be extended for two additional sixmonth periods to june 30 2025 at our sole option subject to satisfying certain customary conditions precedent 

borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at our election at either i x for term benchmark loans the adjusted term sofr rate the applicable local rate the adjusted euribor rate or the adjusted tibor rate y for rfr loans if denominated in sterling sonia plus a benchmark adjustment and if denominated in dollars daily simple sofr plus a benchmark adjustment or z for daily sofr loans the adjusted floating overnight daily sofr rate in each case of clauses x through z above plus a margin determined by our corporate credit rating of between 0650 and 1400 or ii for loans denominated in us dollars only the base rate which rate is equal to the greatest of the prime rate the federal funds effective rate plus 0500 or adjusted term sofr rate for one month plus 1000 the “base rate” plus a margin determined by our corporate credit rating of between 0000 and 0400 the credit facility includes a facility fee determined by our corporate credit rating of between 0100 and 0300 on the aggregate revolving commitments under the credit facility based upon our current credit ratings the interest rate on the credit facility is sofr plus 725 basis points plus a spread adjustment to account for the transition from libor to sofr 

the supplemental facility’s initial borrowing capacity of 35 billion may be increased to 45 billion during its term the initial maturity date of the supplemental facility is january 31 2026 and can be extended for an additional year to january 31 2027 at our sole option subject to our continued compliance with the terms thereof

borrowings under the supplemental facility bear interest at our election at either i x for term benchmark loans the adjusted term sofr rate the applicable local rate the adjusted euribor rate or the adjusted tibor rate y for rfr loans if denominated in sterling sonia plus a benchmark adjustment and if denominated in dollars daily simple sofr plus a benchmark adjustment or z for daily sofr loans the adjusted floating overnight daily sofr rate in each case of clauses x through z above plus a margin determined by our corporate credit rating of between 0650

the operating partnership also has available a global unsecured commercial paper note program or commercial paper program of 20 billion or the nonus dollar equivalent thereof the operating partnership may issue unsecured commercial paper notes denominated in us dollars euro and other currencies notes issued in nonus currencies may be issued by one or more subsidiaries of the operating partnership and are guaranteed by the operating partnership notes are sold under customary terms in the us and euro commercial paper note markets and rank either by themselves or as a result of the guarantee described above pari passu with the operating partnership’s other unsecured senior indebtedness the commercial paper program is supported by the credit facilities and if necessary or appropriate we may make one or more draws under the credit facilities to pay amounts outstanding from time to time on the commercial paper program

we may also finance our business through the following

 

the operating partnership may also issue units to contributors of properties or other partnership interests which may permit the contributor to defer tax gain recognition under the internal revenue code

we do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property 

mortgage financing instruments however typically limit additional indebtedness on such properties additionally the credit facilities our unsecured note indentures and other contracts may limit our ability to borrow and contain limits on mortgage indebtedness we may incur as well as certain financial covenants we must maintain

typically we invest in or form special purpose entities to assist us in obtaining secured permanent financing at attractive terms permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage loan on a single property or on a group of properties and generally requires us to provide a mortgage lien on the property or properties in favor of an institutional third party as a joint venture with a third party or as a securitized financing for securitized financings we create special purpose entities to own the properties these special purpose entities which are common in the real estate industry are structured so that they would not be consolidated in a bankruptcy proceeding involving a parent company we decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives for accounting purposes we include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness

conflict of interest policies 

we maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest simon has adopted governance principles governing the function conduct selection orientation and duties of its subsidiaries and simon’s board of directors and the company as well as written charters for each of the standing committees of simon’s board of directors in addition simon’s board of directors has a code of business conduct and ethics which applies to all of its officers directors and employees and those of its subsidiaries at least a majority of the members of simon’s board of directors must qualify and do qualify as independent under the listing standards of the new york stock exchange or nyse and cannot be affiliated with the simon family who are significant stockholders in simon andor unitholders in the operating partnership in addition the audit and compensation and human capital committees of simon’s board of directors are comprised entirely of independent members who meet the additional independence and financial expert requirements of the nyse as required 

the sale by the operating partnership of any property that it owns may have an adverse tax impact on the simon family or other limited partners of the operating partnership any transaction between us and the simon family including property acquisitions service and property management agreements and retail space leases must be approved by the company’s audit committee

in order to avoid any conflict of interest the simon charter requires that at least threefourths of simon’s independent directors must authorize and require the operating partnership to sell any property it owns any such sale is subject to applicable agreements with third parties a noncompetition agreement executed by herbert simon simon’s chairman emeritus and a noncompetition agreement executed by david simon simon’s chairman chief executive officer and president which remains in effect notwithstanding the expiration of david simon’s employment agreement in 2019 contain covenants limiting their ability to participate in certain shopping center activities

policies with respect to certain other activities 

we intend to make investments which are consistent with simon’s qualification as a reit unless simon’s board of directors determines that it is no longer in simon’s best interests to so qualify as a reit simon’s board of directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the reit requirements simon has authority to issue shares of its capital stock or other securities in exchange for property we previously had authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire simon’s shares the operating partnership’s units or any other securities on february 13 2017 simon’s board of directors authorized a twoyear extension of the previously authorized 20 billion common stock repurchase plan or the repurchase program through march 31 2019 and on february 11 2019 simons board of directors authorized a new common stock repurchase plan under the program the company could purchase up to 20 billion of its common stock during the twoyear period ending february 11 2021 the repurchase program was not extended simon may also issue shares of its common stock or pay cash at its option to holders of units in future periods upon exercise of such holders’ rights under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership our policy prohibits us from making any loans to the directors or executive officers of simon for any purpose we may make loans to the joint ventures in which we participate additionally we may make or buy interests in loans secured by real estate properties owned by others or make investments in companies that own real estate assets

competition 

the retail real estate industry is dynamic and competitive we compete with numerous merchandise distribution channels including malls outlet centers communitylifestyle centers and other shopping centers in the united states and abroad we also compete with internet retailing sites and catalogs including our tenants which provide retailers with distribution options beyond existing brick and mortar retail properties the existence of competitive alternatives accelerated by the impact of covid19 could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we can obtain this results in competition for both the tenants to occupy the properties that we develop and manage as well as for the acquisition of prime sites including land for development and operating properties we believe that there are numerous factors that make our properties highly desirable to retailers including

 item 1a risk factors 

the following factors among others could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations funds from operations or ffo and prospects which we refer to herein as a material adverse effect on us or as materially and adversely affecting us and you should carefully consider them additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which are currently not believed to be material may also affect our actual results we may update these factors in our future periodic reports 

summary of risk factors 

the following summarizes our material risk factors however this summary is not intended to be a comprehensive and complete list of all risk factors identified by the company refer to the following pages of this section for additional details regarding these summarized risk factors and other additional risk factors identified by the company



 

risks relating to retail operations 

the ongoing novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic and governmental restrictions intended to prevent its spread as well as other future epidemics pandemics or public health crises could have a significant negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity and our ability to access the capital markets satisfy our debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders 

the covid19 pandemic has had a material negative impact on economic and market conditions around the world and notwithstanding the fact that vaccines are being administered in the united states and elsewhere the pandemic continues to adversely impact economic activity in retail real estate the impact of the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve and governments and other authorities including where we own or hold interests in properties have imposed measures intended to control its spread including restrictions on freedom of movement group gatherings and business operations such as travel bans border closings business closures quarantines stayathome shelterinplace orders density limitations and social distancing measures governments and other authorities are in varying stages of lifting or modifying some of these measures however governments and other authorities have already been forced to and others may in the future reinstitute these measures or impose new more restrictive measures if the risks or the tenants’ and consumers perception of the risks related to the covid19 pandemic worsen at any time although tenants and consumers have been adapting to the covid19 pandemic with tenants adding services like curbside pickup and while consumer risktolerance is evolving such adaptations and evolution may take time and there is no guarantee that retail will return to prepandemic levels even once the pandemic subsides

as of december 31 2021 we owned or held an interest in 199 incomeproducing properties in the united states located in 37 states and puerto rico we also own an 80 noncontrolling interest in trg which has an interest in 24 regional superregional and outlet malls in the us and asia internationally as of december 31 2021 we had ownership interests in 33 properties primarily located in asia europe and canada and have two international outlet properties under development we have an interest in a european investee that has interests in 11 designer outlet properties as more fully described elsewhere in this annual report as of december 31 2021 we also owned a 224 equity stake in klépierre sa or klépierre a publicly traded parisbased real estate company which owns or has an interest in shopping centers located in 14 countries in europe

demand for retail space and the profitability of our properties depends in part on the ability and willingness of tenants to enter into and perform obligations under leases although the harshest restrictions to prevent the spread of covid19 have generally been lifted or reduced and vaccines are being administered in the united states and elsewhere the willingness of customers to visit our properties may be reduced and our tenants’ businesses adversely affected based upon many factors including local transmission rates the emergence of new variants the development availability distribution effectiveness and acceptance of existing and new vaccines and the effectiveness and availability of cures or treatments further demand could remain reduced due to heightened sensitivity to risks associated with the transmission of covid19 or other associated diseases in addition some of our properties are located at or within a close proximity to tourist destinations and these properties and our tenants’ businesses have been and may be in the future heavily and adversely impacted by reductions in travel and tourism resulting from travel bans or restrictions and general concern regarding the risk of travel

the continuing impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders could depend on additional factors including



 

to the extent any of these risks and uncertainties adversely impact us in the ways described above or otherwise they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein

conditions that adversely affect the general retail environment could materially and adversely affect us 

our concentration in the retail real estate market – our primary source of revenue is retail tenants – means that we could be materially and adversely affected by conditions that materially and adversely affect the retail environment generally including without limitation



 

additionally a portion of our lease income is derived from overage rents based on sales over a stated base amount that directly depend on the sales volume of our retail tenants accordingly declines in our tenants’ sales performance could reduce the income produced by our properties

some of our properties depend on anchor stores or other large nationally recognized tenants to attract shoppers and we could be materially and adversely affected by the loss of one or more of these anchors or tenants 

our properties are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally recognized tenants certain of our anchors and other tenants have ceased their operations downsized their brickandmortar presence or failed to comply with their contractual obligations to us and others and such actions have become more prevalent during the covid19 pandemic 

sustained adverse pressure on the results of department stores and other national retailers may have a similarly sustained adverse impact upon our own results certain department stores and other national retailers have experienced and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future given uncertainty with respect to current and future macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence levels considerable decreases in customer traffic in their retail stores increased competition from alternative retail options such as those accessible via the internet and other forms of pressure on their business models as pressure on these department stores and other national retailers increases especially due to the covid19 pandemic their ability to maintain their stores meet their obligations both to us and to their external lenders and suppliers withstand takeover attempts or avoid bankruptcy andor liquidation may be impaired and result in closures of their stores or their seeking of a lease modification with us any lease modification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and could decrease current or future effective rents or expense recovery charges certain other tenants are entitled to modify the economic or other terms of or terminate their existing leases with us in the event of such closures additionally corporate merger or consolidation activity among department stores and other national retailers typically results in the closure of duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations

if a department store or large nationally recognized tenant were to close its stores at our properties we may experience difficulty and delay and incur significant expense in retenanting the space as well as in leasing spaces in areas adjacent to the vacant store at attractive rates or at all additionally department store or tenant closures may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sales at our properties if the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to the closing of anchor stores or other national retailers adverse economic conditions or other reasons tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges in the event of any default by a tenant we may not be able to fully recover andor may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our leases with such parties

we face potential adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies 

bankruptcy filings by retailers can occur regularly in the course of our operations although we did not see an increase in tenant bankruptcies in 2021 in previous years a number of companies in the retail industry including certain of our tenants have declared bankruptcy and these numbers have increased due to the covid19 pandemic if a tenant files for bankruptcy the tenant may have the right to reject and terminate one or more of its leases with us and we cannot be sure that it will affirm one or more of its leases and continue to make rental payments to us in a timely manner a 

bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants would generally prohibit us from evicting this tenant and bar all efforts by us to collect prebankruptcy debts from that tenant or from their property unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court in addition we cannot evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy if a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy all prebankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full if a lease is rejected the unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims and there are restrictions under bankruptcy laws that limit the amount of the claim we can make if a lease is rejected as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold in addition we may make lease modifications either pre or postbankruptcy for certain tenants undergoing significant financial distress in order for them to continue as a going concern furthermore we may be required to incur significant expense in retenanting the space formerly leased to the bankrupt tenant we continually seek to release vacant spaces resulting from tenant terminations the bankruptcy of a tenant particularly an anchor tenant or a national tenant with multiple locations may require a substantial redevelopment of its space the success of which cannot be assured and may make the retenanting of its space difficult and costly any such bankruptcies also make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the space at the affected property or properties future tenant bankruptcies may strain our resources and impact our ability to successfully execute our releasing strategy and could materially and adversely affect us

we face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably including ecommerce 

our properties compete with other forms of retailing such as pure online retail websites as well as other retail properties such as single user freestanding discounters costco walmart and target in addition many of our tenants are omnichannel retailers who also distribute their products through online sales our business currently is predominantly reliant on consumer demand for shopping at physical stores and we could be materially and adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in adapting our business to evolving consumer purchasing habits the increased popularity of digital and mobile technologies has accelerated the transition of a percentage of market share from shopping at physical stores to webbased shopping and the ongoing covid19 pandemic and restrictions intended to prevent its spread have significantly increased the utilization of ecommerce and may particularly in certain market segments accelerate the longterm penetration of pure online retail which has been able to sell nonessential goods during the covid19 pandemic not only has the temporary closure of our retail properties and the restrictions put in place by state local and federal officials caused consumers who otherwise would have purchased from retailers at our properties to increase their utilization of pure online retail websites but consumers whose previous use of online retail was low or nonexistent have recently turned to pure online retail as a necessity due to the inability to access our properties and the ability to purchase nonessential goods from these pure online retailers although a brickandmortar presence may have a positive impact on retailers’ online sales the increased utilization of pure online shopping may lead to the closure of underperforming stores by retailers which could impact our occupancy levels and the rates that tenants are willing to pay to lease our space

vacant space at our properties could materially and adversely affect us 

certain of our properties have had vacant space available for prospective tenants and those properties may continue to experience and other properties may commence experiencing such oversupply in the future among other causes 1 there has been an increased number of bankruptcies of anchor stores and other national retailers as well as store closures and 2 there has been lower demand from retail tenants for space due to certain retailers increasing their use of ecommerce websites to distribute their merchandise with each of 1 and 2 accelerating as a result of the covid19 pandemic as a result of the increased bargaining power of creditworthy retail tenants there is downward pressure on our rental rates and occupancy levels and this increased bargaining power may also result in us having to increase our spend on tenant improvements and potentially make other lease modifications in order to attract or retain tenants any of which in the aggregate could materially and adversely affect us

we may not be able to lease newly developed properties to or renew leases and relet space at existing properties with an appropriate mix of tenants if at all 

we may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants that generates optimal customer traffic also when leases for our existing properties expire the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms if we fail to identify and secure the right blend of tenants at our newly developed and existing properties our properties may not appeal to the communities they serve if we elect to pursue a “mixed use” redevelopment we expose ourselves to risks associated with each nonretail use eg office residential hotel and entertainment and the performance of our retail tenants in such 

properties may be negatively impacted by delays in opening andor the performance of such nonretail uses to the extent that our leasing goals are not achieved we could be materially and adversely affected

risks relating to real estate investments and operations 

our international activities may subject us to risks that are different from or greater than those associated with our domestic operations 

as of december 31 2021 we held interests in consolidated and joint venture properties that operate in austria canada france italy germany japan malaysia mexico the netherlands south korea spain thailand and the united kingdom we also have an equity stake in klépierre a publicly traded european real estate company which operates in 14 countries in europe accordingly our operating results and the value of our international operations may be impacted by any unhedged movements in the foreign currencies in which those operations transact and in which our net investment in those international operations is held while we occasionally enter into hedging agreements to manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates these agreements may not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely 

we may pursue additional investment ownership development and redevelopmentexpansion opportunities outside the united states such international activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our domestic properties and operations these risks include but are not limited to

 

our international activities represented approximately 71 of consolidated net income and 85 of our net operating income or noi for the year ended december 31 2021 to the extent that we expand our international activities the above risks could increase in significance which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us

we face risks associated with the acquisition development redevelopment and expansion of properties 

we regularly acquire and develop new properties and redevelop and expand existing properties and these activities are subject to various risks we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition development or redevelopmentexpansion opportunities in addition newly acquired developed or redevelopedexpanded properties may not perform as well as expected impacting our anticipated return on investment we are subject to other risks in connection with any acquisition development and redevelopmentexpansion activities including the following



 

if a development or redevelopmentexpansion project is unsuccessful either because it is not meeting our expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project planning we could lose our investment in the project further if we guarantee the property’s financing our loss could exceed our investment in the project

in the event that these risks were realized at the same time at multiple properties we could be materially and adversely affected

real estate investments are relatively illiquid 

our properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets these investments are relatively illiquid as a result our ability to sell one or more of our properties or investments in real estate in response to any changes in economic industry or other conditions may be limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability and terms of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand for space that are beyond our control if we want to sell a property we cannot assure you that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or at all or that the sales price of a property will be attractive at the relevant time or exceed the carrying value of our investment moreover if a property is mortgaged we may not be able to obtain a release of the lien on that property without the payment of the associated debt andor a substantial prepayment penalty which could restrict our ability to dispose of the property even though the sale might otherwise be desirable

risks relating to debt and the financial markets 

we have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations 

as of december 31 2021 our consolidated mortgages and unsecured indebtedness excluding related premium discount and debt issuance costs totaled 254 billion as a result of this indebtedness we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows for debt service including selected repayment at scheduled maturities which limits our ability to use those cash flows to fund the growth of our business we are also subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flows from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service or that we will be able to refinance such indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the applicable property such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants cause a reduction in the income from the property our indebtedness could also have other adverse consequences on us including reducing our access to capital or increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic industry and market conditions in addition if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value if any of the foregoing occurs we could be materially and adversely affected

the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that might affect our ability to operate freely 

we have a variety of unsecured debt including the credit facilities senior unsecured notes and commercial paper and secured property level debt certain of the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain covenants including among other things limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured indebtedness sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and certain acquisitions in addition certain of the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain financial covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios including certain coverage ratios these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous to us in addition our ability to comply with these provisions might be affected by events beyond our control failure to comply with any of our financing covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate the related indebtedness as well as other of our indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on us

disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements 

we depend on external financings principally debt financings to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt our access to financing depends on our credit ratings the willingness of lending institutions and other debt investors to grant credit to us and conditions in the capital markets in general an economic recession may cause extreme volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets we rely upon the credit facilities as sources of funding for numerous transactions our access to these funds is dependent upon the ability of each of the participants to the credit facilities to meet their funding commitments to us when markets are volatile access to capital and credit markets could be disrupted over an extended period of time and one or more financial institutions may not have the available capital to meet their previous commitments to us the failure of one or more participants to the credit facilities to meet their funding commitments to us could have a material adverse effect on us including as a result of making it difficult to obtain the financing we may need for future growth andor meeting our debt service requirements we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for the future growth of our business or to meet our debt service requirements or that a sufficient amount of financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all

adverse changes in our credit ratings could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

the operating partnership’s outstanding senior unsecured notes the credit facilities the commercial paper program and simon’s preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios financial condition and prospects and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to us and our industry and the economic outlook in general our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund the growth of our business an adverse change in our credit ratings including actual changes and changes in outlook or even the initiation of a review of our credit ratings that could result in an adverse change could have a material adverse effect on us

an increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt on attractive terms or at all our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 20 billion of outstanding consolidated indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates and we may incur more variable rate indebtedness in the future if interest rates increase then so would the interest costs on our unhedged variable rate debt which could adversely affect our cash flows and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders further rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or significantly increase our future interest expense

we selectively manage our exposure to interest rate risk by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap all or a portion of our variable rate debt in addition we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and other terms are appropriate our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful

our use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations or that we could be required to fund our contractual payment obligations under such arrangements in relatively large amounts or on short notice developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs

we may be adversely affected by developments in the london interbank offered rate libor market changes in the methods by which libor is determined or the use of alternative reference rates 

as of december 31 2021 approximately 20 or 5014 million of our debt outstanding was indexed to libor in 2021 we amended the credit facility and the supplemental facility to transition the borrowing rates from libor to successor benchmark indexes in 2017 the uk financial conduct authority the “fca” announced that it intends to phase out libor and in 2021 it announced that all libor settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after december 31 2021 in the case of 1 week and 2 month usd setting and immediately after june 30 2023 in the case of the remaining usd settings the us federal reserve the “federal reserve” has also advised banks to cease entering into new contracts that use usd libor as a reference rate the alternative refinance rate committee a committee convened by the federal reserve that includes major market 

participants has identified the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements backed by us treasury securities as its preferred alternative rate for libor in the us working groups formed by financial regulators in other jurisdictions including the uk the european union japan and switzerland have also recommended alternatives to libor denominated in their local currencies although sofr appears to be the preferred replacement rate for usd libor it is unclear if other benchmarks may emerge or if other rates will be adopted outside of the united states at this time it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to sofr or other alternative reference rates as the transition away from the libor benchmark is anticipated in coming years accordingly the outcome of these reforms is uncertain and any changes in the methods by which libor is determined or regulatory activity related to libor’s phaseout could cause libor to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted and there can be no assurance that they will not result in financial market disruptions significant increases in benchmark interest rates substantially higher financing costs or a shortage of available debt financing any of which could have an adverse effect on us which currently would be limited by our relatively low exposure to variable rate liborbased debt

risks relating to income taxes 

simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership have elected to be taxed as reits in the united states the failure to maintain simon’s or the subsidiary reits’ qualifications as reits or changes in applicable tax laws or regulations could result in adverse tax consequences 

in the united states simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership have elected to be taxed as reits under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code we believe that simon and these subsidiaries or the subsidiary reits have been organized and have operated in a manner which allows them to qualify for taxation as reits under the internal revenue code we intend to continue to operate in this manner however qualification and taxation as reits depend upon the ability of simon and the subsidiary reits to satisfy several requirements some of which are outside our control including tests related to our annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various reit qualification tests required by the internal revenue code are highly technical and complex accordingly there can be no assurance that simon or any of the subsidiary reits has operated in accordance with these requirements or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit

if simon or any of the subsidiary reits fail to comply with those provisions simon or any such subsidiary reit may be subject to monetary penalties or ultimately to possible disqualification as reits if such events occur and if available relief provisions do not apply

 

any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for among other things our operations and distributions to stockholders in addition if simon fails to qualify as a reit it will not be required to make distributions to our stockholders moreover a failure by any subsidiary of the operating partnership that has elected to be taxed as a reit to qualify as a reit would also cause simon to fail to qualify as a reit and the same adverse consequences would apply to it and its stockholders failure by simon or any of the subsidiary reits to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital which could materially and adversely affect us

additionally we are subject to certain incomebased taxes both domestically and internationally and other taxes including state and local taxes franchise taxes and withholding taxes on dividends from certain of our international 

investments we currently follow local tax laws and regulations in various domestic and international jurisdictions should these laws or regulations change the amount of taxes we pay may increase accordingly

if the operating partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes we would cease to qualify as a reit and suffer other adverse consequences 

we believe that the operating partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes as a partnership the operating partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income instead each of its partners including us is allocated and may be required to pay tax with respect to such partner’s share of its income we cannot assure you that the internal revenue service or the irs will not challenge the status of the operating partnership or any other subsidiary partnership or limited liability company in which we own an interest as a disregarded entity or partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership or any such other subsidiary as an entity taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to reits and accordingly we would likely cease to qualify as a reit also the failure of the operating partnership or any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability company to qualify as a disregarded entity or partnership for applicable income tax purposes could cause it to become subject to federal and state corporate income tax which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners or members including us

our ownership of trss is subject to certain restrictions and we will be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our trss are not conducted on arm’slength terms 

we own securities in taxable reit subsidiaries or trss and may acquire securities in additional trss in the future a trs is a corporation other than a reit in which a reit directly or indirectly holds stock and that has made a joint election with such reit to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary if a trs owns more than 35 of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation such other corporation will also be treated as a trs other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities a trs may generally engage in any business including the provision of customary or noncustomary services to tenants of its parent reit a trs is subject to federal income tax as a regular c corporation in addition a 100 excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a trs and its parent reit that are not conducted on an arm’s length basis

a reit’s ownership of securities of a trs is not subject to the 5 or 10 asset tests applicable to reits not more than 25 of the value of simon’s or any subsidiary reit’s total assets may be represented by securities including securities of trss other than those securities includable in the 75 asset test and not more than 20 of the value of our total assets or the assets of any subsidiary reit may be represented by securities of trss we anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of any trs and other nonqualifying assets that simon or each such subsidiary reit owns will be less than 25 or 20 as applicable of the value of simon’s or such subsidiary’s total assets and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable ownership limitations in addition we intend to structure transactions with any trss that we own to ensure that they are entered into on arm’s length terms to avoid incurring the 100 excise tax described above there can be no assurance however that we will be able to comply with the above limitations or to avoid application of the 100 excise tax discussed above

dividends payable by reits generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends which may negatively affect the value of our shares 

income from “qualified dividends” payable to us stockholders that are individuals trusts and estates are generally subject to tax at preferential rates currently at a maximum federal rate of 20 dividends payable by reits however generally are not eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income under the tax cuts and jobs act or the tcja however us stockholders that are individuals trusts and estates generally may deduct up to 20 of the ordinary dividends eg dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income received from a reit for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by reits generally to 296 assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37 maximum rate such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income accordingly investors who are individuals trusts and estates may perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could materially and adversely affect the value of the shares of reits including the per share trading price of our common stock

the tax imposed on reits engaging in “prohibited transactions” may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for us federal income tax purposes 

a reit’s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100 penalty tax in general prohibited transactions 

are sales or other dispositions of property other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the irs would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors

reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan 

in order for simon and the subsidiary reits to qualify to be taxed as reits and assuming that certain other requirements are also satisfied simon and each such subsidiary reit generally must distribute at least 90 of their respective reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains to their respective equity holders each year to this point simon and each such subsidiary reit have historically distributed at least 100 of its taxable income and thereby avoided income tax altogether to the extent that simon or any such subsidiary reit satisfies this distribution requirement and qualifies for taxation as a reit but distributes less than 100 of its reit taxable income simon or such subsidiary will be subject to us federal corporate income tax on its undistributed net taxable income and could be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that is distributed to equity holders in a calendar year is less than the minimum required distribution amount we intend to make distributions to the equity holders of simon and the subsidiary reits to comply with the reit requirements of the internal revenue code

from time to time simon and the subsidiary reits might generate taxable income greater than their respective cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments if simon or the subsidiary reits do not have other funds available in these situations simon or such subsidiaries could be required to access capital on unfavorable terms the receipt of which cannot be assured sell assets at disadvantageous prices distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions capital expenditures or repayment of debt or make taxable distributions of capital stock or debt securities to make distributions sufficient to enable them to pay out enough of their respective reit taxable income to satisfy the reit distribution requirement and avoid corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase costs or reduce our equity further amounts distributed will not be available to fund the growth of our business thus compliance with the reit requirements may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan

complying with reit requirements might cause us to forgo otherwise attractive acquisition opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments 

to qualify to be taxed as reits for us federal income tax purposes simon and the subsidiary reits must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of their respective assets consist of cash cash items government securities and “real estate assets” as defined in the internal revenue code including certain mortgage loans and securities the remainder of their respective investments other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a trs generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer

additionally in general no more than 5 of the value of simon’s and the subsidiary reits’ total assets other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a trs can consist of the securities of any one issuer and no more than 20 of the value of their respective total assets can be represented by securities of one or more trss if simon or any of the subsidiary reits fails to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter simon or any such subsidiary reit must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing its reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences as a result we might be required to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive investments these actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to equity holders moreover if simon or the subsidiary reits are compelled to liquidate their investments to meet any of the asset income or distribution tests or to repay obligations to lenders simon or such subsidiaries may be unable to comply with one or more of the requirements applicable to reits or may be subject to a 100 tax on any resulting gain if such sales constitute prohibited transactions

in addition to the asset tests set forth above to qualify to be taxed as reits simon and the subsidiary reits must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of their respective income the amounts they distribute to equity holders and the ownership of their respective shares we might be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the sourceofincome or assetdiversification requirements for qualifying as reits thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments

partnership tax audit rules could have a material adverse effect on us 

the bipartisan budget act of 2015 changed the rules applicable to us federal income tax audits of partnerships under the rules among other changes and subject to certain exceptions any audit adjustment to items of income gain loss deduction or credit of a partnership and any partner’s distributive share thereof is determined and taxes interest or penalties attributable thereto could be assessed and collected at the partnership level absent available elections it is possible that a partnership in which we directly or indirectly invest could be required to pay additional taxes interest and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment and we as a direct or indirect partner of these partnerships could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes interest and penalties even though simon and the subsidiary reits as reits may not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporatelevel taxes had they owned the assets of the partnership directly the partnership tax audit rules apply to the operating partnership and its subsidiaries that are classified as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes the changes created by these rules are sweeping and accordingly there can be no assurance that these rules will not have a material adverse effect on us 

legislative administrative regulatory or other actions affecting reits including positions taken by the irs could have a material adverse effect on us and our investors 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us department of the treasury or the treasury changes to the tax laws or interpretations thereof by the irs and the treasury with or without retroactive application could materially and adversely affect us and our investors new legislation including the tcja and any technical corrections legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect the ability of simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership to qualify to be taxed as reits andor the us federal income tax consequences to us and our investors of such qualification

the tcja has significantly changed the us federal income taxation of us businesses and their owners including reits and their stockholders a change made by the tcja that could affect us and our stockholders is that it generally limits the deduction for net business interest expense in excess of 30 of a business’s adjusted taxable income except for taxpayers that engage in certain real estate businesses and elect out of this rule provided that such electing taxpayers must use an alternative depreciation system for certain property 

risks relating to joint ventures 

we have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance them 

as of december 31 2021 we owned interests in 101 incomeproducing properties with other parties of those 17 properties are included in our consolidated financial statements we apply the equity method of accounting to the other 84 properties the joint venture properties and our investments in klépierre a publicly traded parisbased real estate company and the taubman realty group llc or trg as well as our investments in certain entities involved in retail operations such as jc penney and sparc group intellectual property and licensing ventures such as authentic brands group llc or abg and eddie bauer ipco and an ecommerce venture rue gilt groupe or rgg collectively our other platform investments we serve as general partner or property manager for 53 of these 84 joint venture properties however certain major decisions such as approving the operating budget and selling refinancing and redeveloping the properties require the consent of the other owners of the joint venture properties for which we do not serve as general partner or property manager 23 are in our international joint ventures these international properties are managed locally by joint ventures in which we share control of the properties with our partner the other owners have participating rights that we consider substantive for purposes of determining control over the joint venture properties’ assets the remaining joint venture properties klépierre trg and our joint ventures with abg jc penney rgg and sparc group are managed by third parties

these investments and other future similar investments could involve risks that would not be present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or other owners might become bankrupt suffer a deterioration in their creditworthiness or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions if one of our partners or other owners in these investments were to become bankrupt we may be precluded from taking certain actions regarding our investments without prior court approval which at a minimum may delay the actions we would or might want to take additionally partners or other owners could have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our own business interests or goals and could be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives

these investments and other future similar investments also have the potential risk of creating impasses on 

decisions such as a sale financing or development because neither we nor our partner or other owner has full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or other owners might result in litigation or arbitration that could increase our expenses and prevent simon’s officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or other owners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we risk the possibility of being liable for the actions of our partners or other owners 

the operating partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties 

joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property which is nonrecourse to us nevertheless the joint venture’s failure to satisfy its debt obligations could result in the loss of our investment therein as of december 31 2021 the operating partnership guaranteed joint venturerelated mortgage indebtedness of 2099 million a default by a joint venture under its debt obligations would expose us to liability under a guaranty we may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests advances or partner loans although such fundings are not typically required contractually or otherwise 

risks relating to environmental matters 

as owners of real estate we can face liabilities for environmental contamination and our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful 

many of our properties contain or at one time contained asbestos containing materials or underground storage tanks primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment and as a result we may be subject to regulatory action in connection with us federal state and local laws and regulations relating to hazardous or toxic substances we may also be held liable to third parties for personal injury or property damage incurred by the parties in connection with any such substances the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances and related liabilities may be substantial and could materially and adversely affect us the presence of hazardous or toxic substances or the failure to remediate the related contamination may also adversely affect our ability to sell lease or redevelop a property or to borrow money using a property as collateral

although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with us federal state and local environmental laws and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances this belief is based on limited testing nearly all of our properties have been subjected to phase i or similar environmental audits these environmental audits have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us however we cannot assure you that

 

we face risks associated with climate change 

due to changes in weather patterns caused by climate change our properties in certain markets could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels over time climate change could result in volatile or decreased demand for retail space at certain of our properties or in extreme cases our inability to operate the properties at all climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of or making unavailable insurance on favorable terms or at all increasing the cost of energy at our properties or requiring us to spend funds to repair and protect our properties against such risks moreover compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change including compliance with “green” building codes may require us to make improvements to our existing properties or increase taxes and fees assessed on us or our properties

some of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters 

a number of our properties are located in areas subject to a higher risk of natural disasters such as earthquakes fires hurricanes floods tornados hail or tsunamis the occurrence of natural disasters which could become more intense and more volatile in light of climate change can adversely impact operations and developmentredevelopment projects at our properties increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms or our insurance is not adequate to cover losses from these events we could be materially and adversely affected

other factors affecting our business 

some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance 

we maintain insurance coverage with thirdparty carriers who provide a portion of the coverage for specific layers of potential losses including commercial general liability fire flood extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties in the united states as well as cyber coverage the initial portion of coverage excess of policy deductibles not provided by thirdparty carriers is either insured through our whollyowned captive insurance company or other financial arrangements controlled by us a third party carrier has in turn agreed to provide if required evidence of coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carrier’s policy a similar policy either written through our captive insurance company or other financial arrangements controlled by us also provides initial coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal windstorm locations

there are some types of losses including lease and other contract claims which generally are not insured or are subject to large deductibles if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue it could generate but may remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligation related to the property

we currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the united states on an “all risk” basis in the amount of up to 1 billion despite the existence of this insurance coverage any threatened or actual terrorist attacks where we operate could materially and adversely affect our property values revenues consumer traffic and tenant sales

we face risks associated with security breaches through cyber ‑ attacks cyber intrusions or otherwise as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology it networks and related systems 

our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform daytoday operations and in some cases may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants we face risks associated with security breaches whether through cyberattacks or cyber intrusions over the internet malware computer viruses hardware or software corruption or failure or poor product or vendordeveloper selection including a failure of security controls incorporated into or applied to such hardware or software service provider error or failure intentional or unintentional actions by employees including the failure to follow our security protocols and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging even the most well protected information networks systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed not to be detected and in fact may not be detected accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk

the risk of a security breach or significant disruption has generally increased due to our increased reliance on technology a rise in the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks globally and the remote working environment throughout the covid19 pandemic a breach or significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our systems including our primary website could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers tenants and revenues generate third party claims cause operational disruption result in the unintended andor unauthorized public disclosure or the misappropriation of proprietary personal identifying and confidential information and require us to incur significant expenses to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues we may not be able to recover these expenses in whole or in any part from our service providers or responsible parties or their or our insurers additionally cyberattacks perpetrated against our tenants including unauthorized access to customers’ credit card data and other confidential information could diminish consumer confidence and spending and materially and adversely affect us

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain talented employees and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our business 

the success of our business depends in part on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees including our ceo who operate without the existence of employment agreements many of our senior executives have extensive experience and strong reputations in the real estate industry which aid us in identifying opportunities and negotiating with tenants our ability to attract retain and motivate talented employees could significantly impact our future performance competition for these individuals is intense and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive management team and other key employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future losing any one or more of these persons could adversely affect our business diminish our opportunities and weaken our relationships with lenders business partners existing and prospective tenants and others which could have a material adverse effect on us

provisions in simon’s charter and by ‑ laws and in the operating partnership’s partnership agreement could prevent a change of control 

simon’s charter contains a general restriction on the accumulation of shares in excess of 8 of its capital stock the charter permits the members of the simon family and related persons to own up to 18 of simon’s capital stock ownership is determined by the lower of the number of outstanding shares voting power or value controlled simon’s board of directors may by majority vote permit exceptions to those levels in circumstances where simon’s board of directors determines that simon’s ability to qualify as a reit will not be jeopardized these restrictions on ownership may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interest of simon’s stockholders or the operating partnership’s unitholders or preferred unitholders other provisions of simon’s charter and bylaws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control even if some of simon’s stockholders or the operating partnership’s unitholders or preferred unitholders deem such a change to be in their best interests these include provisions preventing holders of simon’s common stock from acting by written consent and requiring that up to four directors in the aggregate may be elected by holders of class b common stock in addition certain provisions of the operating partnership’s partnership agreement could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control these include a provision requiring the consent of a majority in interest of units in order for simon as general partner of the operating partnership to among other matters engage in a merger transaction or sell all or substantially all of its assets

land 

we have direct or indirect ownership interests in approximately 127 acres of land held in the united states and canada for future development

sustainability 

at simon we define and implement sustainability and environmental social and governance or esg initiatives into all aspects of our business from how we plan develop and operate our properties to how we do business with our customers engage with our communities and create a healthy safe productive and positive work environment for our employees our sustainability framework focuses on four key areas customers communities environment and employees

the health and safety of all who work in and visit our properties has and continues to be our top priority and beginning in 2020 and sustained through 2021 we enrolled and successfully achieved the international well building institute’s well third party verified well healthsafety rating for facility operations and management for over 200 properties in our portfolio this rating was earned primarily as a result of our emergency management program and the implementation of simon’s rigorous covid19 exposure mitigation protocols to learn more about our healthsafety efforts and rating visit wwwsimoncomhealth

since 2003 we have measured our environmental impact and utilized sustainability to reduce this impact while achieving cost efficiencies in our operations by implementing a range of energy management practices as a result we have reduced our energy consumption every year since 2003 in this period excluding new developments we have reduced the energy usage over which we have direct control by 540 million kwh representing a 51 reduction across a portfolio of comparable properties in recent years we have ramped up these efforts and from 20132020 have achieved an energy use reduction of 370 million kwh representing a 41 reduction in a sevenyear period accounting for 69 of total reductions achieved since 2003

our reduction in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our energy management efforts since 2003 is 384962 metric tons of co2e this figure represents a reduction of 67 and includes emission streams scope 1 and scope 2 enhanced efforts from 20132020 have resulted in emissions reduction of 199886 metric tons of co2e this represents a 51 reduction in a sevenyear period accounting for 52 of total reductions achieved since 2003 additional emission streams such as scope 3 emissions generated from tenants’ plugload consumption are included in simon’s annual sustainability report published in accordance with the guidelines of the global reporting initiatives gri

we are also focused on reducing our water usage and have a goal of reducing consumption by 20 from levels established in 2013 before 2025 while in 2020 we achieved a reduction of 25 in water use this was primarily due to governmental restrictions which caused the temporary closure of our properties therefore simon is not comparing fy2020 water consumption against its 2025 target and we will release our water consumption against the 20 reduction goal in 2022 

in 2020 due to governmental restrictions many centers were closed temporarily for this reason our environmental impact during 2020 shows a steep decrease compared to other years our energy consumption decreased in this period by 27 and our carbon emissions from our properties decreased by 26 we used 25 less water in 2020 compared to 2019 and collected 42 less solid waste since our assets were not open for approximately 13500 shopping days during 2020 these reductions do not represent actual environmental improvements alone but a combination of these and the many actions our management teams took to reduce operational expenditures during the closures for this reason the reductions from 2019 to 2020 should not be viewed as continuing on an annual basis

in 2020 simon announced new 2035 emissions targets approved by the science based target initiative sbti our commitment is to reduce scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 68 2019 baseline and scope 3 including tenant emissions by 21 2018 baseline we are developing our “roadmap to 2035” which will identify how we will plan to achieve our new sciencebased targets and that will detail all aspects of our business that will include a sustainability focus our complete “low carbon transition plan” will be published in the future we also continue to align our climaterelated risk disclosure with the recommendations made by the task force on climate related financial disclosures tcfd established by the financial stability board fsb 

simon’s sustainability performance improved in 2021 and has been recognized by international organizations in 2021 simon again participated in cdp’s annual climate change questionnaire and for the 2nd consecutive year received an a score earning a prestigious place on cdp’s climate change ‘a list’ that represents results achieved by only 200 of the 13000 15 reporting organizations globally in 2021 simon was once again awarded a green star ranking 2014

2021  the highest designation awarded for leadership in sustainability performance by the global real estate sustainability benchmark gresb simon was also awarded 28 new institute of real estate management irem® certified sustainable property certifications irem csp across our portfolio and renewed our certifications at the shops at crystals the irem csp is a prestigious sustainability certification program that focuses on the role of exceptional real estate management in green building performance finally simon was recognized for the first time as a “best places to work for disability inclusion” by disability in for our continued efforts in diversity and inclusion

we also grow by generating supplemental revenues from the following activities



 

 

we focus on high quality real estate across the retail real estate spectrum we expand or redevelop properties to enhance profitability and market share of existing assets when we believe the investment of our capital meets our riskreward criteria we selectively develop new properties in markets we believe are not adequately served by existing retail outlet properties

we routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio our international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk

to support our growth we employ a threefold capital strategy

 

we consider ffo net operating income or noi and portfolio noi to be key measures of operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or gaap we use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure are included below in this discussion

our effective overall borrowing rate at december 31 2021 on our consolidated indebtedness decreased 12 basis points to 286 as compared to 298 at december 31 2020 this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the effective overall borrowing rate on variable rate debt of 11 basis points 120 at december 31 2021 as compared to 131 at december 31 2020 and a decrease in the effective overall borrowing rate on fixed rate debt of 22 basis points 328 at december 31 2021 as compared to 350 at december 31 2020 the weighted average years to maturity of our consolidated indebtedness was 78 years and 73 years at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively

united states portfolio data 

the portfolio data discussed in this overview includes the following key operating statistics ending occupancy and average base minimum rent per square foot we include acquired properties in this data beginning in the year of acquisition and remove disposed properties in the year of disposition for comparative information purposes we separate the information related to the mills from our other us operations we also do not include any information for properties located outside the united states or properties included in trg

ending occupancy levels and average base minimum rent per square foot ending occupancy is the percentage of gross leasable area or gla which is leased as of the last day of the reporting period we include all company owned space except for mall anchors mall majors mall freestanding and mall outlots in the calculation base minimum rent per square foot is the average base minimum rent charge in effect for the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in ending occupancy

total reported sales per square foot given all of our us retail properties were closed for a portion of the prior year due to the covid19 pandemic we are not presenting reported retail tenant sales per square foot as we do not believe the trends for the period are indicative of future operating trends

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

income and other tax expense changed by 347 million primarily as a result of a higher tax benefit due to larger losses on our share of operating results in the retail operations venture of sparc group as compared to 2019 and reduced withholding and income taxes related to certain of our international investments partially offset by tax expense from a bargain purchase gain recorded as a result of the acquisition of our interest in forever 21

income from unconsolidated entities decreased 2245 million primarily due to unfavorable yearoveryear domestic and international property operations as well as results of operations from our other platform investments both of which were impacted by covid19 disruption partially offset by a 350 million pretax noncash bargain purchase gain recorded as a result of the acquisition of our interest in forever 21 and a gain from the sale of a nonretail asset of which our share was 178 million 

during 2020 we recorded 1256 million of impairment charges related to one consolidated property an otherthantemporary impairment on our equity investment in three joint venture properties an otherthantemporary impairment to reduce an investment to its estimated fair value and a 43 million loss net related to the impairment and disposition of certain assets by klépierre partially offset by a 123 million gain on the disposal of our interest in one consolidated property a 19 million excess gain on insurance proceeds related to our two properties in puerto rico and a 10 million gain related to the disposition of a shopping center by one of our joint venture investments during 2019 we recorded net gains of 621 million primarily related to klépierre’s disposition of certain shopping centers offset by a 472 million impairment charge related to an unconsolidated investment 

simon’s net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased 1568 million due to a decrease in the net income of the operating partnership 

liquidity and capital resources 

because we own longlived incomeproducing assets our financing strategy relies primarily on longterm fixed rate debt floating rate debt comprised only 76 of our total consolidated debt at december 31 2021 we also enter into interest rate protection agreements from time to time to manage our interest rate risk we derive most of our liquidity from positive net cash flow from operations and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities that totaled 39 billion in the aggregate during 2021 the credit facilities and the commercial paper program provide alternative sources of liquidity as our cash needs vary from time to time borrowing capacity under these sources may be increased as discussed further below

our balance of cash and cash equivalents decreased 4777 million during 2021 to 5339 million as of december 31 2021 as further discussed below

on december 31 2021 we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of approximately 58 billion under the facilities net of outstanding borrowings of 118 billion amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program of 5000 million and letters of credit of 118 million for the year ended december 31 2021 the maximum aggregate outstanding balance under the credit facilities was 21 billion and the weighted average outstanding balance was 5199 million the weighted average interest rate was 085 for the year ended december 31 2021 

simon has historically had access to public equity markets and the operating partnership has historically had access to private and public short and longterm unsecured debt markets and access to secured debt and private equity from institutional investors at the property level

our business model and simon’s status as a reit require us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition development and redevelopment activity and to refinance maturing debt simon may also from time to time access the equity capital markets to accomplish our business objectives we believe we have sufficient cash on hand and availability under the credit facilities and the commercial paper program to address our debt maturities and capital needs through 2022

cash flows 

our net cash flow from operating activities and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities totaled 39 billion during 2021 in addition we had net repayments of debt from our debt financing and repayment activities of 08 billion in 2021 these activities are further discussed below under “financing and debt” during 2021 we also

 

in general we anticipate that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating expenses monthly debt service recurring capital expenditures and dividends to stockholders andor distributions to partners necessary to maintain simon’s reit qualification on a longterm basis at this time we do not expect the impact of covid19 to impact our ability to fund these needs for the foreseeable future however its ultimate impact is difficult to predict in addition we expect to be able to generate or obtain capital for nonrecurring capital expenditures such as acquisitions major building redevelopments and expansions as well as for scheduled principal maturities on outstanding indebtedness from the following however a severe and prolonged disruption and instability in the global financial markets including the debt and equity capital markets may affect our ability to access necessary capital

 

we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2022 and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash these cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our tenants a significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations including one due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic and restrictions intended to restrict its spread could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds from the credit facilities and commercial paper program further curtail planned capital expenditures or seek other additional sources of financing

summary of capital expenditures the following table summarizes total capital expenditures on consolidated properties on a cash basis in millions

 ​ 

​ 

international development activity 

we typically reinvest net cash flow from our international joint ventures to fund future international development activity we believe this strategy mitigates some of the risk of our initial investment and our exposure to changes in foreign currencies we have also funded most of our foreign investments with local currencydenominated borrowings that act as a natural hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates our consolidated net income exposure to changes in the volatility of the euro yen peso won and other foreign currencies is not material we expect our share of estimated committed capital for international development projects to be completed with projected delivery in 2022 or 2023 is 172 million primarily funded through reinvested joint venture cash flow and construction loans

the following table describes recently completed and new development and expansion projects as well as our share of the estimated total cost as of december 31 2021 in millions

nongaap financial measures 

industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties in part based on performance measures such as ffo diluted ffo per share noi and portfolio noi we believe that these nongaap measures are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of reits and provide a relevant basis for comparison among reits we also use these measures internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio

we determine ffo based upon the definition set forth by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” funds from operations white paper – 2018 restatement our main business includes acquiring owning operating developing and redeveloping real estate in conjunction with the rental of real estate gains and losses of assets incidental to our main business are included in ffo we determine ffo to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with gaap

 

you should understand that our computations of these nongaap measures might not be comparable to similar measures reported by other reits and that these nongaap measures

 

the following schedule reconciles total ffo to consolidated net income and for simon diluted net income per share to diluted ffo per share

 



 

the following schedule reconciles consolidated net income to our beneficial share of noi

 



 

item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our longterm debt obligations we manage exposure to interest rate market risk through our risk management strategy by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of variable rate debt we are also exposed to foreign currency risk on financings of certain foreign operations our intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging these exposures we do not enter into either interest rate protection or foreign currency rate protection agreements for speculative purposes

we may enter into treasury lock agreements as part of anticipated issuances of senior notes upon completion of the debt issuance the cost of these instruments is recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt agreement

our future earnings cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest primarily sofr and libor based upon consolidated indebtedness and interest rates at december 31 2021 a 50 basis point increase in the market rates of interest would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 99 million and would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately 7919 million

for a description of our operational strategies and developments in our business during 2020 see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k

other policies 

the following is a discussion of our investment policies financing policies conflict of interest policies and policies with respect to certain other activities one or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote

investment policies 

while we emphasize equity real estate investments we may also provide secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers consistent with simon’s qualification as a reit however any of these investments would be subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for reit qualification these reit limitations mean that simon cannot make an investment that would cause its real estate assets to be less than 75 of its total assets simon must also derive at least 75 of its gross income directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including “rents from real property” dividends from other reits and in certain circumstances interest from certain types of temporary investments in addition simon must also derive at least 95 of its gross income from such real property investments and from dividends interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing

subject to simon’s reit limitations we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate such an investment would normally be in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties we may in the future acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies additionally we have and may in the future make investments in entities engaged in nonreal estate activities primarily through a taxable reit subsidiary similar to the investments we currently hold in certain retail operations

financing policies 

because simon’s reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of its reit taxable income we regularly access the debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions develop and redevelop properties and refinance maturing debt we must comply with the covenants contained in our financing agreements that limit our ratio of 

debt to total assets or market value as defined for example the operating partnership’s lines of credit and the indentures for the operating partnership’s debt securities contain covenants that restrict the total amount of debt of the operating partnership to 65 or 60 in relation to certain debt of total assets as defined under the related agreements and secured debt to 50 of total assets in addition these agreements contain other covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios furthermore the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for the debt securities of the operating partnership we strive to maintain investment grade ratings at all times for various business reasons including their effect on our ability to access attractive capital but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so in the future

if simon’s board of directors determines to seek additional capital we may raise such capital by offering equity or incurring debt creating joint ventures with existing ownership interests in properties entering into joint venture arrangements for new development projects retaining cash flows or a combination of these methods if simon’s board of directors determines to raise equity capital it may without stockholder approval issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock simon’s board of directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital or may issue units in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate we may also raise additional capital by issuing common units of partnership interest in the operating partnership or units such securities also may include additional classes of simon’s preferred stock or preferred units of partnership interest in the operating partnership or preferred units which may be convertible into common stock or units as the case may be existing stockholders and unitholders have no preemptive right to purchase shares or units in any subsequent issuances of securities by us any issuance of equity could dilute a stockholder’s investment in simon or a limited partner’s investment in the operating partnership

we expect most future borrowings will be made through the operating partnership or its subsidiaries we might however incur borrowings through other entities that would be reloaned to the operating partnership borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings publicly and privately placed debt instruments or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties any such indebtedness may be secured or unsecured any such indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to the borrower or be crosscollateralized with other debt or may be fully or partially guaranteed by the operating partnership we issue unsecured debt securities through the operating partnership but we may issue other debt securities which may be convertible into common or preferred stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase common or preferred stock we also may sell or securitize our lease receivables although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends we currently have no expectation that we will regularly do so

the operating partnership has a 40 billion unsecured revolving credit facility or credit facility a 20 billion delayeddraw term loan facility or term facility and a 35 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility or supplemental facility or together the facilities the credit facility and the term facility can be increased in the form of either additional commitments under the credit facility or incremental term loans under the term facility in an aggregate amount for all such increases not to exceed 10 billion for a total aggregate size of 70 billion in each case subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfying certain customary conditions precedent the initial maturity date of the term facility and credit facility are june 30 2022 and june 30 2024 respectively each of the term facility and credit facility can be extended for two additional sixmonth periods to june 30 2023 and june 30 2025 respectively at our sole option subject to satisfying certain customary conditions precedent the term facility was available via a single draw during the ninemonth period following march 16 2020 and was drawn on in 2020 prior to expiring 

borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the operating partnership’s election at either i libor plus a margin determined by the operating partnership’s corporate credit rating of between 065 and 140 or ii the base rate which rate is equal to the greatest of the prime rate the federal funds effective rate plus 050 or libor plus 100 the “base rate” plus a margin determined by the operating partnership’s corporate credit rating of between 000 and 040 the credit facility includes a facility fee determined by the operating partnership’s corporate credit rating of between 010 and 030 on the aggregate revolving commitments under the credit facility the credit facility contains a money market competitive bid option program that allows the operating partnership to hold auctions to achieve lower pricing for shortterm borrowings borrowings under the term facility bear interest at the operating partnership’s election at either i libor plus a margin determined based on the operating partnership’s corporate credit rating of between 0725 and 160 or ii the base rate equal to the greatest of the prime rate the federal funds effective rate plus 050 or libor plus 100 plus a margin determined by the operating partnership’s corporate credit rating of between 000 and 060 the term facility includes a ticking fee equal to 010 of the unused term loan commitment under the term facility which ticking fee commenced accruing on the date that is fortyfive days after the closing of the term facility

the supplemental facility’s initial borrowing capacity of 35 billion may be increased to 45 billion during its term the initial maturity date of the supplemental facility is june 30 2022 and can be extended for an additional year to june 30 

2023 at our sole option subject to our continued compliance with the terms thereof the base interest rate on the supplemental facility is libor plus 775 basis points with an additional facility fee of 10 basis points the credit facility and supplemental facility or together the credit facilities provide for borrowings denominated in us dollars euro yen sterling canadian dollars and australian dollars

the operating partnership also has available a global unsecured commercial paper note program or commercial paper program of 20 billion or the nonus dollar equivalent thereof the operating partnership may issue unsecured commercial paper notes denominated in us dollars euro and other currencies notes issued in nonus currencies may be issued by one or more subsidiaries of the operating partnership and are guaranteed by the operating partnership notes are sold under customary terms in the us and euro commercial paper note markets and rank either by themselves or as a result of the guarantee described above pari passu with the operating partnership’s other unsecured senior indebtedness the commercial paper program is supported by the credit facilities and if necessary or appropriate we may make one or more draws under the credit facilities to pay amounts outstanding from time to time on the commercial paper program

we may also finance our business through the following

 

the operating partnership may also issue units to contributors of properties or other partnership interests which may permit the contributor to defer tax gain recognition under the internal revenue code

we do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property 

mortgage financing instruments however typically limit additional indebtedness on such properties additionally the credit facilities our unsecured note indentures and other contracts may limit our ability to borrow and contain limits on mortgage indebtedness we may incur as well as certain financial covenants we must maintain

typically we invest in or form special purpose entities to assist us in obtaining secured permanent financing at attractive terms permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage loan on a single property or on a group of properties and generally requires us to provide a mortgage lien on the property or properties in favor of an institutional third party as a joint venture with a third party or as a securitized financing for securitized financings we create special purpose entities to own the properties these special purpose entities which are common in the real estate industry are structured so that they would not be consolidated in a bankruptcy proceeding involving a parent company we decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives for accounting purposes we include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness

conflict of interest policies 

we maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest simon has adopted governance principles governing the function conduct selection orientation and duties of its subsidiaries and simon’s board of directors and the company as well as written charters for each of the standing committees of simon’s board of directors in addition simon’s board of directors has a code of business conduct and ethics which applies to all of its officers directors and employees and those of its subsidiaries at least a majority of the members of simon’s board of directors must qualify and do qualify as independent under the listing standards of the new york stock exchange or nyse and cannot be affiliated with the simon family who are significant stockholders in simon andor unitholders in the operating partnership in addition the audit and compensation committees of simon’s board of directors are comprised entirely of independent members who meet the additional independence and financial expert requirements of the nyse as required 

the sale by the operating partnership of any property that it owns may have an adverse tax impact on the simon family or other limited partners of the operating partnership any transaction between us and the simon family including property acquisitions service and property management agreements and retail space leases must be approved by the company’s audit committee

in order to avoid any conflict of interest the simon charter requires that at least threefourths of simon’s independent directors must authorize and require the operating partnership to sell any property it owns any such sale is subject to applicable agreements with third parties a noncompetition agreement executed by herbert simon simon’s chairman emeritus and a noncompetition agreement executed by david simon simon’s chairman chief executive officer and president which remains in effect notwithstanding the expiration of david simon’s employment agreement in 2019 contain covenants limiting their ability to participate in certain shopping center activities

policies with respect to certain other activities 

we intend to make investments which are consistent with simon’s qualification as a reit unless simon’s board of directors determines that it is no longer in simon’s best interests to so qualify as a reit simon’s board of directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the reit requirements simon has authority to issue shares of its capital stock or other securities in exchange for property we also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire simon’s shares the operating partnership’s units or any other securities on february 13 2017 simon’s board of directors authorized a twoyear extension of the previously authorized 20 billion common stock repurchase plan or the repurchase program through march 31 2019 and on february 11 2019 simons board of directors authorized a new common stock repurchase plan under the program the company could purchase up to 20 billion of its common stock during the twoyear period ending february 11 2021 under the repurchase program simon may repurchase the shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at december 31 2020 we had remaining authority to repurchase 15 billion of common stock which has subsequently expired simon may also issue shares of its common stock or pay cash at its option to holders of units in future periods upon exercise of such holders’ rights under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership our policy prohibits us from making any loans to the directors or executive officers of simon for any purpose we may make loans to the joint ventures in which we participate additionally we may make or buy interests in loans secured by real estate properties owned by others or make investments in companies that own real estate assets

competition 

the retail real estate industry is dynamic and competitive we compete with numerous merchandise distribution channels including malls outlet centers communitylifestyle centers and other shopping centers in the united states and abroad we also compete with internet retailing sites and catalogs including our tenants which provide retailers with distribution options beyond existing brick and mortar retail properties the existence of competitive alternatives accelerated by the impact of covid19 could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we can obtain this results in competition for both the tenants to occupy the properties that we develop and manage as well as for the acquisition of prime sites including land for development and operating properties we believe that there are numerous factors that make our properties highly desirable to retailers including

 item 1a risk factors 

the following factors among others could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations funds from operations or ffo and prospects which we refer to herein as a material adverse effect on us or as materially and adversely affecting us and you should carefully consider them additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which are currently not believed to be material may also affect our actual results we may update these factors in our future periodic reports 

summary of risk factors 

the following summarizes our material risk factors however this summary is not intended to be a comprehensive and complete list of all risk factors identified by the company refer to the following pages of this section for additional details regarding these summarized risk factors and other additional risk factors identified by the company



 

risks relating to retail operations 

the ongoing novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic and governmental restrictions intended to prevent its spread as well as other future epidemics pandemics or public health crises could have a significant negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity and our ability to access the capital markets satisfy our debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders 

the covid19 pandemic has already had a significant negative impact on economic and market conditions around the world in 2020 and notwithstanding the fact that vaccines have started to be administered in the united states and elsewhere the pandemic continues to adversely impact economic activity in retail real estate the impact of the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve and governments and other authorities including where we own or hold interests in properties have imposed measures intended to control its spread including restrictions on freedom of movement group gatherings and business operations such as travel bans border closings business closures quarantines stayathome shelterinplace orders density limitations and social distancing measures governments and other authorities are in varying stages of lifting or modifying some of these measures however governments and other authorities have already been forced to and others may in the future reinstitute these measures or impose new more restrictive measures if the risks or the tenants’ and consumers perception of the risks related to the covid19 pandemic worsen at any time although tenants and consumers have been adapting to the covid19 pandemic with tenants adding services like curbside pickup and while consumer risktolerance is evolving such adaptations and evolution may take time and there is no guarantee that retail will return to prepandemic levels even once the pandemic subsides

as of december 31 2020 we owned or held an interest in 203 incomeproducing properties in the united states located in 37 states and puerto rico we also own an 80 noncontrolling interest in trg which has an interest in 24 regional superregional and outlet malls in the us and asia internationally as of december 31 2020 we had ownership interests in 31 properties primarily located in asia europe and canada and have one international outlet property under development we have an interest in a european investee that has interests in ten designer outlet properties as more fully described elsewhere in this annual report as of december 31 2020 we also owned a 224 equity stake in klépierre sa or klépierre a publicly traded parisbased real estate company which owns or has an interest in shopping centers located in 15 countries in europe

demand for retail space and the profitability of our properties depends in part on the ability and willingness of tenants to enter into and perform obligations under leases on march 18 2020 after extensive discussions with federal state and local officials and in recognition of the need to address the spread of covid19 we closed all of our retail properties in the united states we gradually reopened retail properties beginning may 1st in markets where local and state closure mandates had been lifted and retail restrictions had been eased as of october 7th all of our domestic retail properties had reopened but we do not have certainty that additional closures in the future will not be required in addition a number of tenants have not reopened at our properties and we do not have certainty that all of them will reopen as of december 31 all of our domestic retail properties remained open in addition even after certain restrictions intended to prevent the spread of covid19 are lifted or reduced the willingness of customers to visit our properties is likely to be reduced and our tenants businesses are likely to be adversely affected based upon many factors including whether the number of covid19 transmissions is materially reduced how quickly vaccinations which prevent or reduce the severity of covid19 become readily available or a cure or treatment is identified and becomes readily available further demand could remain reduced due to heightened sensitivity to risks associated with the transmission of covid19 or other associated diseases in addition some of our properties are located at or within a close proximity to tourist destinations and these properties and our tenants businesses are therefore heavily and adversely impacted by reductions in travel and tourism resulting from travel bans or restrictions and general public concern regarding the risk of travel

during the period of closure of all of our retail properties we have experienced a significant reduction in cash rent collections which may continue for an indeterminate period with respect to those tenants from whom we have not received payment we have been engaged in discussions with substantially all of them we have agreed to deferral or abatement arrangements with a number of our tenants resulting in rent deferrals with tenants the vast majority of which we expect to receive over the course of 2021 and rent abatement with tenants representing in the aggregate less than 160 of our us portfolio gross contractual rents for the second third and fourth quarters of 2020 discussions with our tenants are 

ongoing and may result in further rent deferrals lease restructures abatements andor lease terminations as we deem appropriate on a casebycase basis based on each tenants unique financial and operating situation

in connection with rent deferrals or other accruals of unpaid rent although we will not receive cash rent payments as scheduled if we determine that rent payments are probable of collection we will continue to recognize lease income on a straightline basis over the lease term and associated tenant receivables until the time of payment however if we determine that such deferred rent payments or other accrued but unpaid rent payments are not probable of collection lease income will be recorded as the lesser of the amount that would be recognized on a straightline basis or cash that has been received from the tenant with any tenant receivable and deferred rent receivable balances charged as a direct writeoff against rental income in the period of the change in our collectability determination as a result we may experience material impacts including but not limited to changes in the ability to recognize revenue due to changes in the probability of collection and reductions in rental income associated with writeoffs of tenant receivable and deferred rent receivable balances in addition any rent abatements we have granted and may potentially grant in the future will be accounted for as negative variable lease consideration in the period granted or agreed thereby reducing lease income

the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders could depend on additional factors including

 

to the extent any of these risks and uncertainties adversely impact us in the ways described above or otherwise they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein

conditions that adversely affect the general retail environment could materially and adversely affect us 

our concentration in the retail real estate market – our primary source of revenue is retail tenants – means that we could be materially and adversely affected by conditions that materially and adversely affect the retail environment generally including without limitation

 

additionally a portion of our lease income is derived from overage rents based on sales over a stated base amount that directly depend on the sales volume of our retail tenants accordingly declines in our tenants’ sales performance could reduce the income produced by our properties

some of our properties depend on anchor stores or other large nationally recognized tenants to attract shoppers and we could be materially and adversely affected by the loss of one or more of these anchors or tenants 

our properties are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally recognized tenants certain of our anchors and other tenants have ceased their operations downsized their brickandmortar presence or failed to comply with their contractual obligations to us and others and such actions have become more prevalent during the covid19 pandemic 

sustained adverse pressure on the results of department stores and other national retailers may have a similarly sustained adverse impact upon our own results certain department stores and other national retailers have experienced and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future given uncertainty with respect to current and future macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence levels considerable decreases in customer traffic in their retail stores increased competition from alternative retail options such as those accessible via the internet and other forms of pressure on their business models as pressure on these department stores and other national retailers increases especially due to the covid19 pandemic their ability to maintain their stores meet their obligations both to us and to their external lenders and suppliers withstand takeover attempts or avoid bankruptcy andor liquidation may be impaired and result in closures of their stores or their seeking of a lease modification with us any lease modification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and could decrease current or future effective rents or expense recovery charges certain other tenants are entitled to modify the economic or other terms of or terminate their existing leases with us in the event of such closures additionally corporate merger or consolidation activity among department stores and other national retailers typically results in the closure of duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations

if a department store or large nationally recognized tenant were to close its stores at our properties we may experience difficulty and delay and incur significant expense in retenanting the space as well as in leasing spaces in areas adjacent to the vacant store at attractive rates or at all additionally department store or tenant closures may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sales at our properties if the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to the closing of anchor stores or other national retailers adverse economic conditions or other reasons tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges in the event of any default by a tenant we may not be able to fully recover andor may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our leases with such parties

we face potential adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies 

bankruptcy filings by retailers can occur regularly in the course of our operations in recent years a number of companies in the retail industry including certain of our tenants have declared bankruptcy and these numbers have increased in 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic if a tenant files for bankruptcy the tenant may have the right to reject and terminate one or more of its leases with us and we cannot be sure that it will affirm one or more of its leases and continue to make rental payments to us in a timely manner a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants would generally prohibit us from evicting this tenant and bar all efforts by us to collect prebankruptcy debts from that tenant or from their property unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court in addition we cannot evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy if a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy all prebankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full if a lease is rejected the unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims and there are restrictions under bankruptcy laws that limit the amount of the claim we can make if a lease is rejected as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold in addition we may make lease modifications either pre or postbankruptcy for certain tenants undergoing significant financial distress in order for them to continue as a going concern furthermore we may be required to incur significant expense in retenanting the space formerly leased to the bankrupt tenant we continually seek to release vacant spaces resulting from tenant terminations the bankruptcy of a tenant particularly an anchor tenant or a national tenant with multiple locations may require a substantial redevelopment of its space the success of which cannot be assured and may make the retenanting of its space difficult and costly any such bankruptcies also make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the space at the affected property or properties future tenant bankruptcies may strain our resources and impact our ability to successfully execute our releasing strategy and could materially and adversely affect us

we face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably including ecommerce 

our properties compete with other forms of retailing such as pure online retail websites as well as other retail properties such as single user freestanding discounters costco walmart and target in addition many of our tenants are omnichannel retailers who also distribute their products through online sales our business currently is predominantly reliant on consumer demand for shopping at physical stores and we could be materially and adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in adapting our business to evolving consumer purchasing habits the increased popularity of digital and mobile technologies has accelerated the transition of a percentage of market share from shopping at physical stores to webbased shopping and the ongoing covid19 pandemic and restrictions intended to prevent its spread have significantly increased the utilization of ecommerce and may particularly in certain market segments accelerate the long

term penetration of pure online retail which has been able to sell nonessential goods during the covid19 pandemic not only has the temporary closure of our retail properties and the restrictions put in place by state local and federal officials caused consumers who otherwise would have purchased from retailers at our properties to increase their utilization of pure online retail websites but consumers whose previous use of online retail was low or nonexistent have recently turned to pure online retail as a necessity due to the inability to access our properties and the ability to purchase nonessential goods from these pure online retailers although a brickandmortar presence may have a positive impact on retailers’ online sales the increased utilization of pure online shopping may lead to the closure of underperforming stores by retailers which could impact our occupancy levels and the rates that tenants are willing to pay to lease our space

vacant space at our properties could materially and adversely affect us 

certain of our properties have had vacant space available for prospective tenants and those properties may continue to experience and other properties may commence experiencing such oversupply in the future among other causes 1 there has been an increased number of bankruptcies of anchor stores and other national retailers as well as store closures and 2 there has been lower demand from retail tenants for space due to certain retailers increasing their use of ecommerce websites to distribute their merchandise with each of 1 and 2 accelerating in 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic as a result of the increased bargaining power of creditworthy retail tenants there is downward pressure on our rental rates and occupancy levels and this increased bargaining power may also result in us having to increase our spend on tenant improvements and potentially make other lease modifications in order to attract or retain tenants any of which in the aggregate could materially and adversely affect us

we may not be able to lease newly developed properties to or renew leases and relet space at existing properties with an appropriate mix of tenants if at all 

we may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants that generates optimal customer traffic also when leases for our existing properties expire the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms if we fail to identify and secure the right blend of tenants at our newly developed and existing properties our properties may not appeal to the communities they serve if we elect to pursue a “mixed use” redevelopment we expose ourselves to risks associated with each nonretail use eg office residential hotel and entertainment and the performance of our retail tenants in such properties may be negatively impacted by delays in opening andor the performance of such nonretail uses to the extent that our leasing goals are not achieved we could be materially and adversely affected

risks relating to real estate investments and operations 

our international activities may subject us to risks that are different from or greater than those associated with our domestic operations 

as of december 31 2020 we held interests in consolidated and joint venture properties that operate in austria canada france italy germany japan malaysia mexico the netherlands south korea spain thailand and the united kingdom we also have an equity stake in klépierre a publicly traded european real estate company which operates in 15 countries in europe accordingly our operating results and the value of our international operations may be impacted by any unhedged movements in the foreign currencies in which those operations transact and in which our net investment in those international operations is held while we occasionally enter into hedging agreements to manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates these agreements may not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely 

we may pursue additional investment ownership development and redevelopmentexpansion opportunities outside the united states such international activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our domestic properties and operations these risks include but are not limited to



 

our international activities represented approximately 19 of consolidated net income and 91 of our net operating income or noi for the year ended december 31 2020 to the extent that we expand our international activities the above risks could increase in significance which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us

we face risks associated with the acquisition development redevelopment and expansion of properties 

we regularly acquire and develop new properties and redevelop and expand existing properties and these activities are subject to various risks we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition development or redevelopmentexpansion opportunities in addition newly acquired developed or redevelopedexpanded properties may not perform as well as expected impacting our anticipated return on investment we are subject to other risks in connection with any acquisition development and redevelopmentexpansion activities including the following

 

if a development or redevelopmentexpansion project is unsuccessful either because it is not meeting our expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project planning we could lose our investment in the project further if we guarantee the property’s financing our loss could exceed our investment in the project

in the event that these risks were realized at the same time at multiple properties we could be materially and adversely affected

real estate investments are relatively illiquid 

our properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets these investments are relatively illiquid as a result our ability to sell one or more of our properties or investments in real estate in response to any changes in economic industry or other conditions may be limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability and terms of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand for space that are beyond our control if we want to sell a property we cannot assure you that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or at all or that the sales price of a property will be attractive at the relevant time or exceed the carrying value of our investment moreover if a property is mortgaged we may not be able to obtain a release of the lien on that property without the payment of the associated debt andor a substantial prepayment penalty which 

could restrict our ability to dispose of the property even though the sale might otherwise be desirable

risks relating to debt and the financial markets 

we have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations 

as of december 31 2020 our consolidated mortgages and unsecured indebtedness excluding related premium discount and debt issuance costs totaled 268 billion as a result of this indebtedness we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows for debt service including selected repayment at scheduled maturities which limits our ability to use those cash flows to fund the growth of our business we are also subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flows from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service or that we will be able to refinance such indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the applicable property such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants cause a reduction in the income from the property our indebtedness could also have other adverse consequences on us including reducing our access to capital or increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic industry and market conditions in addition if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value if any of the foregoing occurs we could be materially and adversely affected

the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that might affect our ability to operate freely 

we have a variety of unsecured debt including the credit facilities senior unsecured notes and commercial paper and secured property level debt certain of the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain covenants including among other things limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured indebtedness sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and certain acquisitions in addition certain of the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain financial covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios including certain coverage ratios these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous to us in addition our ability to comply with these provisions might be affected by events beyond our control failure to comply with any of our financing covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate the related indebtedness as well as other of our indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on us

disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements 

we depend on external financings principally debt financings to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt our access to financing depends on our credit ratings the willingness of lending institutions and other debt investors to grant credit to us and conditions in the capital markets in general an economic recession may cause extreme volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets we rely upon the credit facilities as sources of funding for numerous transactions our access to these funds is dependent upon the ability of each of the participants to the credit facilities to meet their funding commitments to us when markets are volatile access to capital and credit markets could be disrupted over an extended period of time and one or more financial institutions may not have the available capital to meet their previous commitments to us the failure of one or more participants to the credit facilities to meet their funding commitments to us could have a material adverse effect on us including as a result of making it difficult to obtain the financing we may need for future growth andor meeting our debt service requirements we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for the future growth of our business or to meet our debt service requirements or that a sufficient amount of financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all

adverse changes in our credit ratings could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

the operating partnership’s outstanding senior unsecured notes the credit facilities the commercial paper program and simon’s preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios financial condition and prospects and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to us and our industry and the economic outlook in general our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund the growth of our business an adverse change in our credit ratings including actual changes and changes in outlook or even the initiation of a review of our credit ratings that could result in an adverse change could have a material adverse effect on us

an increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt on attractive terms or at all our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 33 billion of outstanding consolidated indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates and we may incur more variable rate indebtedness in the future if interest rates increase then so would the interest costs on our unhedged variable rate debt which could adversely affect our cash flows and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders further rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or significantly increase our future interest expense

we selectively manage our exposure to interest rate risk by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap all or a portion of our variable rate debt in addition we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and other terms are appropriate our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful

our use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations or that we could be required to fund our contractual payment obligations under such arrangements in relatively large amounts or on short notice developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs

we may be adversely affected by developments in the london interbank offered rate libor market changes in the methods by which libor is determined or the use of alternative reference rates 

as of december 31 2020 approximately 110 or 29 billion of our debt outstanding was indexed to libor in july 2017 the uk financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates libor announced its intention to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 accordingly there is considerable uncertainty regarding the publication of libor beyond 2021 the federal reserve board convened the alternative reference rates committee “arrc” to identify a set of alternative reference rates for possible use as market benchmarks based on the arrc’s recommendation the federal reserve bank of new york began publishing the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” and two other alternative rates beginning in april 2018 since then certain derivative products and debt securities tied to sofr have been introduced and a number of industry groups are developing transition plans to sofr as the new market benchmark 

we are not able to predict whether libor will actually cease to be available after 2021 or whether sofr will become the market benchmark in its place any changes announced or adopted by the fca or other authorities or institutions in the methods used for determining libor or the transition from libor to a successor benchmark may result in among other things a sudden or prolonged increase in libor a delay in the publication of libor higher interest obligations arising from such successor benchmark and changes in the rules or methodologies for determining libor in the overall debt capital markets which may discourage market participants from continuing to administer or to participate in variable rate debt tied to libor or such successor benchmark if libor as determined in accordance with the terms of our particular debt is no longer available whether during or after 2021 the interest rates on such debt would be determined using various alternative methods any of which may result in interest obligations which are more than or do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on such debt if libor was available in its current form as a result there can be no assurance that any of the aforementioned developments or changes will not result in financial market disruptions significant increases in benchmark interest rates substantially higher financing costs or a shortage of available debt financing any of which could have an adverse effect on us which currently would be limited by our relatively low exposure to variable rate liborbased debt

risks relating to income taxes 

simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership have elected to be taxed as reits in the united states the failure to maintain simon’s or the subsidiary reits’ qualifications as reits or changes in applicable tax laws or regulations could result in adverse tax consequences 

in the united states simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership have elected to be taxed as reits under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code we believe that simon and these subsidiaries or the subsidiary reits have been organized and have operated in a manner which allows them to qualify for taxation as reits under the internal revenue code we intend to continue to operate in this manner however qualification and taxation as 

reits depend upon the ability of simon and the subsidiary reits to satisfy several requirements some of which are outside our control including tests related to our annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various reit qualification tests required by the internal revenue code are highly technical and complex accordingly there can be no assurance that simon or any of the subsidiary reits has operated in accordance with these requirements or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit

if simon or any of the subsidiary reits fail to comply with those provisions simon or any such subsidiary reit may be subject to monetary penalties or ultimately to possible disqualification as reits if such events occur and if available relief provisions do not apply

 

any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for among other things our operations and distributions to stockholders in addition if simon fails to qualify as a reit it will not be required to make distributions to our stockholders moreover a failure by any subsidiary of the operating partnership that has elected to be taxed as a reit to qualify as a reit would also cause simon to fail to qualify as a reit and the same adverse consequences would apply to it and its stockholders failure by simon or any of the subsidiary reits to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital which could materially and adversely affect us

additionally we are subject to certain incomebased taxes both domestically and internationally and other taxes including state and local taxes franchise taxes and withholding taxes on dividends from certain of our international investments we currently follow local tax laws and regulations in various domestic and international jurisdictions should these laws or regulations change the amount of taxes we pay may increase accordingly

if the operating partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes we would cease to qualify as a reit and suffer other adverse consequences 

we believe that the operating partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes as a partnership the operating partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income instead each of its partners including us is allocated and may be required to pay tax with respect to such partner’s share of its income we cannot assure you that the internal revenue service or the irs will not challenge the status of the operating partnership or any other subsidiary partnership or limited liability company in which we own an interest as a disregarded entity or partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership or any such other subsidiary as an entity taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to reits and accordingly we would likely cease to qualify as a reit also the failure of the operating partnership or any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability company to qualify as a disregarded entity or partnership for applicable income tax purposes could cause it to become subject to federal and state corporate income tax which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners or members including us

our ownership of trss is subject to certain restrictions and we will be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our trss are not conducted on arm’slength terms 

we own securities in taxable reit subsidiaries or trss and may acquire securities in additional trss in the future a trs is a corporation other than a reit in which a reit directly or indirectly holds stock and that has made a joint election with such reit to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary if a trs owns more than 35 of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation such other corporation will also be treated as a trs other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities a trs may generally engage in any business including the provision of customary or noncustomary services to tenants of its parent reit a trs is subject to federal income tax as a regular c corporation in addition a 100 excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a trs and its parent reit that are not conducted on an arm’s length basis

a reit’s ownership of securities of a trs is not subject to the 5 or 10 asset tests applicable to reits not more than 25 of the value of simon’s or any subsidiary reit’s total assets may be represented by securities including securities of trss other than those securities includable in the 75 asset test and not more than 20 of the value of our total assets or the assets of any subsidiary reit may be represented by securities of trss we anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of any trs and other nonqualifying assets that simon or each such subsidiary reit owns will be less than 25 or 20 as applicable of the value of simon’s or such subsidiary’s total assets and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable ownership limitations in addition we intend to structure transactions with any trss that we own to ensure that they are entered into on arm’s length terms to avoid incurring the 100 excise tax described above there can be no assurance however that we will be able to comply with the above limitations or to avoid application of the 100 excise tax discussed above

dividends payable by reits generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends which may negatively affect the value of our shares 

income from “qualified dividends” payable to us stockholders that are individuals trusts and estates are generally subject to tax at preferential rates currently at a maximum federal rate of 20 dividends payable by reits however generally are not eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income under the tax cuts and jobs act or the tcja however us stockholders that are individuals trusts and estates generally may deduct up to 20 of the ordinary dividends eg dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income received from a reit for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by reits generally to 296 assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37 maximum rate such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income accordingly investors who are individuals trusts and estates may perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could materially and adversely affect the value of the shares of reits including the per share trading price of our common stock

the tax imposed on reits engaging in “prohibited transactions” may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for us federal income tax purposes 

a reit’s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100 penalty tax in general prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the irs would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors

reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan 

in order for simon and the subsidiary reits to qualify to be taxed as reits and assuming that certain other requirements are also satisfied simon and each such subsidiary reit generally must distribute at least 90 of their respective reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains to their respective equity holders each year to this point simon and each such subsidiary reit have historically distributed at least 100 of its taxable income and thereby avoided income tax altogether to the extent that simon or any such subsidiary reit satisfies this distribution requirement and qualifies for taxation as a reit but distributes less than 100 of its reit taxable income simon or such subsidiary will be subject to us federal corporate income tax on its undistributed net taxable income and could be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that is distributed to equity holders in a calendar year is less than the minimum required distribution amount we intend to make distributions to the equity holders of simon and the subsidiary reits to comply with the reit requirements of the internal revenue code

from time to time simon and the subsidiary reits might generate taxable income greater than their respective cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments if simon or the subsidiary reits do not have other funds available in these situations simon or such subsidiaries could be required to access capital on unfavorable terms the receipt of which cannot be assured sell assets at disadvantageous prices distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions capital expenditures or repayment of debt or make taxable distributions of capital stock or debt securities to make distributions sufficient to enable them to pay out enough of their respective reit taxable income to satisfy the reit distribution requirement and avoid corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase costs or reduce our equity further 

amounts distributed will not be available to fund the growth of our business thus compliance with the reit requirements may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan

complying with reit requirements might cause us to forgo otherwise attractive acquisition opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments 

to qualify to be taxed as reits for us federal income tax purposes simon and the subsidiary reits must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of their respective assets consist of cash cash items government securities and “real estate assets” as defined in the internal revenue code including certain mortgage loans and securities the remainder of their respective investments other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a trs generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer

additionally in general no more than 5 of the value of simon’s and the subsidiary reits’ total assets other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a trs can consist of the securities of any one issuer and no more than 20 of the value of their respective total assets can be represented by securities of one or more trss if simon or any of the subsidiary reits fails to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter simon or any such subsidiary reit must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing its reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences as a result we might be required to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive investments these actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to equity holders moreover if simon or the subsidiary reits are compelled to liquidate their investments to meet any of the asset income or distribution tests or to repay obligations to lenders simon or such subsidiaries may be unable to comply with one or more of the requirements applicable to reits or may be subject to a 100 tax on any resulting gain if such sales constitute prohibited transactions

in addition to the asset tests set forth above to qualify to be taxed as reits simon and the subsidiary reits must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of their respective income the amounts they distribute to equity holders and the ownership of their respective shares we might be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the sourceofincome or assetdiversification requirements for qualifying as reits thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments

partnership tax audit rules could have a material adverse effect on us 

the bipartisan budget act of 2015 changed the rules applicable to us federal income tax audits of partnerships under the rules among other changes and subject to certain exceptions any audit adjustment to items of income gain loss deduction or credit of a partnership and any partner’s distributive share thereof is determined and taxes interest or penalties attributable thereto could be assessed and collected at the partnership level absent available elections it is possible that a partnership in which we directly or indirectly invest could be required to pay additional taxes interest and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment and we as a direct or indirect partner of these partnerships could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes interest and penalties even though simon and the subsidiary reits as reits may not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporatelevel taxes had they owned the assets of the partnership directly the partnership tax audit rules apply to the operating partnership and its subsidiaries that are classified as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes the changes created by these rules are sweeping and accordingly there can be no assurance that these rules will not have a material adverse effect on us 

legislative administrative regulatory or other actions affecting reits including positions taken by the irs could have a material adverse effect on us and our investors 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us department of the treasury or the treasury changes to the tax laws or interpretations thereof by the irs and the treasury with or without retroactive application could materially and adversely affect us and our investors new legislation including the tcja and any technical corrections legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect the ability of simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership to qualify to be taxed as reits andor the us federal income tax consequences to us and our investors of such qualification

the tcja has significantly changed the us federal income taxation of us businesses and their owners including reits and their stockholders a change made by the tcja that could affect us and our stockholders is that it generally limits the deduction for net business interest expense in excess of 30 of a business’s adjusted taxable income except for taxpayers that engage in certain real estate businesses and elect out of this rule provided that such electing taxpayers must use an alternative depreciation system for certain property 

risks relating to joint ventures 

we have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance them 

as of december 31 2020 we owned interests in 101 incomeproducing properties with other parties of those 17 properties are included in our consolidated financial statements we account for the other 84 properties or the joint venture properties as well as our investments in hbs global properties or hbs klépierre a publicly traded parisbased real estate company and the taubman realty group llc or trg as well as our retailer investments in authentic brands group llc or abg forever 21 jc penney rue gilt groupe or rgg and sparc group using the equity method of accounting we serve as general partner or property manager for 57 of these 84 joint venture properties however certain major decisions such as approving the operating budget and selling refinancing and redeveloping the properties require the consent of the other owners of the joint venture properties for which we do not serve as general partner or property manager 23 are in our international joint ventures these international properties are managed locally by joint ventures in which we share control of the properties with our partner the other owners have participating rights that we consider substantive for purposes of determining control over the joint venture properties’ assets the remaining joint venture properties hbs klépierre trg and our joint ventures with abg forever 21 jc penney rgg and sparc group are managed by third parties

these investments and other future similar investments could involve risks that would not be present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or other owners might become bankrupt suffer a deterioration in their creditworthiness or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions if one of our partners or other owners in these investments were to become bankrupt we may be precluded from taking certain actions regarding our investments without prior court approval which at a minimum may delay the actions we would or might want to take additionally partners or other owners could have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our own business interests or goals and could be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives

these investments and other future similar investments also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions such as a sale financing or development because neither we nor our partner or other owner has full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or other owners might result in litigation or arbitration that could increase our expenses and prevent simon’s officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or other owners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we risk the possibility of being liable for the actions of our partners or other owners 

the operating partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties 

joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property which is nonrecourse to us nevertheless the joint venture’s failure to satisfy its debt obligations could result in the loss of our investment therein as of december 31 2020 the operating partnership guaranteed joint venturerelated mortgage indebtedness of 2192 million a default by a joint venture under its debt obligations would expose us to liability under a guaranty we may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests advances or partner loans although such fundings are not typically required contractually or otherwise 

risks relating to environmental matters 

as owners of real estate we can face liabilities for environmental contamination and our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful 

many of our properties contain or at one time contained asbestos containing materials or underground storage tanks primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment and as a result we may be subject to regulatory action in connection with us federal state and local laws and regulations relating to hazardous or toxic substances we may also be held liable to third parties for personal injury or property damage incurred by the parties in connection with any such substances the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances and related liabilities may be substantial and could materially and adversely affect us the presence of 

hazardous or toxic substances or the failure to remediate the related contamination may also adversely affect our ability to sell lease or redevelop a property or to borrow money using a property as collateral

although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with us federal state and local environmental laws and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances this belief is based on limited testing nearly all of our properties have been subjected to phase i or similar environmental audits these environmental audits have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us however we cannot assure you that

 

we face risks associated with climate change 

due to changes in weather patterns caused by climate change our properties in certain markets could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels over time climate change could result in volatile or decreased demand for retail space at certain of our properties or in extreme cases our inability to operate the properties at all climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of or making unavailable insurance on favorable terms or at all increasing the cost of energy at our properties or requiring us to spend funds to repair and protect our properties against such risks moreover compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change including compliance with “green” building codes may require us to make improvements to our existing properties or increase taxes and fees assessed on us or our properties

some of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters 

a number of our properties are located in areas subject to a higher risk of natural disasters such as earthquakes fires hurricanes floods tornados hail or tsunamis the occurrence of natural disasters which could become more intense and more volatile in light of climate change can adversely impact operations and developmentredevelopment projects at our properties increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms or our insurance is not adequate to cover losses from these events we could be materially and adversely affected

other factors affecting our business 

some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance 

we maintain insurance coverage with thirdparty carriers who provide a portion of the coverage for specific layers of potential losses including commercial general liability fire flood extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties in the united states the initial portion of coverage not provided by thirdparty carriers is either insured through our whollyowned captive insurance company or other financial arrangements controlled by us a third party carrier has in turn agreed to provide if required evidence of coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carrier’s policy a similar policy either written through our captive insurance company or other financial arrangements controlled by us also provides initial coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal windstorm locations

there are some types of losses including lease and other contract claims which generally are not insured or are subject to large deductibles if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue it could generate but may remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligation related to the property

we currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the united states on an “all risk” basis in the amount of up to 1 billion despite the existence of this insurance coverage any threatened or actual terrorist attacks where we operate could materially and adversely affect us

we face risks associated with security breaches through cyber ‑ attacks cyber intrusions or otherwise as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology it networks and related systems 

our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform daytoday operations and in some cases may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants we face risks associated with security breaches whether through cyberattacks or cyber intrusions over the internet malware computer viruses hardware or software corruption or failure or poor product or vendordeveloper selection including a failure of security controls incorporated into or applied to such hardware or software service provider error or failure intentional or unintentional actions by employees including the failure to follow our security protocols and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging even the most well protected information networks systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed not to be detected and in fact may not be detected accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk

the risk of a security breach or significant disruption has generally increased due to our increased reliance on technology a rise in the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks globally and the remote working environment throughout the covid19 pandemic a breach or significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our systems including our primary website could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers tenants and revenues generate third party claims cause operational disruption result in the unintended andor unauthorized public disclosure or the misappropriation of proprietary personal identifying and confidential information and require us to incur significant expenses to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues we may not be able to recover these expenses in whole or in any part from our service providers or responsible parties or their or our insurers additionally cyberattacks perpetrated against our tenants including unauthorized access to customers’ credit card data and other confidential information could diminish consumer confidence and spending and materially and adversely affect us

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain talented employees and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our business 

the success of our business depends in part on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees including our ceo who operate without the existence of employment agreements many of our senior executives have extensive experience and strong reputations in the real estate industry which aid us in identifying opportunities and negotiating with tenants our ability to attract retain and motivate talented employees could significantly impact our future performance competition for these individuals is intense and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive management team and other key employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future losing any one or more of these persons could adversely affect our business diminish our opportunities and weaken our relationships with lenders business partners existing and prospective tenants and others which could have a material adverse effect on us

provisions in simon’s charter and by ‑ laws and in the operating partnership’s partnership agreement could prevent a change of control 

simon’s charter contains a general restriction on the accumulation of shares in excess of 8 of its capital stock the charter permits the members of the simon family and related persons to own up to 18 of simon’s capital stock ownership is determined by the lower of the number of outstanding shares voting power or value controlled simon’s board of directors may by majority vote permit exceptions to those levels in circumstances where simon’s board of directors determines that simon’s ability to qualify as a reit will not be jeopardized these restrictions on ownership may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interest of simon’s stockholders or the operating partnership’s unitholders or preferred unitholders other provisions of simon’s charter and bylaws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control even if some of simon’s stockholders or the operating partnership’s unitholders or preferred unitholders deem such a change to be in their best interests these include provisions preventing holders of simon’s common stock from acting by written consent and requiring that up to four directors in the aggregate may be elected by holders of class b common stock in addition certain provisions of the operating partnership’s partnership agreement could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control these include a provision requiring the consent of a majority in interest of units in order for simon as general partner of the operating partnership to among other matters engage in a merger transaction or sell all or substantially all of its assets

we invest in real estate properties to maximize total financial return which includes both operating cash flows and capital appreciation we seek growth in earnings funds from operations or ffo and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments we seek to accomplish this growth through the following

 

we also grow by generating supplemental revenues from the following activities



 

 

we focus on high quality real estate across the retail real estate spectrum we expand or redevelop properties to enhance profitability and market share of existing assets when we believe the investment of our capital meets our riskreward criteria we selectively develop new properties in markets we believe are not adequately served by existing retail outlet properties

covid19 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus or covid19 a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide the covid19 pandemic has already had a significant negative impact on economic and market conditions around the world in 2020 and notwithstanding the fact that vaccines have started to be administered in the united states and elsewhere the pandemic continues to adversely impact economic activity in real estate the impact of the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve and governments and other authorities including where we own or hold interests in properties have imposed measures intended to control its spread including restrictions on freedom of movement group gatherings and business operations such as travel bans border closings business closures quarantines stayathome shelterinplace orders capacity limitations and social distancing measures governments and other authorities are in varying stages of lifting or modifying some of these measures however certain governments and other authorities have already been forced to and others may in the future reinstate these measures or impose new more restrictive measures if the risks or the tenants’ and consumers’ perception of the risks related to the covid19 pandemic worsen at any time although tenants and consumers have been adapting to the covid19 pandemic with tenants adding services like curbside pickup and while consumer risktolerance is evolving such adaptations and evolution may take time and there is no guarantee that retail will return to prepandemic levels even once the pandemic subsides as a result of the covid19 pandemic and these measures the company may experience material impacts including changes in the ability to recognize revenue due to changes in our assessment of the probability of collection of lease income and asset impairment charges as a result of changing cash flows generated by our properties due to certain restrictive governmental orders placed on us our domestic portfolio lost approximately 13500 shopping days during the year

as of october 7 2020 all of our domestic properties and certain of our retailer investments had reopened but we do not have certainty that additional closures in the future will not be required

united states portfolio data 

the portfolio data discussed in this overview includes the following key operating statistics ending occupancy and average base minimum rent per square foot we include acquired properties in this data beginning in the year of acquisition and remove disposed properties in the year of disposition for comparative information purposes we separate the information related to the mills from our other us operations we also do not include any information for properties located outside the united states or properties included in trg

the following table sets forth these key operating statistics for the combined us malls and premium outlets

 

 

 

ending occupancy levels and average base minimum rent per square foot ending occupancy is the percentage of gross leasable area or gla which is leased as of the last day of the reporting period we include all company owned space except for mall anchors mall majors mall freestanding and mall outlots in the calculation base minimum rent per square foot is the average base minimum rent charge in effect for the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in ending occupancy

total reported sales per square foot given the impact of covid19 and the governmental restrictions placed on us we are not presenting reported retail sales per square foot as we do not believe the trends for the period are indicative of future operating trends

current leasing activities 

during 2020 we signed 460 new leases and 1175 renewal leases excluding mall anchors and majors new development redevelopment and leases with terms of one year or less with a fixed minimum rent across our us malls and premium outlets portfolio comprising approximately 61 million square feet of which 48 million square feet related to consolidated properties during 2019 we signed 990 new leases and 1281 renewal leases with a fixed minimum rent comprising approximately 76 million square feet of which 57 million square feet related to consolidated properties the average annual initial base minimum rent for new leases was 5397 per square foot in 2020 and 5680 per square foot in 2019 with an average tenant allowance on new leases of 5101 per square foot and 4757 per square foot respectively

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

simon’s net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased 607 million due to a decrease in the net income of the operating partnership 

liquidity and capital resources 

because we own longlived incomeproducing assets our financing strategy relies primarily on longterm fixed rate debt floating rate debt comprised only 121 of our total consolidated debt at december 31 2020 we also enter into interest rate protection agreements from time to time to manage our interest rate risk we derive most of our liquidity from positive net cash flow from operations and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities that totaled 26 billion in the aggregate during 2020 the facilities and the commercial paper program provide alternative sources of liquidity as our cash needs vary from time to time borrowing capacity under these sources may be increased as discussed further below

our balance of cash and cash equivalents increased 3422 million during 2020 to 10 billion as of december 31 2020 as further discussed below

on december 31 2020 we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of approximately 67 billion under the facilities net of outstanding borrowings of 21 billion amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program of 6230 million and letters of credit of 123 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the maximum aggregate outstanding balance under the facilities was 39 billion and the weighted average outstanding balance was 18 billion the weighted average interest rate was 104 for the year ended december 31 2020 

simon has historically had access to public equity markets and the operating partnership has historically had access to private and public short and longterm unsecured debt markets and access to secured debt and private equity from institutional investors at the property level

our business model and simon’s status as a reit require us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition development and redevelopment activity and to refinance maturing debt simon may also from time to time access the equity capital markets to accomplish our business objectives we believe we have sufficient cash on hand and availability under the credit facility and the supplemental facility or together the credit facilities and the commercial paper program to address our debt maturities and capital needs through 2021

cash flows 

our net cash flow from operating activities and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities totaled 26 billion during 2020 in addition we had net proceeds from our debt financing and repayment activities of 23 billion in 2020 these activities are further discussed below under “financing and debt” during 2020 we also

 

in general we anticipate that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating expenses monthly debt service recurring capital expenditures and dividends to stockholders andor distributions to partners necessary to 

maintain simon’s reit qualification on a longterm basis at this time we do not expect the impact of covid19 to impact our ability to fund these needs for the foreseeable future however its ultimate impact is difficult to predict in addition we expect to be able to generate or obtain capital for nonrecurring capital expenditures such as acquisitions major building redevelopments and expansions as well as for scheduled principal maturities on outstanding indebtedness from the following however a severe and prolonged disruption and instability in the global financial markets including the debt and equity capital markets may affect our ability to access necessary capital

 

we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2021 and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash these cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our tenants a significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations including one due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic and restrictions intended to restrict its spread could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds from the credit facilities and commercial paper program further curtail planned capital expenditures or seek other additional sources of financing

nongaap financial measures 

industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties in part based on performance measures such as ffo diluted ffo per share noi and portfolio noi we believe that these nongaap measures are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of reits and provide a relevant basis for comparison among reits we also use these measures internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio

we determine ffo based upon the definition set forth by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” funds from operations white paper – 2018 restatement our main business includes acquiring owning operating developing and redeveloping real estate in conjunction with the rental of real estate gains and losses of assets incidental to our main business are included in ffo we determine ffo to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with gaap

 

you should understand that our computations of these nongaap measures might not be comparable to similar measures reported by other reits and that these nongaap measures

 

the following schedule reconciles total ffo to consolidated net income and for simon diluted net income per share to diluted ffo per share

 

 

the following schedule reconciles consolidated net income to noi

 

 

item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our longterm debt obligations we manage exposure to interest rate market risk through our risk management strategy by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of variable rate debt we are also exposed to foreign currency risk on financings of certain foreign operations our intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging these exposures we do not enter into either interest rate protection or foreign currency rate protection agreements for speculative purposes

we may enter into treasury lock agreements as part of anticipated issuances of senior notes upon completion of the debt issuance the cost of these instruments is recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt agreement

our future earnings cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest primarily libor based upon consolidated indebtedness and interest rates at december 31 2020 a 50 basis point increase in the market rates of interest would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 163 million and would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately 7472 million

for a description of our operational strategies and developments in our business during 2019 see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k

other policies 

the following is a discussion of our investment policies financing policies conflict of interest policies and policies with respect to certain other activities one or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote

investment policies 

while we emphasize equity real estate investments we may also provide secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers consistent with simon’s qualification as a reit however any of these investments would be subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for reit qualification these reit limitations mean that simon cannot make an investment that would cause its real estate assets to be less than 75 of its total assets simon must also derive at least 75 of its gross income directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including “rents from real property” dividends from other reits and in certain circumstances interest from certain types of temporary investments in addition simon must also derive at least 95 of its gross income from such real property investments and from dividends interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing

subject to simon’s reit limitations we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate such an investment would normally be in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties we may in the future acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies

financing policies 

because simon’s reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of its reit taxable income we regularly access the debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions develop and redevelop properties and refinance maturing debt we must comply with the covenants contained in our financing agreements that limit our ratio of debt to total assets or market value as defined for example the operating partnership’s lines of credit and the indentures for the operating partnership’s debt securities contain covenants that restrict the total amount of debt of the operating partnership to 65 or 60 in relation to certain debt of total assets as defined under the related agreements and secured debt to 50 of total assets in addition these agreements contain other covenants requiring compliance with financial 

ratios furthermore the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for the debt securities of the operating partnership we strive to maintain investment grade ratings at all times for various business reasons including their effect on our ability to access attractive capital but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so in the future

if simon’s board of directors determines to seek additional capital we may raise such capital by offering equity or incurring debt creating joint ventures with existing ownership interests in properties entering into joint venture arrangements for new development projects retaining cash flows or a combination of these methods if simon’s board of directors determines to raise equity capital it may without stockholder approval issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock simon’s board of directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital or may issue units in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate we may also raise additional capital by issuing common units of partnership interest in the operating partnership or units such securities also may include additional classes of simon’s preferred stock or preferred units of partnership interest in the operating partnership or preferred units which may be convertible into common stock or units as the case may be existing stockholders and unitholders have no preemptive right to purchase shares or units in any subsequent issuances of securities by us any issuance of equity could dilute a stockholder’s investment in simon or a limited partner’s investment in the operating partnership

we expect most future borrowings will be made through the operating partnership or its subsidiaries we might however incur borrowings through other entities that would be reloaned to the operating partnership borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings publicly and privately placed debt instruments or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties any such indebtedness may be secured or unsecured any such indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to the borrower or be crosscollateralized with other debt or may be fully or partially guaranteed by the operating partnership we issue unsecured debt securities through the operating partnership but we may issue other debt securities which may be convertible into common or preferred stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase common or preferred stock we also may sell or securitize our lease receivables although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends we currently have no expectation that we will regularly do so

the operating partnership has a 40 billion unsecured revolving credit facility or credit facility the credit facility’s initial borrowing capacity of 40 billion may be increased to 50 billion during its term the initial maturity date of the credit facility is june 30 2021 and can be extended for an additional year to june 30 2022 at our sole option subject to our continued compliance with the terms thereof the base interest rate on the credit facility is libor plus 775 basis points with an additional facility fee of 10 basis points the operating partnership also has a 35 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility or supplemental facility and together with the credit facility the credit facilities the supplemental facility’s initial borrowing capacity of 35 billion may be increased to 45 billion during its term the initial maturity date of the supplemental facility is june 30 2022 and can be extended for an additional year to june 30 2023 at our sole option subject to our continued compliance with the terms thereof the base interest rate on the supplemental facility is libor plus 775 basis points with an additional facility fee of 10 basis points the credit facilities provide for borrowings denominated in us dollars euro yen sterling canadian dollars and australian dollars

the operating partnership also has available a global unsecured commercial paper note program or commercial paper program of 20 billion or the nonus dollar equivalent thereof the operating partnership may issue unsecured commercial paper notes denominated in us dollars euro and other currencies notes issued in nonus currencies may be issued by one or more subsidiaries of the operating partnership and are guaranteed by the operating partnership notes are sold under customary terms in the us and euro commercial paper note markets and rank either by themselves or as a result of the guarantee described above pari passu with the operating partnership’s other unsecured senior indebtedness the commercial paper program is supported by the credit facilities and if necessary or appropriate we may make one or more draws under either credit facility to pay amounts outstanding from time to time on the commercial paper program

we may also finance our business through the following



 

the operating partnership may also issue units to contributors of properties or other partnership interests which may permit the contributor to defer tax gain recognition under the internal revenue code

we do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property 

mortgage financing instruments however typically limit additional indebtedness on such properties additionally the credit facilities our unsecured note indentures and other contracts may limit our ability to borrow and contain limits on mortgage indebtedness we may incur as well as certain financial covenants we must maintain

typically we invest in or form special purpose entities to assist us in obtaining secured permanent financing at attractive terms permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage loan on a single property or on a group of properties and generally requires us to provide a mortgage lien on the property or properties in favor of an institutional third party as a joint venture with a third party or as a securitized financing for securitized financings we create special purpose entities to own the properties these special purpose entities which are common in the real estate industry are structured so that they would not be consolidated in a bankruptcy proceeding involving a parent company we decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives for accounting purposes we include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness

conflict of interest policies 

we maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest simon has adopted governance principles governing the function conduct selection orientation and duties of its subsidiaries and simon’s board of directors and the company as well as written charters for each of the standing committees of simon’s board of directors in addition simon’s board of directors has a code of business conduct and ethics which applies to all of its officers directors and employees and those of its subsidiaries at least a majority of the members of simon’s board of directors must qualify and do qualify as independent under the listing standards of the new york stock exchange or nyse and cannot be affiliated with the simon family who are significant stockholders in simon andor unitholders in the operating partnership in addition the audit and compensation committees of simon’s board of directors are comprised entirely of independent members who meet the additional independence and financial expert requirements of the nyse as required 

the sale by the operating partnership of any property that it owns may have an adverse tax impact on the simon family or other limited partners of the operating partnership any transaction between us and the simon family including property acquisitions service and property management agreements and retail space leases must be approved by the company’s audit committee

in order to avoid any conflict of interest the simon charter requires that at least threefourths of simon’s independent directors must authorize and require the operating partnership to sell any property it owns any such sale is subject to applicable agreements with third parties a noncompetition agreement executed by herbert simon simon’s chairman emeritus and a noncompetition agreement executed by david simon simon’s chairman chief executive officer and president which remains in effect notwithstanding the expiration of david simon’s employment agreement in 2019 contain covenants limiting their ability to participate in certain shopping center activities

policies with respect to certain other activities 

we intend to make investments which are consistent with simon’s qualification as a reit unless simon’s board of directors determines that it is no longer in simon’s best interests to so qualify as a reit simon’s board of directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the reit requirements simon has authority to issue shares of its capital stock or other securities in exchange for property we also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire simon’s shares the operating partnership’s units or any other securities on february 13 2017 simon’s board of directors authorized a twoyear extension of the previously authorized 20 billion common stock repurchase plan or the repurchase program through march 31 2019 and on february 11 2019 simons board of directors authorized a new common stock repurchase plan under the new program the company may purchase up to 20 billion of its common stock during the twoyear period ending february 11 2021 under the repurchase program simon may repurchase the shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at december 31 2019 we had remaining authority to repurchase 16 billion of common stock simon may also issue shares of its common stock or 

pay cash at its option to holders of units in future periods upon exercise of such holders’ rights under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership our policy prohibits us from making any loans to the directors or executive officers of simon for any purpose we may make loans to the joint ventures in which we participate additionally we may make or buy interests in loans secured by real estate properties owned by others or make investments in companies that own real estate assets

competition 

the retail real estate industry is dynamic and competitive we compete with numerous merchandise distribution channels including malls outlet centers communitylifestyle centers and other shopping centers in the united states and abroad we also compete with internet retailing sites and catalogs which provide retailers with distribution options beyond existing brick and mortar retail properties the existence of competitive alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we can obtain this results in competition for both the tenants to occupy the properties that we develop and manage as well as for the acquisition of prime sites including land for development and operating properties we believe that there are numerous factors that make our properties highly desirable to retailers including

 item 1a risk factors 

the following factors among others could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10 k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations funds from operations or ffo and prospects which we refer to herein as a material adverse effect on us or as materially and adversely affecting us and you should carefully consider them additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which are currently not believed to be material may also affect our actual results we may update these factors in our future periodic reports 

risks relating to retail operations 

conditions that adversely affect the general retail environment could materially and adversely affect us 

our concentration in the retail real estate market – our primary source of revenue is retail tenants – means that we could be materially and adversely affected by conditions that materially and adversely affect the retail environment generally including without limitation

 

additionally a portion of our lease income is derived from overage rents based on sales over a stated base amount that directly depend on the sales volume of our retail tenants accordingly declines in our tenants’ sales performance could reduce the income produced by our properties

some of our properties depend on anchor stores or other large nationally recognized tenants to attract shoppers and we could be materially and adversely affected by the loss of one or more of these anchors or tenants 

our properties are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally recognized tenants certain of our anchors and other tenants have ceased their operations downsized their brickandmortar presence or failed to comply with their contractual obligations to us and others 

for example among department stores and other national retailers — often referred to as “big box” stores — corporate merger or consolidation activity typically results in the closure of duplicate or geographically overlapping store 

locations further sustained adverse pressure on the results of our department stores and other national retailers may have a similarly sustained adverse impact upon our own results certain department stores and other national retailers have experienced and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future given uncertainty with respect to current and future macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence levels considerable decreases in customer traffic in their retail stores increased competition from alternative retail options such as those accessible via the internet and other forms of pressure on their business models as pressure on these department stores and other national retailers increases their ability to maintain their stores meet their obligations both to us and to their external lenders and suppliers withstand takeover attempts or avoid bankruptcy andor liquidation may be impaired and result in closures of their stores or their seeking of a lease modification with us any lease modification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and could decrease current or future effective rents or expense recovery charges other tenants may be entitled to modify the economic or other terms of or terminate their existing leases with us in the event of such closures

if a department store or large nationally recognized tenant were to close its stores at our properties we may experience difficulty and delay and incur significant expense in retenanting the space as well as in leasing spaces in areas adjacent to the vacant store at attractive rates or at all additionally department store or tenant closures may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sales at our properties if the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to the closing of anchor stores or other national retailers adverse economic conditions or other reasons tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges in the event of any default by a tenant we may not be able to fully recover andor may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our leases with such parties

we face potential adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies 

bankruptcy filings by retailers can occur regularly in the course of our operations and in recent years a number of companies in the retail industry including certain of our tenants have declared bankruptcy if a tenant files for bankruptcy the tenant may have the right to reject and terminate one or more of its leases with us and we cannot be sure that it will affirm one or more of its leases and continue to make rental payments to us in a timely manner a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants would generally prohibit us from evicting this tenant and bar all efforts by us to collect prebankruptcy debts from that tenant or from their property unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court in addition we cannot evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy if a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy all prebankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full if a lease is rejected the unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims and there are restrictions under bankruptcy laws that limit the amount of the claim we can make if a lease is rejected as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold in addition we may make lease modifications either pre or postbankruptcy for certain tenants undergoing significant financial distress in order for them to continue as a going concern furthermore we may be required to incur significant expense in retenanting the space formerly leased to the bankrupt tenant we continually seek to release vacant spaces resulting from tenant terminations the bankruptcy of a tenant particularly an anchor tenant or a national tenant with multiple locations may require a substantial redevelopment of its space the success of which cannot be assured and may make the retenanting of its space difficult and costly any such bankruptcies also make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the space at the affected property or properties future tenant bankruptcies may strain our resources and impact our ability to successfully execute our releasing strategy and could materially and adversely affect us

we face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably 

our properties compete with other forms of retailing such as ecommerce websites as well as other retail properties the increased popularity of digital and mobile technologies has accelerated the transition of a percentage of market share from shopping at physical stores to webbased shopping we could be materially and adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in adapting our business to evolving consumer purchasing habits competition may also come from a variety of other retail formats such as malls outlet centers communitylifestyle centers and other shopping centers both existing and future development and redevelopmentexpansion projects as well as ecommerce the presence of competitive alternatives affects our ability to lease space and puts downward pressure on the rents we can charge our tenants new construction redevelopments and expansions at competing sites could also negatively affect our properties

we also compete with other major real estate investors and developers for attractive investment opportunities and prime development sites competition for the acquisition of existing properties and development sites may result in 

increased purchase prices and may adversely affect our ability to make attractive investments on favorable terms or at all in addition we compete with other retail property companies for tenants and qualified management

vacant space at our properties could materially and adversely affect us 

certain of our properties have had vacant space available for prospective tenants and those properties may continue to experience and other properties may commence experiencing such oversupply in the future among other causes 1 there has been an increased number of bankruptcies of anchor stores and other national retailers as well as store closures and 2 there has been lower demand from retail tenants for space due to certain retailers increasing their use of ecommerce websites to distribute their merchandise as a result of the increased bargaining power of creditworthy retail tenants there is downward pressure on our rental rates and occupancy levels and this increased bargaining power may also result in us having to increase our spend on tenant improvements and potentially make other lease modifications in order to attract or retain tenants any of which in the aggregate could materially and adversely affect us

we may not be able to lease newly developed properties or renew leases and relet space at existing properties 

we may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants that generates optimal customer traffic also when leases for our existing properties expire the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms if we elect to pursue a “mixed use” redevelopment we expose ourselves to risks associated with each nonretail use eg office residential hotel and entertainment and the performance of our retail tenants in such properties may be negatively impacted by delays in opening andor the performance of such nonretail uses to the extent that our leasing goals are not achieved we could be materially and adversely affected

risks relating to real estate investments and operations 

our international activities may subject us to risks that are different from or greater than those associated with our domestic operations 

as of december 31 2019 we held interests in consolidated and joint venture properties that operate in austria canada france italy germany japan malaysia mexico the netherlands south korea and the united kingdom we also have an equity stake in klépierre a publicly traded european real estate company which operates in 15 countries in europe accordingly our operating results and the value of our international operations may be impacted by any unhedged movements in the foreign currencies in which those operations transact and in which our net investment in those international operations is held while we occasionally enter into hedging agreements to manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates these agreements may not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely 

we may pursue additional investment ownership development and redevelopmentexpansion opportunities outside the united states such international activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our domestic properties and operations these risks include but are not limited to



 

our international activities represented approximately 81 of consolidated net income and 93 of our net operating income or noi for the year ended december 31 2019 to the extent that we expand our international activities the above risks could increase in significance which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us

we face risks associated with the acquisition development redevelopment and expansion of properties 

we regularly acquire and develop new properties and redevelop and expand existing properties and these activities are subject to various risks we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition development or redevelopmentexpansion opportunities in addition newly acquired developed or redevelopedexpanded properties may not perform as well as expected impacting our anticipated return on investment we are subject to other risks in connection with any acquisition development and redevelopmentexpansion activities including the following

 

if a development or redevelopmentexpansion project is unsuccessful either because it is not meeting our expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project planning we could lose our investment in the project further if we guarantee the property’s financing our loss could exceed our investment in the project

in the event that these risks were realized at the same time at multiple properties we could be materially and adversely affected

real estate investments are relatively illiquid 

our properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets these investments are relatively illiquid as a result our ability to sell one or more of our properties or investments in real estate in response to any changes in economic industry or other conditions may be limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability and terms of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand for space that are beyond our control if we want to sell a property we cannot assure you that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or at all or that the sales price of a property will be attractive at the relevant time or exceed the carrying value of our investment moreover if a property is mortgaged we may not be able to obtain a release of the lien on that property without the payment of the associated debt andor a substantial prepayment penalty which could restrict our ability to dispose of the property even though the sale might otherwise be desirable

risks relating to debt and the financial markets 

we have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations 

as of december 31 2019 our consolidated mortgages and unsecured indebtedness excluding related premium discount and debt issuance costs totaled 242 billion as a result of this indebtedness we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows for debt service including selected repayment at scheduled maturities which limits our ability to use those cash flows to fund the growth of our business we are also subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flows from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service or that we will be able to refinance such indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the applicable property such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants 

cause a reduction in the income from the property our indebtedness could also have other adverse consequences on us including reducing our access to capital or increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic industry and market conditions in addition if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value if any of the foregoing occurs we could be materially and adversely affected

the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that might affect our ability to operate freely 

we have a variety of unsecured debt including the credit facilities senior unsecured notes and commercial paper and secured property level debt certain of the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain covenants including among other things limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured indebtedness sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and certain acquisitions in addition certain of the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain financial covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios including certain coverage ratios these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous to us in addition our ability to comply with these provisions might be affected by events beyond our control failure to comply with any of our financing covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate the related indebtedness as well as other of our indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on us

disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements 

we depend on external financings principally debt financings to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt our access to financing depends on our credit ratings the willingness of lending institutions and other debt investors to grant credit to us and conditions in the capital markets in general an economic recession may cause extreme volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets we rely upon the credit facilities as sources of funding for numerous transactions our access to these funds is dependent upon the ability of each of the participants to the credit facilities to meet their funding commitments to us when markets are volatile access to capital and credit markets could be disrupted over an extended period of time and one or more financial institutions may not have the available capital to meet their previous commitments to us the failure of one or more participants to the credit facilities to meet their funding commitments to us could have a material adverse effect on us including as a result of making it difficult to obtain the financing we may need for future growth andor meeting our debt service requirements we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for the future growth of our business or to meet our debt service requirements or that a sufficient amount of financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all

adverse changes in our credit ratings could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

the operating partnership’s outstanding senior unsecured notes the credit facilities the commercial paper program and simon’s preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios financial condition and prospects and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to us and our industry and the economic outlook in general our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund the growth of our business an adverse change in our credit ratings including actual changes and changes in outlook or even the initiation of a review of our credit ratings that could result in an adverse change could have a material adverse effect on us

an increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt on attractive terms or at all our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 8651 million of outstanding consolidated indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates and we may incur more variable rate indebtedness in the future if interest rates increase then so would the interest costs on our unhedged variable rate debt which could adversely affect our cash flows and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders further rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or significantly increase our future interest expense

we selectively manage our exposure to interest rate risk by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap all or a portion of our variable rate debt in addition we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and other terms are appropriate our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful

our use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations or that we could be required to fund our contractual payment obligations under such arrangements in relatively large amounts or on short notice developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs

we may be adversely affected by developments in the london interbank offered rate libor market changes in the methods by which libor is determined or the use of alternative reference rates 

as of december 31 2019 approximately 24 or 573 million of our debt outstanding was indexed to libor in july 2017 the uk financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates libor announced its intention to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 accordingly there is considerable uncertainty regarding the publication of libor beyond 2021 the federal reserve board convened the alternative reference rates committee “arrc” to identify a set of alternative reference rates for possible use as market benchmarks based on the arrc’s recommendation the federal reserve bank of new york began publishing the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” and two other alternative rates beginning in april 2018 since then certain derivative products and debt securities tied to sofr have been introduced and a number of industry groups are developing transition plans to sofr as the new market benchmark 

we are not able to predict whether libor will actually cease to be available after 2021 or whether sofr will become the market benchmark in its place any changes announced or adopted by the fca or other authorities or institutions in the methods used for determining libor or the transition from libor to a successor benchmark may result in among other things a sudden or prolonged increase in libor a delay in the publication of libor higher interest obligations arising from such successor benchmark and changes in the rules or methodologies for determining libor in the overall debt capital markets which may discourage market participants from continuing to administer or to participate in variable rate debt tied to libor or such successor benchmark if libor as determined in accordance with the terms of our particular debt is no longer available whether before or after 2021 the interest rates on such debt would be determined using various alternative methods any of which may result in interest obligations which are more than or do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on such debt if libor was available in its current form as a result there can be no assurance that any of the aforementioned developments or changes will not result in financial market disruptions significant increases in benchmark interest rates substantially higher financing costs or a shortage of available debt financing any of which could have an adverse effect on us which currently would be limited by our relatively low exposure to variable rate liborbased debt

risks relating to income taxes 

simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership have elected to be taxed as reits in the united states the failure to maintain simon’s or the subsidiary reits’ qualifications as reits or changes in applicable tax laws or regulations could result in adverse tax consequences 

in the united states simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership have elected to be taxed as reits under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code we believe that simon and these subsidiaries or the subsidiary reits have been organized and have operated in a manner which allows them to qualify for taxation as reits under the internal revenue code we intend to continue to operate in this manner however qualification and taxation as reits depend upon the ability of simon and the subsidiary reits to satisfy several requirements some of which are outside our control including tests related to our annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various reit qualification tests required by the internal revenue code are highly technical and complex accordingly there can be no assurance that simon or any of the subsidiary reits has operated in accordance with these requirements or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit

if simon or any of the subsidiary reits fail to comply with those provisions simon or any such subsidiary reit may be subject to monetary penalties or ultimately to possible disqualification as reits if such events occur and if available relief provisions do not apply



 

any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for among other things our operations and distributions to stockholders in addition if simon fails to qualify as a reit it will not be required to make distributions to our stockholders moreover a failure by any subsidiary of the operating partnership that has elected to be taxed as a reit to qualify as a reit would also cause simon to fail to qualify as a reit and the same adverse consequences would apply to it and its stockholders failure by simon or any of the subsidiary reits to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital which could materially and adversely affect us

additionally we are subject to certain incomebased taxes both domestically and internationally and other taxes including state and local taxes franchise taxes and withholding taxes on dividends from certain of our international investments we currently follow local tax laws and regulations in various domestic and international jurisdictions should these laws or regulations change the amount of taxes we pay may increase accordingly

if the operating partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes we would cease to qualify as a reit and suffer other adverse consequences 

we believe that the operating partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes as a partnership the operating partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income instead each of its partners including us is allocated and may be required to pay tax with respect to such partner’s share of its income we cannot assure you that the internal revenue service or the irs will not challenge the status of the operating partnership or any other subsidiary partnership or limited liability company in which we own an interest as a disregarded entity or partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership or any such other subsidiary as an entity taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to reits and accordingly we would likely cease to qualify as a reit also the failure of the operating partnership or any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability company to qualify as a disregarded entity or partnership for applicable income tax purposes could cause it to become subject to federal and state corporate income tax which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners or members including us

our ownership of trss is subject to certain restrictions and we will be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our trss are not conducted on arm’slength terms 

we own securities in taxable reit subsidiaries or trss and may acquire securities in additional trss in the future a trs is a corporation other than a reit in which a reit directly or indirectly holds stock and that has made a joint election with such reit to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary if a trs owns more than 35 of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation such other corporation will also be treated as a trs other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities a trs may generally engage in any business including the provision of customary or noncustomary services to tenants of its parent reit a trs is subject to federal income tax as a regular c corporation in addition a 100 excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a trs and its parent reit that are not conducted on an arm’s length basis

a reit’s ownership of securities of a trs is not subject to the 5 or 10 asset tests applicable to reits not more than 25 of the value of simon’s or any subsidiary reit’s total assets may be represented by securities including securities of trss other than those securities includable in the 75 asset test and not more than 20 of the value of our total assets or the assets of any subsidiary reit may be represented by securities of trss we anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of any trs and other nonqualifying assets that simon or each such subsidiary reit owns will be less than 25 or 20 as applicable of the value of simon’s or such subsidiary’s total assets and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable ownership limitations in addition we intend to structure transactions with any trss that we own to ensure that they are entered into on arm’s length terms to avoid incurring the 100 excise tax described above there can be no assurance however that we will be able to comply with the above limitations or to avoid application of the 100 excise tax discussed above

dividends payable by reits generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends which may negatively affect the value of our shares 

income from “qualified dividends” payable to us stockholders that are individuals trusts and estates are generally subject to tax at preferential rates currently at a maximum federal rate of 20 dividends payable by reits however generally are not eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income under the tax cuts and jobs act or the tcja however us stockholders that are individuals trusts and estates generally may deduct up to 20 of the ordinary dividends eg dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income received from a reit for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by reits generally to 296 assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37 maximum rate such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income accordingly investors who are individuals trusts and estates may perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could materially and adversely affect the value of the shares of reits including the per share trading price of our common stock

the tax imposed on reits engaging in “prohibited transactions” may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for us federal income tax purposes 

a reit’s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100 penalty tax in general prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the irs would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors

reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan 

in order for simon and the subsidiary reits to qualify to be taxed as reits and assuming that certain other requirements are also satisfied simon and each such subsidiary reit generally must distribute at least 90 of their respective reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains to their respective equity holders each year to this point simon and each such subsidiary reit have historically distributed at least 100 of its taxable income and thereby avoided income tax altogether to the extent that simon or any such subsidiary reit satisfies this distribution requirement and qualifies for taxation as a reit but distributes less than 100 of its reit taxable income simon or such subsidiary will be subject to us federal corporate income tax on its undistributed net taxable income and could be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that is distributed to equity holders in a calendar year is less than the minimum required distribution amount we intend to make distributions to the equity holders of simon and the subsidiary reits to comply with the reit requirements of the internal revenue code

from time to time simon and the subsidiary reits might generate taxable income greater than their respective cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments if simon or the subsidiary reits do not have other funds available in these situations simon or such subsidiaries could be required to access capital on unfavorable terms the receipt of which cannot be assured sell assets at disadvantageous prices distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions capital expenditures or repayment of debt or make taxable distributions of capital stock or debt securities to make distributions sufficient to enable them to pay out enough of their respective reit taxable income to satisfy the reit distribution requirement and avoid corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase costs or reduce our equity further amounts distributed will not be available to fund the growth of our business thus compliance with the reit requirements may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan

complying with reit requirements might cause us to forgo otherwise attractive acquisition opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments 

to qualify to be taxed as reits for us federal income tax purposes simon and the subsidiary reits must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of their respective assets consist of cash cash items government securities and “real estate assets” as defined in the internal revenue code including certain mortgage loans and securities the remainder of their respective investments other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a trs generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one 

issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer

additionally in general no more than 5 of the value of simon’s and the subsidiary reits’ total assets other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a trs can consist of the securities of any one issuer and no more than 20 of the value of their respective total assets can be represented by securities of one or more trss if simon or any of the subsidiary reits fails to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter simon or any such subsidiary reit must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing its reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences as a result we might be required to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive investments these actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to equity holders moreover if simon or the subsidiary reits are compelled to liquidate their investments to meet any of the asset income or distribution tests or to repay obligations to lenders simon or such subsidiaries may be unable to comply with one or more of the requirements applicable to reits or may be subject to a 100 tax on any resulting gain if such sales constitute prohibited transactions

in addition to the asset tests set forth above to qualify to be taxed as reits simon and the subsidiary reits must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of their respective income the amounts they distribute to equity holders and the ownership of their respective shares we might be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the sourceofincome or assetdiversification requirements for qualifying as reits thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments

partnership tax audit rules could have a material adverse effect on us 

the bipartisan budget act of 2015 changed the rules applicable to us federal income tax audits of partnerships under the rules among other changes and subject to certain exceptions any audit adjustment to items of income gain loss deduction or credit of a partnership and any partner’s distributive share thereof is determined and taxes interest or penalties attributable thereto could be assessed and collected at the partnership level absent available elections it is possible that a partnership in which we directly or indirectly invest could be required to pay additional taxes interest and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment and we as a direct or indirect partner of these partnerships could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes interest and penalties even though simon and the subsidiary reits as reits may not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporatelevel taxes had they owned the assets of the partnership directly the partnership tax audit rules apply to the operating partnership and its subsidiaries that are classified as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes the changes created by these rules are sweeping and accordingly there can be no assurance that these rules will not have a material adverse effect on us 

legislative administrative regulatory or other actions affecting reits including positions taken by the irs could have a material adverse effect on us and our investors 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us department of the treasury or the treasury changes to the tax laws or interpretations thereof by the irs and the treasury with or without retroactive application could materially and adversely affect us and our investors new legislation including the tcja and any technical corrections legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect the ability of simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership to qualify to be taxed as reits andor the us federal income tax consequences to us and our investors of such qualification

the tcja has significantly changed the us federal income taxation of us businesses and their owners including reits and their stockholders a change made by the tcja that could affect us and our stockholders is that it generally limits the deduction for net business interest expense in excess of 30 of a business’s adjusted taxable income except for taxpayers that engage in certain real estate businesses and elect out of this rule provided that such electing taxpayers must use an alternative depreciation system for certain property 

risks relating to joint ventures 

we have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance them 

as of december 31 2019 we owned interests in 100 incomeproducing properties with other parties of those 18 properties are included in our consolidated financial statements we account for the other 82 properties or the joint venture properties as well as our investments in klépierre a publicly traded parisbased real estate company aéropostale authentic brands group llc or abg hbs global properties or hbs and rue gilt groupe or rgg using the equity 

method of accounting we serve as general partner or property manager for 57 of these 82 joint venture properties however certain major decisions such as approving the operating budget and selling refinancing and redeveloping the properties require the consent of the other owners of the joint venture properties for which we do not serve as general partner or property manager 21 are in our international joint ventures these international properties are managed locally by joint ventures in which we share control of the properties with our partner the other owners have participating rights that we consider substantive for purposes of determining control over the joint venture properties’ assets the remaining joint venture properties klépierre and our joint ventures with aéropostale abg hbs and rgg are managed by third parties

these investments and other future similar investments could involve risks that would not be present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or other owners might become bankrupt suffer a deterioration in their creditworthiness or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions if one of our partners or other owners in these investments were to become bankrupt we may be precluded from taking certain actions regarding our investments without prior court approval which at a minimum may delay the actions we would or might want to take additionally partners or other owners could have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our own business interests or goals and could be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives

these investments and other future similar investments also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions such as a sale financing or development because neither we nor our partner or other owner has full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or other owners might result in litigation or arbitration that could increase our expenses and prevent simon’s officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or other owners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we risk the possibility of being liable for the actions of our partners or other owners 

the operating partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties 

joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property which is nonrecourse to us nevertheless the joint venture’s failure to satisfy its debt obligations could result in the loss of our investment therein as of december 31 2019 the operating partnership guaranteed joint venturerelated mortgage indebtedness of 2148 million of which we have a right of recovery from our joint venture partners of 108 million a default by a joint venture under its debt obligations would expose us to liability under a guaranty we may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests advances or partner loans although such fundings are not typically required contractually or otherwise

risks relating to environmental matters 

as owners of real estate we can face liabilities for environmental contamination 

us federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require us as a current or previous owner or operator of real property to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at a property or at impacted neighboring properties these laws often impose liability regardless of whether the property owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances and under certain circumstances this liability can be joint and several such that one party is held responsible for the entire obligation these laws and regulations also may require the abatement or removal of asbestos containing materials and other hazardous building materials in the event of damage demolition or renovation reconstruction or expansion of a property and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air those laws and regulations also govern the installation maintenance and removal of underground storage tanks used to store waste oils or other petroleum products many of our properties contain or at one time contained asbestos containing materials or underground storage tanks primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment we may be subject to regulatory action in connection with any such laws and regulations and may also be held liable to third parties for personal injury or property damage incurred by the parties in connection with any such hazardous or toxic substances the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances and related liabilities may be substantial and could materially and adversely affect us the presence of hazardous or toxic substances or the failure to remediate the related contamination may also adversely affect our ability to sell lease or redevelop a property or to borrow money using a property as collateral

our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful 

although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with us federal state and local environmental laws and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances this belief is based on limited testing nearly all of our properties have been subjected to phase i or similar environmental audits these environmental audits have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us however we cannot assure you that

 

we face risks associated with climate change 

to the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns our properties in certain markets could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels over time these conditions could result in volatile or decreased demand for retail space at certain of our properties or in extreme cases our inability to operate the properties at all climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of or making unavailable insurance on favorable terms or at all increasing the cost of energy at our properties or requiring us to spend funds to repair and protect our properties against such risks moreover compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change including compliance with “green” building codes may require us to make improvements to our existing properties or increase taxes and fees assessed on us or our properties

some of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters 

a number of our properties are located in areas subject to a higher risk of natural disasters such as earthquakes fires hurricanes floods tornados or tsunamis the occurrence of natural disasters can adversely impact operations and developmentredevelopment projects at our properties increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms or our insurance is not adequate to cover losses from these events we could be materially and adversely affected

other factors affecting our business 

some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance 

we maintain insurance coverage with thirdparty carriers who provide a portion of the coverage for specific layers of potential losses including commercial general liability fire flood extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties in the united states the initial portion of coverage not provided by thirdparty carriers is either insured through our whollyowned captive insurance company or other financial arrangements controlled by us a third party carrier has in turn agreed to provide if required evidence of coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carrier’s policy a similar policy either written through our captive insurance company or other financial arrangements controlled by us also provides initial coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal windstorm locations

there are some types of losses including lease and other contract claims which generally are not insured or are subject to large deductibles if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue it could generate but may remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligation related to the property

we currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the united states on an “all risk” basis in the amount of up to 1 billion despite the existence of this insurance coverage any threatened or actual terrorist attacks where we operate could materially and adversely affect us

we face risks associated with security breaches through cyber ‑ attacks cyber intrusions or otherwise as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology it networks and related systems 

our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform daytoday operations and in some cases may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants we face risks associated with security breaches whether through cyberattacks or cyber intrusions over the internet malware computer viruses hardware or software corruption or failure or poor product or vendordeveloper selection including a failure of security controls incorporated into or applied to such hardware or software service provider error or failure intentional or unintentional actions by employees including the failure to follow our security protocols and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging even the most well protected information networks systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed not to be detected and in fact may not be detected accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk

the risk of a security breach or significant disruption has generally increased due to our increased reliance on technology and due to a rise in the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks globally a breach or significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our systems including our primary website could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers tenants and revenues generate third party claims cause operational disruption result in the unintended andor unauthorized public disclosure or the misappropriation of proprietary personal identifying and confidential information and require us to incur significant expenses to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues we may not be able to recover these expenses in whole or in any part from our service providers or responsible parties or their or our insurers additionally cyberattacks perpetrated against our tenants including unauthorized access to customers’ credit card data and other confidential information could diminish consumer confidence and spending and materially and adversely affect us

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain talented employees and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our business 

the success of our business depends in part on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees and our ability to attract retain and motivate talented employees could significantly impact our future performance competition for these individuals is intense and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive management team and other key employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on us

provisions in simon’s charter and by ‑ laws and in the operating partnership’s partnership agreement could prevent a change of control 

simon’s charter contains a general restriction on the accumulation of shares in excess of 8 of its capital stock the charter permits the members of the simon family and related persons to own up to 18 of simon’s capital stock ownership is determined by the lower of the number of outstanding shares voting power or value controlled simon’s board of directors may by majority vote permit exceptions to those levels in circumstances where simon’s board of directors determines that simon’s ability to qualify as a reit will not be jeopardized these restrictions on ownership may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interest of simon’s stockholders or the operating partnership’s unitholders or preferred unitholders other provisions of simon’s charter and bylaws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control even if some of simon’s stockholders or the operating partnership’s unitholders or preferred unitholders deem such a change to be in their best interests these include provisions preventing holders of simon’s common stock from acting by written consent and requiring that up to four directors in the aggregate may be elected by holders of class b common stock in addition certain provisions of the operating partnership’s partnership agreement could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control these include a provision requiring the consent of a majority in interest of units in order for simon as general partner of the operating partnership to among other matters engage in a merger transaction or sell all or substantially all of its assets

the united kingdom’s departure from the european union could have a material adverse effect on us 

following a national referendum and enactment of legislation by the government of the united kingdom the united kingdom formally withdrew from the european union on january 31 2020 and entered into a transition period during which it will continue its ongoing and complex negotiations with the european union relating to the future trading relationship between the parties significant political and economic uncertainty remains about whether the terms of the relationship will differ materially from the terms before withdrawal as well as about the possibility that a socalled “no deal” separation will occur if negotiations are not completed by the end of the transition period 

these developments or the perception that any of them could occur may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets and may significantly reduce global market liquidity restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets or restrict our access to capital any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and reduce the price of our securities

we currently hold and may acquire additional equity interests in properties located in the united kingdom and europe as well as other investments that are denominated in pounds sterling and euro in addition our operating partnership and its subsidiaries have issued and may issue in the future senior unsecured notes denominated in euro any of the effects of brexit described above and others we cannot anticipate could have a material adverse effect on us including the value of our properties and investments and our potential growth in europe as well as on our tenants’ businesses and could amplify the currency risks faced by us

any failure to comply with anticorruption laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect us 

we are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business for example we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa which generally prohibits us companies or persons and any individuals or entities acting on their behalf from offering or making improper payments or providing benefits to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business we are also subject to various other antibribery anticorruption and international trade laws in the us and certain foreign countries such as the uk bribery act there is a risk that our employees business partners and other third parties could violate these laws and we could be sanctioned or held liable for actions taken by our employees business partners and other third parties with respect to our business any allegations settlements or violations regarding such laws could negatively impact our reputation and we could incur significant expenses in investigating any potential violation and face severe criminal or civil sanctions andor fines as a result of violations or settlements any of which could materially and adversely affect us

we generate the majority of our lease income from retail dining entertainment and other tenants including consideration received from

 

revenues of our management company after intercompany eliminations consist primarily of management fees that are typically based upon the revenues of the property being managed

we invest in real estate properties to maximize total financial return which includes both operating cash flows and capital appreciation we seek growth in earnings funds from operations or ffo and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments we seek to accomplish this growth through the following

 

we also grow by generating supplemental revenues from the following activities



 

 

we focus on high quality real estate across the retail real estate spectrum we expand or redevelop properties to enhance profitability and market share of existing assets when we believe the investment of our capital meets our riskreward criteria we selectively develop new properties in markets we believe are not adequately served by existing retail outlet properties

we routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio our international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk

to support our growth we employ a threefold capital strategy

 

we consider ffo net operating income or noi portfolio noi and comparable property noi noi for properties owned and operated in both periods under comparison to be key measures of operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or gaap we use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure are included below in this discussion

results overview 

diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per unit decreased 106 during 2019 to 681 as compared to 787 in 2018 the decrease in diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per unit was primarily attributable to

 

solid core business fundamentals during 2019 were primarily driven by strong leasing activity portfolio noi grew by 14 in 2019 as compared to 2018 comparable property noi grew 14 for our portfolio of us malls premium outlets and the mills total reported sales per square foot or psf increased 48 to 693 psf at december 31 2019 from 661 psf at december 31 2018 for our us malls and premium outlets average base minimum rent for us malls and premium outlets increased 08 to 5459 psf as of december 31 2019 from 5418 psf as of december 31 2018 leasing spreads in our us malls and premium outlets were positive as we were able to lease available square feet at higher rents resulting in an openclose leasing spread based on total tenant payments — base minimum rent plus common area maintenance of 783 psf 6239 openings compared to 5456 closings as of december 31 2019 representing a 144 increase ending occupancy for our us malls and premium outlets decreased 08 to 951 as of december 31 2019 from 959 as of december 31 2018

our effective overall borrowing rate at december 31 2019 on our consolidated indebtedness decreased 19 basis points to 316 as compared to 335 at december 31 2018 this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the effective overall borrowing rate on variable rate debt of 56 basis points 261 at december 31 2019 as compared to 317 at december 31 2018 partially offset by an increase in the effective overall borrowing rate on fixed rate debt of nine basis points 346 at december 31 2019 as compared to 337 at december 31 2018 the weighted average years to maturity of our consolidated indebtedness was 74 years and 64 years at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively

our financing activity for the year ended december 31 2019 included

 

united states portfolio data 

the portfolio data discussed in this overview includes the following key operating statistics ending occupancy average base minimum rent per square foot and total sales per square foot for our domestic assets we include acquired properties in this data beginning in the year of acquisition and remove disposed properties in the year of disposition for comparative information purposes we separate the information related to the mills from our other us operations we also do not include any information for properties located outside the united states

the following table sets forth these key operating statistics for the combined us malls and premium outlets

 

 

 

ending occupancy levels and average base minimum rent per square foot ending occupancy is the percentage of gross leasable area or gla which is leased as of the last day of the reporting period we include all company owned space except for mall anchors mall majors mall freestanding and mall outlots in the calculation base minimum rent per square foot is the average base minimum rent charge in effect for the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in ending occupancy

total reported sales per square foot total sales include total reported retail tenant sales on a trailing 12month basis at owned gla for mall stores with less than 10000 square feet in the malls and the mills and stores with less than 20000 square feet in the premium outlets retail sales at owned gla affect revenue and profitability levels because sales determine the amount of minimum rent that can be charged the percentage rent realized and the recoverable expenses common area maintenance real estate taxes etc that tenants can afford to pay

current leasing activities 

during 2019 we signed 990 new leases and 1281 renewal leases excluding mall anchors and majors new development redevelopment and leases with terms of one year or less with a fixed minimum rent across our us malls and premium outlets portfolio comprising approximately 76 million square feet of which 57 million square feet related to consolidated properties during 2018 we signed 900 new leases and 1183 renewal leases with a fixed minimum rent comprising approximately 71 million square feet of which 53 million square feet related to consolidated properties the average annual initial base minimum rent for new leases was 5680 per square foot in 2019 and 5729 per square foot in 2018 with an average tenant allowance on new leases of 4757 per square foot and 5421 per square foot respectively

japan data 

the following are selected key operating statistics for our premium outlets in japan the information used to prepare these statistics has been supplied by the managing venture partner

 ​ 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

in addition to the activities discussed above and in “results overview” the following acquisitions dispositions and openings of joint venture properties affected our income from unconsolidated entities in the comparative periods



 

for the purposes of the following comparisons between the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 and the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 the above transactions are referred to as the property transactions in the following discussions of our results of operations “comparable” refers to properties we owned and operated in both years in the year to year comparisons

during the third quarter of 2017 two of our whollyowned properties located in puerto rico sustained significant damage as a result of hurricane maria for purposes of the below comparisons these properties are also included in the property transactions due to the fact they were not open for business during the entirety of the periods being compared

year ended december 31 2019 vs year ended december 31 2018 

lease income increased 854 million during 2019 of which the property transactions accounted for 332 million of the increase comparable lease income increased 522 million or 10 due to increases in fixed minimum lease and cam consideration recorded on a straightline basis as a result of the adoption of asc 842 

total other income increased 279 million primarily due to a 680 million increase related to a lawsuit settled with our former insurance broker in 2019 related to the significant flood damage sustained at opry mills in may 2010 a 162 million gain on the sale of our interest in a multifamily residential property a 124 million increase in interest income an 112 million increase in simon brand venture and gift card revenues an increase of 104 million in land sales including gains as a result of land contributions for densification projects at two of our properties and the impact of consolidated franchise and hotel revenues partially offset by a 356 million noncash gain recorded in 2018 associated with our contribution of our interest in the aéropostale licensing venture for additional interests in abg a 267 million decrease in lease settlement income a 239 million decrease in income related to distributions from an international investment received in 2018 and a 95 million decrease related to business interruption insurance proceeds received in connection with our two puerto rico properties as a result of hurricane damages

depreciation and amortization expense increased 580 million of which the property transactions accounted for 110 million the comparable properties increased 470 million primarily as a result of an increase in tenant allowance writeoffs in 2019 and the acceleration of depreciation on a property upon initiation of a major redevelopment

home and regional office costs increased 534 million primarily due to the suspension of leasing cost capitalization in 2019 as a result of the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement

general and administrative expense decreased 117 million due to lower executive compensation

other expense increased 158 million primarily related to a 49 million unfavorable noncash marktomarket on certain of our nonreal estate equity instruments and the impact of consolidated franchise and hotel operational expenses

during 2019 we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of 1163 million as a result of the early redemption of senior unsecured notes

income from unconsolidated entities decreased 309 million as a result of the sale of german assets within our hbs joint venture in 2018 and the impact from the consolidation of a property that was previously unconsolidated in the third quarter of 2018 partially offset by favorable results of operations from our international joint venture investments

during 2019 we recorded net gains of 621 million primarily related to klépierre’s disposition of certain shopping centers offset by a 472 million impairment charge related to our investment in hbs during 2018 we recorded net gains of 125 million related to property insurance recoveries of previously depreciated assets and 2763 million primarily related to our disposition of two retail properties as well as the disposal of our interest in the german department stores owned through our investment in hbs as further discussed in note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

year ended december 31 2018 vs year ended december 31 2017 

lease income increased 493 million during 2018 of which the comparable rents increased 580 million or 12 primarily attributable to an increase in base minimum rents and variable consideration based on tenant sales offset partially by an 87 million decrease related to the property transactions 

total other income increased 736 million primarily due to a 356 million increase related to a noncash gain associated with our contribution of our interest in the aéropostale licensing venture for additional interests in abg a 219 million increase in income related to distributions from an international investment a 179 million increase related to business interruption insurance proceeds received in connection with two of our puerto rico properties as a result of hurricane damages a 132 million increase in simon brand venture and gift card revenues and a 65 million increase in net other revenues partially offset by a 215 million decrease related to the sale of marketable securities during 2017

real estate tax expense increased 177 million as a result of higher tax assessments in 2018

general and administrative expense decreased 54 million due to lower executive compensation

other expense decreased 374 million primarily related to a decrease in legal fees and expenses of 251 million and the write off of predevelopment costs and other investments in 2017 of 113 million

during 2017 we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of 1286 million as a result of an early redemption of a series of senior unsecured notes

income and other taxes increased 136 million as a result of higher tax expense due to higher net income from improved performance on our share of results in the retail operations venture of aéropostale as compared to 2017 and increased withholding and income taxes related to certain of our international investments

income from unconsolidated entities increased 750 million primarily due to the stronger operations of the retail operations venture of aéropostale and favorable results of operations from our international joint venture investments and our acquisition and development activity offset partially by our share of an early repayment charge at one of our joint venture properties

during 2018 we recorded net gains of 125 million related to property insurance recoveries of previously depreciated assets and 2763 million primarily related to our disposition of two retail properties as well as the disposal of our interest in the german department stores owned through our investment in hbs as further discussed in note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements during 2017 we recorded a 50 million gain related to klépierre’s sale of certain assets partially offset by the disposition of our interest in one unconsolidated retail property that resulted in a loss of 13 million

simon’s net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 853 million due to an increase in the net income of the operating partnership 

liquidity and capital resources 

because we own longlived incomeproducing assets our financing strategy relies primarily on longterm fixed rate debt floating rate debt comprised only 35 of our total consolidated debt at december 31 2019 we also enter into interest rate protection agreements from time to time to manage our interest rate risk we derive most of our liquidity from positive net cash flow from operations and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities that totaled 40 billion in the aggregate during 2019 the operating partnership has a 40 billion credit facility and a 35 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility or supplemental facility and together with the credit facility the credit facilities the credit facilities and the commercial paper program provide alternative sources of liquidity as our cash needs vary from time to time borrowing capacity under these sources may be increased as discussed further below

our balance of cash and cash equivalents increased 1550 million during 2019 to 6694 million as of december 31 2019 as further discussed in “cash flows” below

on december 31 2019 we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of approximately 60 billion under the credit facilities net of outstanding borrowings of 1250 million amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program of 13 billion and letters of credit of 114 million for the year ended december 31 2019 the maximum aggregate outstanding balance under the credit facilities was 1307 million and the weighted average outstanding balance was 1251 million the weighted average interest rate was 304 for the year ended december 31 2019 

simon has historically had access to public equity markets and the operating partnership has historically had access to private and public short and longterm unsecured debt markets and access to secured debt and private equity from institutional investors at the property level

our business model and simon’s status as a reit require us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition development and redevelopment activity and to refinance maturing debt simon may also from time to time access the equity capital markets to accomplish our business objectives we believe we have sufficient cash on hand and availability under the credit facilities and the commercial paper program to address our debt maturities and capital needs through 2020

cash flows 

our net cash flow from operating activities and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities totaled 40 billion during 2019 in addition we had net proceeds from our debt financing and repayment activities of 7846 million including 1000 million of cash paid to extinguish debt these activities are further discussed below under “financing and debt” during 2019 we also

 

in general we anticipate that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating expenses monthly debt service recurring capital expenditures and dividends to stockholders andor distributions to partners necessary to maintain simon’s reit qualification on a longterm basis in addition we expect to be able to generate or obtain capital for nonrecurring capital expenditures such as acquisitions major building redevelopments and expansions as well as for scheduled principal maturities on outstanding indebtedness from

 

we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2020 and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash these cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our tenants a significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds from the credit facilities and commercial paper program curtail planned capital expenditures or seek other additional sources of financing as discussed above

at december 31 2019 our unsecured debt consisted of 159 billion of senior unsecured notes of the operating partnership 1250 million outstanding under the operating partnership’s 40 billion unsecured revolving credit facility or credit facility and 13 billion outstanding under the operating partnership’s global unsecured commercial paper program or commercial paper program

mortgage debt 

total mortgage indebtedness was 69 billion and 68 billion at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively

​ 

covenants 

our unsecured debt agreements contain financial covenants and other nonfinancial covenants if we were to fail to comply with these covenants after the expiration of the applicable cure periods the debt maturity could be accelerated or other remedies could be sought by the lender including adjustments to the applicable interest rate as of december 31 2019 we were in compliance with all covenants of our unsecured debt

at december 31 2019 our consolidated subsidiaries were the borrowers under 46 nonrecourse mortgage notes secured by mortgages on 50 properties and other assets including two separate pools of crossdefaulted and crosscollateralized mortgages encumbering a total of five properties under these crossdefault provisions a default under any mortgage included in the crossdefaulted pool may constitute a default under all mortgages within that pool and may lead to acceleration of the indebtedness due on each property within the pool certain of our secured debt instruments contain financial and other nonfinancial covenants which are specific to the properties that serve as collateral for that debt if the applicable borrower under these nonrecourse mortgage notes were to fail to comply with these covenants the lender could accelerate the debt and enforce its rights against their collateral at december 31 2019 the applicable borrowers under these nonrecourse mortgage notes were in compliance with all covenants where noncompliance could individually or in the aggregate giving effect to applicable crossdefault provisions have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity or results of operations

summary of financing 

our consolidated debt adjusted to reflect outstanding derivative instruments and the effective weighted average interest rates as of december 31 2019 and 2018 consisted of the following dollars in thousands

 

 

contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

in regards to longterm debt arrangements the following table summarizes the material aspects of these future obligations on our consolidated indebtedness as of december 31 2019 and subsequent years thereafter dollars in thousands assuming the obligations remain outstanding through initial maturities

 

 

our offbalance sheet arrangements consist primarily of our investments in joint ventures which are common in the real estate industry and are described in note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements our joint ventures typically fund their cash needs through secured debt financings obtained by and in the name of the joint venture entity the joint venture debt is secured by a first mortgage is without recourse to the joint venture partners and does not represent a liability of the partners except to the extent the partners or their affiliates expressly guarantee the joint venture debt as of december 31 2019 the operating partnership guaranteed joint venturerelated mortgage indebtedness of 2148 million of which we have a right of recovery from our venture partners of 108 million as of december 31 2019 mortgages guaranteed by the operating partnership are secured by the property of the joint venture which could be sold in order to satisfy the outstanding obligation and which has an estimated fair value in excess of the guaranteed amount we may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests advances or partner loans although such fundings are not required contractually or otherwise

hurricane impacts 

as discussed further in note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements during the third quarter of 2017 two of our whollyowned properties located in puerto rico sustained significant property damage and business interruption as a result of hurricane maria 

since the date of the loss we have received 739 million of insurance proceeds from thirdparty carriers related to the two properties located in puerto rico of which 455 million was used for property restoration and remediation and to reduce the insurance recovery receivable during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 we recorded 105 million and 179 million respectively as business interruption income which was recorded in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 

acquisitions and dispositions 

buysell marketing rights and other exit mechanisms are common in real estate partnership agreements most of our partners are institutional investors who have a history of direct investment in retail real estate we and our partners in our joint venture properties may initiate these provisions subject to any applicable lock up or similar restrictions if we determine it is in our best interests for us to purchase the joint venture interest and we believe we have adequate liquidity to execute the purchase without hindering our cash flows then we may initiate these provisions or elect to buy our partner’s interest if we decide to sell any of our joint venture interests we expect to use the net proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness or to reinvest in development redevelopment or expansion opportunities

acquisitions on september 19 2019 we acquired the remaining 50 interest in a hotel adjacent to one of our properties from our joint venture partner for cash consideration of 128 million as of closing the property was subject to a 215 million 402 variable rate mortgage 

on september 25 2018 we acquired the remaining 50 interest in the outlets at orange from our joint venture partner the operating partnership issued 475183 units or approximately 841 million as consideration for the acquisition the property is subject to a 2150 million 422 fixed rate mortgage loan 

dispositions we may continue to pursue the disposition of properties that no longer meet our strategic criteria or that are not a primary retail venue within their trade area

during 2019 we disposed of our interests in one multifamily residential investment our share of the gross proceeds on this transaction was 179 million our share of the gain of 162 million is included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income we also recorded net gains of 621 million primarily related to klépierre’s disposition of its interests in certain shopping centers of which our share was 586 million as discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements

during 2018 we recorded net gains of 2888 million primarily related to disposition activity which included the foreclosure of two consolidated retail properties in satisfaction of their 2000 million and 800 million nonrecourse mortgage loans and as discussed in note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements our interest in the german department store properties owned through our investment in hbs was sold during the fourth quarter of 2018 also as discussed further in note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements klépierre disposed of its interests in certain shopping centers resulting in a gain of which our share was 202 million

during 2017 we disposed of our interest in one unconsolidated retail property the loss recognized on this transaction was approximately 13 million as discussed in note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements klépierre’s disposition of its interest in certain shopping centers resulting in a gain of which our share was 50 million 

joint venture formation activity 

on october 16 2019 we contributed approximately 2768 million consisting of cash and the shop premium outlets or spo assets for a 45 noncontrolling interest in rue gilt groupe or rgg to create a new multiplatform venture dedicated to digital value shopping as further discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

subsequent event 

on february 10 2020 we and taubman centers inc a publicly held michigan corporation “tco” issued a joint press release announcing the execution of an agreement and plan of merger the “merger agreement” dated as of february 9 2020 pursuant to which among other things and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions the operating partnership will acquire 100 of the equity interests of tco and following the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement will hold 80 of the equity interests of the taubman realty group limited partnership “trg” with the taubman family as defined in the merger agreement retaining a 20 interest in trg consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions including the approval and adoption of the merger agreement by i shareholders holding twothirds of tco’s outstanding voting stock and ii shareholders excluding the taubman family holding a majority of tco’s outstanding voting stock 

trg is engaged in the ownership management andor leasing of 26 superregional shopping centers in the us and asia the trg board will be comprised of 3 simon designees and 3 taubman designees trg will continue to be managed by its existing executive team we through the operating partnership will acquire all of taubman common stock for 5250 per share in cash and expect to fund the total required cash consideration of approximately 36 billion with existing liquidity 

development activity 

we routinely incur costs related to construction for significant redevelopment and expansion projects at our properties redevelopment and expansion projects including the addition of anchors big box tenants and restaurants are underway at several properties in the united states canada europe and asia

our share of the costs of all new development redevelopment and expansion projects currently under construction is approximately 18 billion we expect to fund these capital projects with cash flows from operations our estimated stabilized return on invested capital typically ranges between 710 for all our new development redevelopment and expansion projects

summary of capital expenditures the following table summarizes total capital expenditures on consolidated properties on a cash basis in millions

 ​ 

new domestic developments redevelopments and expansions 

in the third quarter construction started on a 338000 square foot upscale outlet located in jenks tulsa oklahoma projected to open in spring of 2021 we own a 100 interest in this project

on september 25 2018 we opened denver premium outlets a 330000 square foot center in thornton denver colorado we own a 100 interest in this project the cost of this project was 1286 million

​ 

international development activity 

we typically reinvest net cash flow from our international joint ventures to fund future international development activity we believe this strategy mitigates some of the risk of our initial investment and our exposure to changes in foreign currencies we have also funded most of our foreign investments with local currencydenominated borrowings that act as a natural hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates our consolidated net income exposure to changes in the volatility of the euro yen peso won and other foreign currencies is not material we expect our share of international development costs for 2020 will be approximately 211 million primarily funded through reinvested joint venture cash flow and construction loans

the following table describes recently completed and new development and expansion projects as well as our share of the estimated total cost as of december 31 2019 in millions

 

 

dividends distributions and stock repurchase program

certain statements made in this section or elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k may be deemed forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 although we believe the expectations reflected in any forwardlooking statements are based on reasonable assumptions we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained and it is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forwardlooking statements due to a variety of risks uncertainties and other factors such factors include but are not limited to changes in economic and market conditions that may adversely affect the general retail environment the potential loss of anchor stores or major tenants the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise decreases in market rental rates the intensely competitive market environment in the retail industry the inability to lease newly developed properties and renew leases and relet space at existing properties on favorable terms risks related to international activities including without limitation the impact if any of the united kingdom’s exit from the european union changes to applicable laws or regulations or the interpretation thereof risks associated with the acquisition development redevelopment expansion leasing and management of properties general risks related to real estate investments including the illiquidity of real estate investments the impact of our substantial indebtedness on our future operations any disruption in the financial markets that may adversely affect our ability to access capital for growth and satisfy our ongoing debt service requirements any change in our credit rating changes in market rates of interest and foreign exchange rates for foreign currencies changes in the value of our investments in foreign entities our ability to hedge interest rate and currency risk our continued ability to maintain our status as a reit changes in tax laws or regulations that result in adverse tax consequences risks relating to our joint venture properties environmental liabilities changes in insurance costs the availability of comprehensive insurance coverage security breaches that could compromise our information technology or infrastructure natural disasters the potential for terrorist activities the loss of key management personnel and the transition of libor to an alternative reference rate we discussed these and other risks and uncertainties under the heading risk factors in part i item1a of this annual report on form 10k we may update that discussion in subsequent other periodic reports but except as required by law we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise these forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise

nongaap financial measures 

industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties in part based on performance measures such as ffo diluted ffo per share noi portfolio noi and comparable property noi we believe that these nongaap measures are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of reits and provide a relevant basis for comparison among reits we also use these measures internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio

we determine ffo based upon the definition set forth by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” funds from operations white paper – 2018 restatement our main business includes acquiring owning operating developing and redeveloping real estate in conjunction with the rental of real estate gains and losses of assets incidental to our main business are included in ffo we determine ffo to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with gaap

 

you should understand that our computations of these nongaap measures might not be comparable to similar measures reported by other reits and that these nongaap measures



 

the following schedule reconciles total ffo to consolidated net income and for simon diluted net income per share to diluted ffo per share

 

 

the following schedule reconciles consolidated net income to noi and sets forth the computations of portfolio noi and comparable property noi

 



 

item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our longterm debt obligations we manage exposure to interest rate market risk through our risk management strategy by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of variable rate debt we are also exposed to foreign currency risk on financings of certain foreign operations our intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging these exposures we do not enter into either interest rate protection or foreign currency rate protection agreements for speculative purposes

we may enter into treasury lock agreements as part of anticipated issuances of senior notes upon completion of the debt issuance the cost of these instruments is recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt agreement

our future earnings cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest primarily libor based upon consolidated indebtedness and interest rates at december 31 2019 a 50 basis point increase in the market rates of interest would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 44 million and would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately 7134 million

other policies 

the following is a discussion of our investment policies financing policies conflict of interest policies and policies with respect to certain other activities one or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote 

investment policies 

while we emphasize equity real estate investments we may also provide secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers consistent with simon’s qualification as a reit however any of these investments would be subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for reit qualification these reit limitations mean that simon cannot make an investment that would cause its real estate assets to be less than 75 of its total assets simon must also derive at least 75 of its gross income directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including “rents from real property” dividends from other reits and in certain circumstances interest from certain types of temporary investments in addition simon must also derive at least 95 of its gross income from such real property investments and from dividends interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing 

subject to simon’s reit limitations we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate such an investment would normally be in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties we may in the future acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies 

 

financing policies 

because simon’s reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of its reit taxable income we regularly access the debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions develop and redevelop properties and refinance maturing debt we must comply with the covenants contained in our financing agreements that limit our ratio of debt to total assets or market value as defined for example the operating partnership’s lines of credit and the indentures for the operating partnership’s debt securities contain covenants that restrict the total amount of debt of the operating partnership to 65 or 60 in relation to certain debt of total assets as defined under the related agreements and secured debt to 50 of total assets in addition these agreements contain other covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios furthermore the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for the debt securities of the operating partnership we strive to maintain investment grade ratings at all times for various business reasons including their effect on our ability to access attractive capital but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so in the future 

if simon’s board of directors determines to seek additional capital we may raise such capital by offering equity or incurring debt creating joint ventures with existing ownership interests in properties entering into joint venture arrangements for new development projects retaining cash flows or a combination of these methods if simon’s board of directors determines to raise equity capital it may without stockholder approval issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock simon’s board of directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital or may issue units in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate we may also raise additional capital by issuing common units of partnership interest in the operating partnership or units such securities also may include additional classes of simon’s preferred stock or preferred units of partnership interest in the operating partnership or preferred units which may be convertible into common stock or units as the case may be existing stockholders and unitholders have no preemptive right to purchase shares or units in any subsequent issuances of securities by us any issuance of equity could dilute a stockholder’s investment in simon or a limited partner’s investment in the operating partnership 

we expect most future borrowings will be made through the operating partnership or its subsidiaries we might however incur borrowings through other entities that would be reloaned to the operating partnership borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings publicly and privately placed debt instruments or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties any such indebtedness may be secured or unsecured any such indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to the borrower or be cross‑collateralized with other debt or may be fully or partially guaranteed by the operating partnership we issue unsecured debt securities through the operating partnership but we may issue other debt securities which may be convertible into common or preferred stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase common or preferred stock we also may sell or securitize our lease receivables although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends we currently have no expectation that we will regularly do so 

the operating partnership has a 40 billion unsecured revolving credit facility or credit facility the credit facility’s initial borrowing capacity of 40 billion may be increased to 50 billion during its term the initial maturity date of the credit facility is june 30 2021 and can be extended for an additional year to june 30 2022 at our sole option subject to our continued compliance with the terms thereof the base interest rate on the credit facility is libor plus 775 basis points with an additional facility fee of 10 basis points the operating partnership also has a 35 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility or supplemental facility and together with the credit facility the credit facilities on february 15 2018 the operating partnership amended and extended the supplemental facility the supplemental facility’s initial borrowing capacity of 35 billion may be increased to 45 billion during its term the initial maturity date of the supplemental facility was extended to june 30 2022 and can be extended for an additional year to june 30 2023 at our sole option subject to our continued compliance with the terms thereof the base interest rate on the supplemental facility was reduced to libor plus 775 basis points from libor plus 80 basis points with an additional facility fee of 10 basis points the credit facilities provide for borrowings denominated in us dollars euro yen sterling canadian dollars and australian dollars 

the operating partnership also has available a global unsecured commercial paper note program or commercial paper program on november 14 2018 the operating partnership increased the maximum aggregate program size of its commercial paper program from 10 billion to 20 billion or the non‑us dollar equivalent thereof the operating partnership may issue unsecured commercial paper notes denominated in us dollars euro and other currencies notes issued in non‑us currencies may be issued by one or more subsidiaries of the operating partnership and are guaranteed by the operating partnership notes are sold under customary terms in the us and euro commercial paper note markets and rank either by themselves or as a result of the guarantee described above pari passu with the operating partnership’s other unsecured senior indebtedness the commercial paper program is supported by the credit facilities and if 

 

necessary or appropriate we may make one or more draws under either credit facility to pay amounts outstanding from time to time on the commercial paper program 

we may also finance our business through the following 















the operating partnership may also issue units to contributors of properties or other partnership interests which may permit the contributor to defer tax gain recognition under the internal revenue code 

we do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property mortgage financing instruments however typically limit additional indebtedness on such properties additionally the credit facilities our unsecured note indentures and other contracts may limit our ability to borrow and contain limits on mortgage indebtedness we may incur as well as certain financial covenants we must maintain 

typically we invest in or form special purpose entities to assist us in obtaining secured permanent financing at attractive terms permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage loan on a single property or on a group of properties and generally requires us to provide a mortgage lien on the property or properties in favor of an institutional third party as a joint venture with a third party or as a securitized financing for securitized financings we create special purpose entities to own the properties these special purpose entities which are common in the real estate industry are structured so that they would not be consolidated in a bankruptcy proceeding involving a parent company we decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives for accounting purposes we include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness 

conflict of interest policies 

we maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest simon has adopted governance principles governing the function conduct selection orientation and duties of its subsidiaries and simon’s board of directors and the company as well as written charters for each of the standing committees of simon’s board of directors in addition simon’s board of directors has a code of business conduct and ethics which applies to all of its officers directors and employees and those of its subsidiaries at least a majority of the members of simon’s board of directors must qualify and do qualify as independent under the listing standards of the new york stock exchange or nyse and cannot be affiliated with the simon family who are significant stockholders in simon andor unitholders in the operating partnership in addition the audit and compensation committees of simon’s board of directors are comprised entirely of independent members who meet the additional independence and financial expert requirements of the nyse any transaction between us and the simon family including property acquisitions service and property management agreements and retail space leases must be approved by a majority of simon’s nonaffiliated directors 

the sale by the operating partnership of any property that it owns may have an adverse tax impact on the simon family or other limited partners of the operating partnership in order to avoid any conflict of interest the simon charter requires that at least threefourths of simon’s independent directors must authorize and require the operating partnership to sell any property it owns any such sale is subject to applicable agreements with third parties noncompetition agreements executed by david simon simon’s chairman chief executive officer and president and herbert simon simon’s chairman emeritus as well as david simons employment agreement contain covenants limiting their ability to participate in certain shopping center activities 

 

policies with respect to certain other activities 

we intend to make investments which are consistent with simon’s qualification as a reit unless simon’s board of directors determines that it is no longer in simon’s best interests to so qualify as a reit simon’s board of directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the reit requirements simon has authority to issue shares of its capital stock or other securities in exchange for property we also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire simon’s shares the operating partnership’s units or any other securities on february 13 2017 simon’s board of directors authorized a twoyear extension of the previously authorized 20 billion common stock repurchase plan or the repurchase program through march 31 2019 and on february 11 2019 simons board of directors authorized a new common stock repurchase plan under the new program the company may purchase up to 20 billion of its common stock during the twoyear period ending february 11 2021 under the repurchase program simon may repurchase the shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at december 31 2018 we had remaining authority to repurchase 6406 million of common stock simon may also issue shares of its common stock or pay cash at its option to holders of units in future periods upon exercise of such holders’ rights under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership our policy prohibits us from making any loans to the directors or executive officers of simon for any purpose we may make loans to the joint ventures in which we participate additionally we may make or buy interests in loans secured by real estate properties owned by others or make investments in companies that own real estate assets 

competition 

the retail real estate industry is dynamic and competitive we compete with numerous merchandise distribution channels including malls outlet centers communitylifestyle centers and other shopping centers in the united states and abroad we also compete with internet retailing sites and catalogs which provide retailers with distribution options beyond existing brick and mortar retail properties the existence of competitive alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we can obtain this results in competition for both the tenants to occupy the properties that we develop and manage as well as for the acquisition of prime sites including land for development and operating properties we believe that there are numerous factors that make our properties highly desirable to retailers including

 item 1a risk factors 

the following factors among others could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward‑looking statements made in this annual report on form 10‑k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations funds from operations or ffo and prospects which we refer to herein as a material adverse effect on us or as materially and adversely affecting us and you should carefully consider them additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which are currently not believed to be material may also affect our actual results we may update these factors in our future periodic reports 

risks relating to retail operations 

conditions that adversely affect the general retail environment could materially and adversely affect us 

our concentration in the retail real estate market – our primary source of revenue is retail tenants – means that we could be materially and adversely affected by conditions that materially and adversely affect the retail environment generally including without limitation 



















some of our properties depend on anchor stores or other large nationally recognized tenants to attract shoppers and we could be materially and adversely affected by the loss of one or more of these anchors or tenants 

our properties are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally recognized tenants certain of our anchors and other tenants have ceased their operations downsized their brickandmortar presence or failed to comply with their contractual obligations to us and others 

for example among department stores and other national retailers — often referred to as “big box” stores — corporate merger activity typically results in the closure of duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations further sustained adverse pressure on the results of our department stores and other national retailers may have a similarly sustained adverse impact upon our own results certain department stores and other national retailers have experienced and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future given current macroeconomic uncertainty and lessthandesirable levels of consumer confidence considerable decreases in customer traffic in their retail stores increased competition from alternative retail options such as those accessible via the internet and other forms of pressure on their business models as pressure on these department stores and other national retailers increases their ability to maintain their stores meet their obligations both to us and to their external lenders and suppliers withstand takeover attempts or avoid bankruptcy andor liquidation may be impaired and result in closures of their stores or their seeking of a lease 

 

modification with us any lease modification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and could decrease current or future effective rents or expense recovery charges other tenants may be entitled to modify the economic or other terms of or terminate their existing leases with us in the event of such closures 

if a department store or large nationally recognized tenant were to close its stores at our properties we may experience difficulty and delay and incur significant expense in retenanting the space as well as in leasing spaces in areas adjacent to the vacant store at attractive rates or at all additionally department store or tenant closures may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sales at our properties if the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to the closing of anchor stores or other national retailers adverse economic conditions or other reasons tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges in the event of any default by a tenant we may not be able to fully recover andor may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our leases with such parties 

we face potential adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies 

bankruptcy filings by retailers can occur regularly in the course of our operations if a tenant files for bankruptcy the tenant may have the right to reject and terminate one or more of its leases with us and we cannot be sure that it will affirm one or more of its leases and continue to make rental payments to us in a timely manner a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants would generally prohibit us from evicting this tenant and bar all efforts by us to collect prebankruptcy debts from that tenant or from their property unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court in addition we cannot evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy if a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy all prebankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full if a lease is rejected the unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims and there are restrictions under bankruptcy laws that limit the amount of the claim we can make if a lease is rejected as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold in addition we may make lease modifications either pre or postbankruptcy for certain tenants undergoing significant financial distress in order for them to continue as a going concern furthermore we may be required to incur significant expense in retenanting the space formerly leased to the bankrupt tenant we continually seek to release vacant spaces resulting from tenant terminations the bankruptcy of a tenant particularly an anchor tenant or a national tenant with multiple locations may require a substantial redevelopment of their space the success of which cannot be assured and may make the retenanting of their space difficult and costly and it also may be more difficult to lease the remainder of the space at the affected property future tenant bankruptcies may strain our resources and impact our ability to successfully execute our releasing strategy and could materially and adversely affect us 

we face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably 

our properties compete with other retail properties and other forms of retailing such as ecommerce websites competition may come from malls outlet centers communitylifestyle centers and other shopping centers both existing as well as future development and redevelopmentexpansion projects as well as ecommerce the presence of competitive alternatives affects our ability to lease space and puts downward pressure on the rents we can charge our tenants new construction redevelopments and expansions at competing sites could also negatively affect our properties 

we also compete with other major real estate investors and developers for attractive investment opportunities and prime development sites competition for the acquisition of existing properties and development sites may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect our ability to make attractive investments on favorable terms or at all in addition we compete with other retail property companies for tenants and qualified management 

excess space at our properties could materially and adversely affect us 

certain of our properties have had excess space available for prospective tenants and those properties may continue to experience and other properties may commence experiencing such oversupply in the future among other causes 1 there has been an increased number of bankruptcies of anchor stores and other national retailers as well as store closures and 2 there has been lower demand from retail tenants for space due to certain retailers increasing their use of ecommerce websites to distribute their merchandise as a result of the increased bargaining power of creditworthy retail tenants there is downward pressure on our rental rates and occupancy levels and this increased bargaining power may also result in us having to increase our spend on tenant improvements and potentially make other lease modifications any of which in the aggregate could materially and adversely affect us 

 

we may not be able to lease newly developed properties and renew leases and relet space at existing properties 

we may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants that generates optimal customer traffic also when leases for our existing properties expire the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms if we elect to pursue a “mixed use” redevelopment we expose ourselves to risks associated with each nonretail use eg office residential hotel and entertainment to the extent that our leasing goals are not achieved we could be materially and adversely affected 

risks relating to real estate investments and operations 

our international activities may subject us to different or greater risk from those associated with our domestic operations 

as of december 31 2018 we held interests in consolidated and joint venture properties that operate in austria canada france italy germany japan malaysia mexico the netherlands south korea and the united kingdom we also have an equity stake in klépierre a publicly traded european real estate company which operates in 16 countries in europe accordingly our operating results and the value of our international operations may be impacted by any unhedged movements in the foreign currencies in which those operations transact and in which our net investment in the international operation is held we may pursue additional investment development and redevelopmentexpansion opportunities outside the united states international investment ownership development and redevelopmentexpansion activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our domestic properties and operations these risks include but are not limited to 





















our international activities represented approximately 51 of consolidated net income and 100 of our net operating income or noi for the year ended december 31 2018 to the extent that we expand our international activities the above risks could increase in significance which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us 

we face risks associated with the acquisition development redevelopment and expansion of properties 

we regularly acquire and develop new properties and redevelop and expand existing properties and these activities are subject to various risks we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition development or redevelopmentexpansion opportunities in addition newly acquired developed or redevelopedexpanded properties may not perform as well as expected impacting our anticipated return on investment we are subject to other risks in connection with any acquisition development and redevelopmentexpansion activities including the following 







 







if a development or redevelopmentexpansion project is unsuccessful either because it is not meeting our expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project planning we could lose our investment in the project further if we guarantee the property’s financing our loss could exceed our investment in the project 

in the event that these risks were realized at the same time at multiple properties we could be materially and adversely affected 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid 

our properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets these investments are relatively illiquid as a result our ability to sell one or more of our properties or investments in real estate in response to any changes in economic industry or other conditions may be limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability and terms of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand for space that are beyond our control if we want to sell a property we cannot assure you that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or at all or that the sales price of a property will be attractive at the relevant time or exceed the carrying value of our investment moreover if a property is mortgaged we may not be able to obtain a release of the lien on that property without the payment of the associated debt andor a substantial prepayment penalty which could restrict our ability to dispose of the property even though the sale might otherwise be desirable 

risks relating to debt and the financial markets 

we have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations 

as of december 31 2018 our consolidated mortgages and unsecured indebtedness excluding related premium discount and debt issuance costs totaled 234 billion as a result of this indebtedness we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows for debt service including selected repayment at scheduled maturities which limits our ability to use those cash flows to fund the growth of our business we are also subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flows from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service or that we will be able to refinance such indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the applicable property such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants cause a reduction in the income from the property our indebtedness could also have other adverse consequences on us including reducing our access to capital or increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic industry and market conditions in addition if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value if any of the foregoing occurs we could be materially and adversely affected 

the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that might affect our ability to operate freely 

we have a variety of unsecured debt including the credit facilities senior unsecured notes and commercial paper and secured property level debt certain of the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain covenants including among other things limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured indebtedness sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and certain acquisitions in addition certain of the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain financial covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios including certain coverage ratios these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous to us in addition our ability to comply with these provisions might be affected by events beyond our control failure to comply with any of our financing covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate the related indebtedness as well as other of our indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements 

we depend on external financings principally debt financings to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt our access to financing depends on the willingness of lending institutions and other debt investors to grant credit to us and conditions in the capital markets in general an economic recession may cause extreme volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets we rely upon the credit facilities as sources of funding for numerous transactions our access to these funds is dependent upon the ability of each of the participants to the credit facilities to meet their funding commitments to us when markets are volatile access to capital and credit markets could be disrupted over an extended period of time and one or more financial institutions may not have the available capital to meet their previous commitments to us the failure of one or more participants to the credit facilities to meet their funding commitments to us could have a material adverse effect on us including as a result of making it difficult to obtain the financing we may need for future growth andor meeting our debt service requirements we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for the future growth of our business or to meet our debt service requirements or that a sufficient amount of financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 

adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

the operating partnership’s outstanding senior unsecured notes credit facilities the commercial paper program and simon’s preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios financial condition and prospects and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to us and our industry and the economic outlook in general our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund the growth of our business an adverse change in our credit rating including actual changes and changes in outlook or even the initiation of a review of our credit rating that could result in an adverse change could have a material adverse effect on us 

an increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt on attractive terms or at all our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2018 we had approximately 844 million of outstanding consolidated indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates and we may incur more variable rate indebtedness in the future if interest rates increase then so would the interest costs on our unhedged variable rate debt which could adversely affect our cash flows and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders further rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or significantly increase our future interest expense 

we selectively manage our exposure to interest rate risk by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap all or a portion of our variable rate debt in addition we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and other terms are appropriate our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful 

our use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations or that we could be required to fund our contractual payment obligations under such arrangements in relatively large amounts or on short notice developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs 

risks relating to income taxes 

simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership have elected to be taxed as reits in the united states and certain international operations also are structured to be taxed in a manner similar to the reit structure the failure to maintain simon’s or these subsidiaries’ qualifications as reits or changes in local tax laws or regulations in certain of our international operations could result in adverse tax consequences 

we are subject to certain incomebased taxes both domestically and internationally and other taxes including state and local taxes franchise taxes and withholding taxes on dividends from certain of our international investments we 

 

currently follow local tax laws and regulations in various domestic and international jurisdictions should these laws or regulations change the amount of taxes we pay may increase accordingly 

in the united states simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership have elected to be taxed as reits under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code we believe simon and these subsidiaries have been organized and operated in a manner which allows them to qualify for taxation as reits under the internal revenue code we intend to continue to operate in this manner however qualification and taxation as reits depend upon the ability of simon and these subsidiaries to satisfy several requirements some of which are outside our control including tests related to our annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various reit qualification tests required by the internal revenue code are highly technical and complex accordingly there can be no assurance that simon or any of these subsidiaries has operated in accordance with these requirements or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

if simon or any of these subsidiaries fail to comply with those provisions simon or any such subsidiary may be subject to monetary penalties or ultimately to possible disqualification as reits if such events occur and if available relief provisions do not apply 







any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for among other things our operations and distributions to stockholders in addition if simon fails to qualify as a reit it will not be required to make distributions to our stockholders moreover a failure by any subsidiary of the operating partnership that has elected to be taxed as a reit to qualify as a reit would also cause simon to fail to qualify as a reit and the same adverse consequences would apply to it and its stockholders failure by simon or any of these subsidiaries to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital which could materially and adversely affect us 

the tax imposed on reits engaging in “prohibited transactions” may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for us federal income tax purposes 

a reit’s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100 penalty tax in general prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the internal revenue service or the irs would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors 

reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan 

in order for simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership to qualify to be taxed as reits and assuming that certain other requirements are also satisfied simon and each such subsidiary generally must distribute at least 90 of their respective reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains to their respective equity holders each year to this point simon and each such subsidiary have historically distributed at least 100 of taxable income and thereby avoided income tax altogether to the extent that simon or any such subsidiary satisfies this distribution requirement and qualifies for taxation as a reit but distributes less than 100 of its reit taxable income simon or any such subsidiary will be subject to us federal corporate income tax on its undistributed net taxable income and could be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that is distributed to equity holders in a calendar year is less than “the required minimum distribution amount” specified under us federal income tax laws we intend to make distributions to the equity holders of simon and the aforementioned subsidiaries of the operating partnership to comply with the reit requirements of the internal revenue code 

from time to time simon and the aforementioned subsidiaries of the operating partnership might generate taxable income greater than their respective cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt 

 

or amortization payments if simon and these subsidiaries do not have other funds available in these situations simon and these subsidiaries could be required to access capital on unfavorable terms the receipt of which cannot be assured sell assets at disadvantageous prices distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions capital expenditures or repayment of debt or make taxable distributions of capital stock or debt securities to make distributions sufficient to enable them to pay out enough of their respective reit taxable income to satisfy the reit distribution requirement and avoid corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase costs or reduce our equity further amounts distributed will not be available to fund the growth of our business thus compliance with the reit requirements may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan 

complying with reit requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive acquisition opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments 

to qualify to be taxed as reits for us federal income tax purposes simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of their respective assets consist of cash cash items government securities and “real estate assets” as defined in the internal revenue code including certain mortgage loans and securities the remainder of their respective investments other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable reit subsidiary or trs generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer 

additionally in general no more than 5 of the value of simon’s and these subsidiaries’ total assets other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a trs can consist of the securities of any one issuer and no more than 20 of the value of their respective total assets can be represented by securities of one or more trss if simon or any of these subsidiaries fails to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter simon or any such subsidiary must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing its reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences as a result we might be required to liquidate or forego otherwise attractive investments these actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to equity holders 

in addition to the asset tests set forth above to qualify to be taxed as reits simon and these subsidiaries must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of their respective income the amounts they distribute to equity holders and the ownership of their respective shares we might be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the sourceofincome or assetdiversification requirements for qualifying as reits thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments 

partnership tax audit rules could have a material adverse effect on us 

the bipartisan budget act of 2015 changes the rules applicable to us federal income tax audits of partnerships under the rules among other changes and subject to certain exceptions any audit adjustment to items of income gain loss deduction or credit of a partnership and any partner’s distributive share thereof is determined and taxes interest or penalties attributable thereto could be assessed and collected at the partnership level absent available elections it is possible that a partnership in which we directly or indirectly invest could be required to pay additional taxes interest and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment and we as a direct or indirect partner of these partnerships could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes interest and penalties even though simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership as reits may not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporatelevel taxes had they owned the assets of the partnership directly the partnership tax audit rules apply to the operating partnership and its subsidiaries that are classified as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes the changes created by these rules are sweeping and accordingly there can be no assurance that these rules will not have a material adverse effect on us 

legislative administrative regulatory or other actions affecting reits including positions taken by the irs could have a material adverse effect on us and our investors 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us department of the treasury or the treasury changes to the tax laws or interpretations thereof by the irs and the treasury with or without retroactive application could materially and adversely affect us and our investors new legislation including the recently enacted tax cuts and jobs act or the tcja and any technical corrections legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect the ability of simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership to qualify to be taxed as reits andor the us federal income tax consequences to us and our investors of such qualification 

 

the tcja has significantly changed the us federal income taxation of us businesses and their owners including reits and their stockholders a change made by the tcja that could affect us and our stockholders is that it generally limits the deduction for net business interest expense in excess of 30 of a business’s adjusted taxable income except for taxpayers that engage in certain real estate businesses and elect out of this rule provided that such electing taxpayers must use an alternative depreciation system for certain property 

risks relating to joint ventures 

we have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance them 

as of december 31 2018 we owned interests in 99 incomeproducing properties with other parties of those 18 properties are included in our consolidated financial statements we account for the other 81 properties or the joint venture properties as well as our investments in klépierre a publicly traded parisbased real estate company aéropostale authentic brands group llc or abg and hbs global properties or hbs using the equity method of accounting we serve as general partner or property manager for 57 of these 81 joint venture properties however certain major decisions such as approving the operating budget and selling refinancing and redeveloping the properties require the consent of the other owners of the joint venture properties for which we do not serve as general partner or property manager 20 are in our international joint ventures these international properties are managed locally by joint ventures in which we share control of the properties with our partner the other owners have participating rights that we consider substantive for purposes of determining control over the joint venture properties’ assets the remaining joint venture properties klépierre and our joint ventures with aéropostale abg and hbs are managed by third parties 

these investments and other future similar investments could involve risks that would not be present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or other owners might become bankrupt suffer a deterioration in their creditworthiness or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or other owners could have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our own business interests or goals and could be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives 

these investments and other future similar investments also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions such as a sale or financing because neither we nor our partner or other owner has full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or other owners might result in litigation or arbitration that could increase our expenses and prevent simon’s officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or other owners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we risk the possibility of being liable for the actions of our partners or other owners 

the operating partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties 

joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property which is nonrecourse to us nevertheless the joint venture’s failure to satisfy its debt obligations could result in the loss of our investment therein as of december 31 2018 the operating partnership guaranteed joint venture related mortgage indebtedness of 2161 million of which we have a right of recovery from our joint venture partners of 108 million a default by a joint venture under its debt obligations would expose us to liability under a guaranty we may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests advances or partner loans although such fundings are not typically required contractually or otherwise 

risks relating to environmental matters 

as owners of real estate we can face liabilities for environmental contamination 

us federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require us as a current or previous owner or operator of real property to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at a property or at impacted neighboring properties these laws often impose liability regardless of whether the property owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances these laws and regulations may require the abatement or removal of asbestos containing materials in the event of damage demolition or renovation reconstruction or expansion of a property and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air those laws and regulations also govern the installation maintenance and removal of underground storage 

 

tanks used to store waste oils or other petroleum products many of our properties contain or at one time contained asbestos containing materials or underground storage tanks primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment we may be subject to regulatory action and may also be held liable to third parties for personal injury or property damage incurred by the parties in connection with any such laws and regulations or hazardous or toxic substances the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances and related liabilities may be substantial and could materially and adversely affect us the presence of hazardous or toxic substances or the failure to remediate the related contamination may also adversely affect our ability to sell lease or redevelop a property or to borrow money using a property as collateral 

our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful 

although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with us federal state and local environmental laws and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances this belief is based on limited testing nearly all of our properties have been subjected to phase i or similar environmental audits these environmental audits have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us however we cannot assure you that 









we face risks associated with climate change 

to the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns our properties in certain markets could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels over time these conditions could result in volatile or decreased demand for retail space at certain of our properties or in extreme cases our inability to operate the properties at all climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of or making unavailable insurance on favorable terms or at all increasing the cost of energy at our properties or requiring us to spend funds to repair and protect our properties against such risks moreover compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change including compliance with “green” building codes may require us to make improvements to our existing properties or increase taxes and fees assessed on us or our properties 

other factors affecting our business 

some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance 

we maintain insurance coverage with thirdparty carriers who provide a portion of the coverage for specific layers of potential losses including commercial general liability fire flood extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties in the united states the initial portion of coverage not provided by thirdparty carriers is either insured through our whollyowned captive insurance company or other financial arrangements controlled by us a third party carrier has in turn agreed to provide if required evidence of coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carrier’s policy a similar policy either written through our captive insurance company or other financial arrangements controlled by us also provides initial coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal windstorm locations 

there are some types of losses including lease and other contract claims which generally are not insured or are subject to large deductibles if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue it could generate but may remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligation related to the property 

we currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the united states on an “all risk” basis in the amount of up to 1 billion despite the existence of this insurance coverage any threatened or actual terrorist attacks where we operate could materially and adversely affect us 

 

we face risks associated with security breaches through cyber‑attacks cyber intrusions or otherwise as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology it networks and related systems 

our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform daytoday operations and in some cases may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants we face risks associated with security breaches whether through cyberattacks or cyber intrusions over the internet malware computer viruses hardware or software corruption or failure or poor product or vendordeveloper selection including a failure of security controls incorporated into or applied to such hardware or software service provider error or failure intentional or unintentional actions by employees including the failure to follow our security protocols and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging even the most well protected information networks systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed not to be detected and in fact may not be detected accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk 

a breach or significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our systems including our primary website could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers tenants and revenues generate third party claims result in the unintended andor unauthorized public disclosure or the misappropriation of proprietary personal identifying and confidential information and require us to incur significant expenses to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues and we may not be able to recover these expenses in whole or in any part from our service providers or responsible parties or their or our insurers 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain talented employees and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our business 

the success of our business depends in part on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees and our ability to attract retain and motivate talented employees could significantly impact our future performance competition for these individuals is intense and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive management team and other key employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on us 

provisions in simon’s charter and by‑laws and in the operating partnership’s partnership agreement could prevent a change of control 

simon’s charter contains a general restriction on the accumulation of shares in excess of 8 of its capital stock the charter permits the members of the simon family and related persons to own up to 18 of simon’s capital stock ownership is determined by the lower of the number of outstanding shares voting power or value controlled simon’s board of directors may by majority vote permit exceptions to those levels in circumstances where simon’s board of directors determines that simon’s ability to qualify as a reit will not be jeopardized these restrictions on ownership may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interest of simon’s stockholders or the operating partnership’s unitholders or preferred unitholders other provisions of simon’s charter and bylaws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control even if some of simon’s stockholders or the operating partnership’s unitholders or preferred unitholders deem such a change to be in their best interests these include provisions preventing holders of simon’s common stock from acting by written consent and requiring that up to four directors in the aggregate may be elected by holders of class b common stock in addition certain provisions of the operating partnership’s partnership agreement could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control these include a provision requiring the consent of a majority in interest of units in order for simon as general partner of the operating partnership to among other matters engage in a merger transaction or sell all or substantially all of its assets 

the united kingdom’s pending departure from the european union could have a material adverse effect on us 

following a national referendum in june 2016 the united kingdom formally notified the european council on march 29 2017 of its intention to withdraw from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” the timing of the proposed exit is currently scheduled for march 29 2019 with a transition period running through december 2020 a 

 

withdrawal plan was presented to the uk parliament in january 2019 and rejected creating further uncertainty in negotiations and the process of withdrawal the terms governing the future relationship between the united kingdom and the eu as well as the legal and economic consequences of those terms remain unclear this continues to create political and economic uncertainty which has affected and may continue to affect market and macroeconomic conditions in both the united kingdom and eu economies in particular there may be ongoing and increased volatility in financial and foreign exchange markets in the united kingdom and eu including a fall in gross domestic product and volatility in the value of pounds sterling further financial and other markets may suffer losses as a result of any other countries determining to withdraw from the eu or from any future significant changes to the eu’s structure andor regulations 

we currently hold and may acquire additional equity interests in properties located in the united kingdom and europe as well as other investments that are denominated in pounds sterling and euro in addition our operating partnership and its subsidiaries have issued and may issue in the future senior unsecured notes denominated in euro any of the effects of brexit described above and others we cannot anticipate could have a material adverse effect on us including the value of our properties and investments and our potential growth in europe as well as on our tenants’ businesses and could amplify the currency risks faced by us

we also grow by generating supplemental revenues from the following activities 



 









we focus on high quality real estate across the retail real estate spectrum we expand or redevelop properties to enhance profitability and market share of existing assets when we believe the investment of our capital meets our risk‑reward criteria we selectively develop new properties in markets we believe are not adequately served by existing retail outlet properties 

we routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio our international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk 

to support our growth we employ a three‑fold capital strategy 







we consider ffo net operating income or noi portfolio noi and comparable property noi noi for properties owned and operated in both periods under comparison to be key measures of operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or gaap we use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure are included below in this discussion 

results overview 

diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per unit increased 163 during 2018 to 787 as compared to 624 in 2017 the increase in diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per unit was primarily attributable to 



















solid core business fundamentals during 2018 were primarily driven by strong leasing activity portfolio noi grew by 37 in 2018 as compared to 2017 comparable property noi grew 23 for our portfolio of us malls premium 

 

outlets and the mills total sales per square foot or psf increased to 661 psf at december 31 2018 from 628 psf at december 31 2017 for our us malls and premium outlets average base minimum rent for us malls and premium outlets increased 20 to 5418 psf as of december 31 2018 from 5311 psf as of december 31 2017 leasing spreads in our us malls and premium outlets were positive as we were able to lease available square feet at higher rents resulting in an openclose leasing spread based on total tenant payments — base minimum rent plus common area maintenance of 775 psf 6204 openings compared to 5429 closings as of december 31 2018 representing a 143 increase ending occupancy for our us malls and premium outlets increased 03 to 959 as of december 31 2018 from 956 as of december 31 2017 

our effective overall borrowing rate at december 31 2018 on our consolidated indebtedness increased 10 basis points to 335 as compared to 325 at december 31 2017 this increase was primarily due to an increase in the effective overall borrowing rate on variable rate debt of 98 basis points 317 at december 31 2018 as compared to 219 at december 31 2017 combined with an increase in the effective overall borrowing rate on fixed rate debt of seven basis points 337 at december 31 2018 as compared to 330 at december 31 2017 partially offset by a decrease in the amount of both fixed and variable rate debt the weighted average years to maturity of our consolidated indebtedness was 64 years and 70 years at december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively 

our financing activity for the year ended december 31 2018 and material subsequent events included 















united states portfolio data 

the portfolio data discussed in this overview includes the following key operating statistics ending occupancy average base minimum rent per square foot and total sales per square foot for our domestic assets we include acquired properties in this data beginning in the year of acquisition and remove disposed properties in the year of disposition for comparative information purposes we separate the information related to the mills from our other us operations we also do not include any information for properties located outside the united states 

 

the following table sets forth these key operating statistics for the combined us malls and premium outlets 











ending occupancy levels and average base minimum rent per square foot ending occupancy is the percentage of gross leasable area or gla which is leased as of the last day of the reporting period we include all company owned space except for mall anchors mall majors mall freestanding and mall outlots in the calculation base minimum rent per square foot is the average base minimum rent charge in effect for the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in ending occupancy 

total sales per square foot total sales include total reported retail tenant sales on a trailing 12‑month basis at owned gla for mall stores with less than 10000 square feet in the malls and the mills and stores with less than 20000 square feet in the premium outlets retail sales at owned gla affect revenue and profitability levels because sales determine the amount of minimum rent that can be charged the percentage rent realized and the recoverable expenses common area maintenance real estate taxes etc that tenants can afford to pay 

current leasing activities 

during 2018 we signed 900 new leases and 1183 renewal leases excluding mall anchors and majors new development redevelopment and leases with terms of one year or less with a fixed minimum rent across our us malls and premium outlets portfolio comprising approximately 71 million square feet of which 53 million square feet related to consolidated properties during 2017 we signed 849 new leases and 1302 renewal leases with a fixed minimum rent comprising approximately 67 million square feet of which 50 million square feet related to consolidated properties the average annual initial base minimum rent for new leases was 5729 per square foot in 2018 and 5860 per square foot in 2017 with an average tenant allowance on new leases of 5421 per square foot and 5053 per square foot respectively

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

liquidity and capital resources 

because we own long‑lived income‑producing assets our financing strategy relies primarily on long‑term fixed rate debt floating rate debt comprised only 35 of our total consolidated debt at december 31 2018 we also enter into interest rate protection agreements from time to time to manage our interest rate risk we derive most of our liquidity from positive net cash flow from operations and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities that totaled 42 billion in the aggregate during 2018 the operating partnership has a 40 billion credit facility and a 35 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility or supplemental facility and together with the credit facility the credit facilities the credit facilities and the commercial paper program provide alternative sources of liquidity as our cash needs vary from time to time borrowing capacity under these sources may be increased as discussed further below 

our balance of cash and cash equivalents decreased 9680 million during 2018 to 5143 million as of december 31 2018 as further discussed in “cash flows” below 

on december 31 2018 we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of approximately 66 billion under the credit facilities net of outstanding borrowings of 1250 million amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program of 7587 million and letters of credit of 113 million for the year ended december 31 2018 the maximum aggregate outstanding balance under the credit facilities was 4231 million and the weighted average outstanding balance was 2381 million the weighted average interest rate was 180 for the year ended december 31 2018 

simon has historically had access to public equity markets and the operating partnership has historically had access to private and public short and longterm unsecured debt markets and access to secured debt and private equity from institutional investors at the property level 

our business model and simon’s status as a reit require us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition development and redevelopment activity and to refinance maturing debt simon may also from time to time access the equity capital markets to accomplish our business objectives we believe we have sufficient cash on hand and availability under the credit facilities and the commercial paper program to address our debt maturities and capital needs through 2019 

cash flows 

our net cash flow from operating activities and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities totaled 42 billion during 2018 in addition we had net repayments from our debt financing and repayment activities of 11 billion in 2018 these activities are further discussed below under “financing and debt” during 2018 we also 











 



in general we anticipate that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating expenses monthly debt service recurring capital expenditures and dividends to stockholders andor distributions to partners necessary to maintain simon’s reit qualification on a long‑term basis in addition we expect to be able to generate or obtain capital for nonrecurring capital expenditures such as acquisitions major building redevelopments and expansions as well as for scheduled principal maturities on outstanding indebtedness from 









we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2019 and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash these cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our tenants a significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds from the credit facilities and commercial paper program curtail planned capital expenditures or seek other additional sources of financing as discussed above

determine it is in our best interests for us to purchase the joint venture interest and we believe we have adequate liquidity to execute the purchase without hindering our cash flows then we may initiate these provisions or elect to buy our partner’s interest if we decide to sell any of our joint venture interests we expect to use the net proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness or to reinvest in development redevelopment or expansion opportunities

we typically reinvest net cash flow from our international joint ventures to fund future international development activity we believe this strategy mitigates some of the risk of our initial investment and our exposure to changes in foreign currencies we have also funded most of our foreign investments with local currency‑denominated borrowings that act as a natural hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates our consolidated net income exposure to changes in the volatility of the euro yen won and other foreign currencies is not material we expect our share of international development costs for 2019 will be approximately 180 million primarily funded through reinvested joint venture cash flow and construction loans 

the following table describes recently completed and new development and expansion projects as well as our share of the estimated total cost as of december 31 2018 in millions 





dividends distributions and stock repurchase program 

simon paid a common stock dividend of 200 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 790 per share for the year ended december 31 2018 the operating partnership paid distributions per unit for the same amounts in 2017 simon paid dividends of 185 and 715 per share for the three and twelve month periods ended december 31 2017 respectively the operating partnership paid distributions per unit for the same amounts simon’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend for the first quarter of 2019 of 205 per share of common stock payable on february 28 2019 to stockholders of record on february 14 2019 the distribution rate on units is equal to the dividend rate on common stock in order to maintain its status as a reit simon must pay a minimum amount of dividends simon’s future dividends and the operating partnership’s future distributions will be determined by simon’s board of directors in its sole discretion based on actual and projected financial condition liquidity and results of operations cash available for dividends and limited partner distributions cash reserves as deemed necessary for capital and operating expenditures financing covenants if any and the amount required to maintain simon’s status as a reit 

on april 2 2015 simon’s board of directors authorized simon to repurchase up to 20 billion of common stock over a twentyfour month period as market conditions warrant and on february 13 2017 simon’s board of directors authorized a twoyear extension of the program through march 31 2019 simon may repurchase the shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as market conditions warrant during the year ended december 31 2018 simon repurchased 2275194 shares at an average price of 15564 per share of its common stock as part of this program 

 

during the year ended december 31 2017 simon repurchased 2468630 shares at an average price of 16487 per share as part of this program at december 31 2018 we had remaining authority to repurchase approximately 6406 million of common stock as simon repurchases shares under this program the operating partnership repurchases an equal number of units from simon 

on february 11 2019 simons board of directors authorized a new common stock repurchase plan under the new program the company may purchase up to 20 billion of its common stock during the twoyear period ending february 11 2021 

forward‑looking statements 

certain statements made in this section or elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k may be deemed forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 although we believe the expectations reflected in any forwardlooking statements are based on reasonable assumptions we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained and it is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forwardlooking statements due to a variety of risks uncertainties and other factors such factors include but are not limited to changes in economic and market conditions that may adversely affect the general retail environment the potential loss of anchor stores or major tenants the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise decreases in market rental rates the intensely competitive market environment in the retail industry the inability to lease newly developed properties and renew leases and relet space at existing properties on favorable terms risks related to international activities including without limitation the impact if any of the united kingdom’s exit from the european union changes to applicable laws or regulations or the interpretation thereof risks associated with the acquisition development redevelopment expansion leasing and management of properties general risks related to real estate investments including the illiquidity of real estate investments the impact of our substantial indebtedness on our future operations any disruption in the financial markets that may adversely affect our ability to access capital for growth and satisfy our ongoing debt service requirements any change in our credit rating changes in market rates of interest and foreign exchange rates for foreign currencies changes in the value of our investments in foreign entities our ability to hedge interest rate and currency risk our continued ability to maintain our status as a reit changes in tax laws or regulations that result in adverse tax consequences risks relating to our joint venture properties environmental liabilities changes in insurance costs the availability of comprehensive insurance coverage security breaches that could compromise our information technology or infrastructure natural disasters the potential for terrorist activities and the loss of key management personnel we discussed these and other risks and uncertainties under the heading risk factors in part i item1a of this annual report on form 10k we may update that discussion in subsequent other periodic reports but except as required by law we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise these forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise 

non‑gaap financial measures 

industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties in part based on performance measures such as ffo diluted ffo per share noi portfolio noi and comparable property noi we believe that these non‑gaap measures are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of reits and provide a relevant basis for comparison among reits we also use these measures internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio 

we determine ffo based on the definition set forth by the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit as consolidated net income computed in accordance with gaap 













 

we have adopted nareit’s clarification of the definition of ffo that requires us to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary cumulative effect of accounting changes or a gain or loss resulting from the sale disposal or property insurance recoveries of or any impairment related to previously depreciated retail operating properties 

we include in ffo gains and losses realized from the sale of land outlot buildings equity instruments and investment holdings of non‑retail real estate we also include in ffo the impact of foreign currency exchange gains and losses legal expenses transaction expenses and other items required by gaap 

you should understand that our computations of these non‑gaap measures might not be comparable to similar measures reported by other reits and that these non‑gaap measures 







 

the following schedule reconciles total ffo to consolidated net income and for simon diluted net income per share to diluted ffo per share 







 

the following schedule reconciles consolidated net income to noi and sets forth the computations of portfolio noi and comparable property noi 











 

item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our long‑term debt obligations we manage exposure to interest rate market risk through our risk management strategy by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of variable rate debt we are also exposed to foreign currency risk on financings of certain foreign operations our intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging these exposures we do not enter into either interest rate protection or foreign currency rate protection agreements for speculative purposes 

we may enter into treasury lock agreements as part of anticipated issuances of senior notes upon completion of the debt issuance the cost of these instruments is recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt agreement 

our future earnings cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest primarily libor based upon consolidated indebtedness and interest rates at december 31 2018 a 50 basis point increase in the market rates of interest would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 43 million and would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately 6207 million

for a description of our operational strategies and developments in our business during 2017 see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10‑k 

other policies 

the following is a discussion of our investment policies financing policies conflict of interest policies and policies with respect to certain other activities one or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote 

investment policies 

while we emphasize equity real estate investments we may also provide secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers consistent with simon’s qualification as a reit however any of these investments would be subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for reit qualification these reit limitations mean that simon cannot make an investment that would cause its real estate assets to be less than 75 of its total assets simon must also derive at least 75 of its gross income directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including “rents from real property” dividends from other reits and in certain circumstances interest from certain types of temporary investments in addition simon must also derive at least 95 of its gross income from such real property investments and from dividends interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing 

subject to simon’s reit limitations we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate such an investment would normally be in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties we may in the future acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies 

 

financing policies 

because simon’s reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of its reit taxable income we regularly access the debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions develop and redevelop properties and refinance maturing debt we must comply with the covenants contained in our financing agreements that limit our ratio of debt to total assets or market value as defined for example the operating partnership’s lines of credit and the indentures for the operating partnership’s debt securities contain covenants that restrict the total amount of debt of the operating partnership to 65 or 60 in relation to certain debt of total assets as defined under the related agreements and secured debt to 50 of total assets in addition these agreements contain other covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios furthermore the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for the debt securities of the operating partnership we strive to maintain investment grade ratings at all times for various business reasons including their effect on our ability to access attractive capital but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so in the future 

if simon’s board of directors determines to seek additional capital we may raise such capital by offering equity or incurring debt creating joint ventures with existing ownership interests in properties entering into joint venture arrangements for new development projects retaining cash flows or a combination of these methods if simon’s board of directors determines to raise equity capital it may without stockholder approval issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock simon’s board of directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital or may issue units in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate we may also raise additional capital by issuing common units of partnership interest in the operating partnership or units such securities also may include additional classes of simon’s preferred stock or preferred units of partnership interest in the operating partnership or preferred units which may be convertible into common stock or units as the case may be existing stockholders and unitholders have no preemptive right to purchase shares or units in any subsequent issuances of securities by us any issuance of equity could dilute a stockholder’s investment in simon or a limited partner’s investment in the operating partnership 

we expect most future borrowings will be made through the operating partnership or its subsidiaries we might however incur borrowings through other entities that would be reloaned to the operating partnership borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings publicly and privately placed debt instruments or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties any such indebtedness may be secured or unsecured any such indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to the borrower or be cross‑collateralized with other debt or may be fully or partially guaranteed by the operating partnership we issue unsecured debt securities through the operating partnership but we may issue other debt securities which may be convertible into common or preferred stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase common or preferred stock we also may sell or securitize our lease receivables although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends we currently have no expectation that we will regularly do so 

the operating partnership has a 40 billion unsecured revolving credit facility or credit facility on march 17 2017 the operating partnership amended and extended the credit facility the credit facility’s initial borrowing capacity of 40 billion may be increased to 50 billion during its term the initial maturity date of the credit facility was extended to june 30 2021 and can be extended for an additional year to june 30 2022 at our sole option subject to our continued compliance with the terms thereof the base interest rate on the credit facility was reduced to libor plus 775 basis points from libor plus 80 basis points with a facility fee of 10 basis points the operating partnership also has a 35 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility or supplemental facility and together with the credit facility the credit facilities the supplemental facility’s initial borrowing capacity of 35 billion may be increased to 425 billion during its term the initial maturity date of the supplemental facility is june 30 2019 which can be extended for an additional year to june 30 2020 at our sole option subject to our continued compliance with the terms thereof the base interest rate on the supplemental facility is libor plus 80 basis points with an additional facility fee of 10 basis points the credit facilities provide for borrowings denominated in us dollars euro yen sterling canadian dollars and australian dollars 

on february 15 2018 the operating partnership amended and extended the supplemental facility the supplemental facility’s initial borrowing capacity of 35 billion may be increased to 45 billion during its term the initial maturity date of the supplemental facility was extended to june 30 2022 and can be extended for an additional year to june 30 2023 at our sole option subject to our continued compliance with the terms thereof the base interest rate on the supplemental facility was reduced to libor plus 775 basis points from libor plus 80 basis points with a facility fee of 10 basis points 

the operating partnership also has available a global unsecured commercial paper note program or the commercial paper program of 10 billion or the non‑us dollar equivalent thereof the operating partnership may issue 

 

unsecured commercial paper notes denominated in us dollars euro and other currencies notes issued in non‑us currencies may be issued by one or more subsidiaries of the operating partnership and are guaranteed by the operating partnership these notes are sold under customary terms in the us and euro commercial paper note markets and rank either by themselves or as a result of the guarantee described above pari passu with the operating partnership’s other unsecured senior indebtedness the commercial paper program is supported by the credit facilities and if necessary or appropriate we may make one or more draws under either credit facility to pay amounts outstanding from time to time on the commercial paper program 

we may also finance our business through the following 















the operating partnership may also issue units to contributors of properties or other partnership interests which may permit the contributor to defer tax gain recognition under the internal revenue code 

we do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property mortgage financing instruments however typically limit additional indebtedness on such properties additionally the credit facilities our unsecured note indentures and other contracts may limit our ability to borrow and contain limits on mortgage indebtedness we may incur as well as certain financial covenants we must maintain 

typically we invest in or form special purpose entities to assist us in obtaining secured permanent financing at attractive terms permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage loan on a single property or on a group of properties and generally requires us to provide a mortgage lien on the property or properties in favor of an institutional third party as a joint venture with a third party or as a securitized financing for securitized financings we create special purpose entities to own the properties these special purpose entities which are common in the real estate industry are structured so that they would not be consolidated in a bankruptcy proceeding involving a parent company we decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives for accounting purposes we include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness 

conflict of interest policies 

we maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest simon has adopted governance principles governing the function conduct selection orientation and duties of its subsidiaries and simon’s board of directors and the company as well as written charters for each of the standing committees of simon’s board of directors in addition simon’s board of directors has a code of business conduct and ethics which applies to all of its officers directors and employees and those of its subsidiaries at least a majority of the members of simon’s board of directors must qualify as independent under the listing standards of the new york stock exchange or nyse and cannot be affiliated with the simon family who are significant stockholders andor unitholders in the operating partnership in addition the audit and compensation committees of simon’s board of directors are comprised entirely of independent members who meet the additional independence and financial expert requirements of the nyse any transaction between us and the simon family including property acquisitions service and property management agreements and retail space leases must be approved by a majority of simon’s nonaffiliated directors 

the sale by the operating partnership of any property that it owns may have an adverse tax impact on the simon family or other limited partners of the operating partnership in order to avoid any conflict of interest the simon charter requires that at least threefourths of simon’s independent directors must authorize and require the operating partnership to sell any property it owns any such sale is subject to applicable agreements with third parties noncompetition agreements executed by david simon simon’s chairman and chief executive officer and herbert simon simon’s 

 

chairman emeritus as well as david simons employment agreement contain covenants limiting their ability to participate in certain shopping center activities 

policies with respect to certain other activities 

we intend to make investments which are consistent with simon’s qualification as a reit unless simon’s board of directors determines that it is no longer in simon’s best interests to so qualify as a reit simon’s board of directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the reit requirements simon has authority to issue shares of its capital stock or other securities in exchange for property we also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares our units or any other securities on february 13 2017 simon’s board of directors authorized a twoyear extension of the previously authorized 20 billion common stock repurchase plan or the repurchase program through march 31 2019 under the repurchase program simon may repurchase the shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at december 31 2017 we had remaining authority to repurchase 10 billion of common stock simon may also issue shares of its common stock or pay cash at its option to holders of units in future periods upon exercise of such holders’ rights under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership our policy prohibits us from making any loans to the directors or executive officers of simon for any purpose we may make loans to the joint ventures in which we participate additionally we may make or buy interests in loans secured by real estate properties owned by others or make investments in companies that own real estate assets 

competition 

the retail real estate industry is dynamic and competitive we compete with numerous merchandise distribution channels including malls outlet centers communitylifestyle centers and other shopping centers in the united states and abroad we also compete with internet retailing sites and catalogs which provide retailers with distribution options beyond existing brick and mortar retail properties the existence of competitive alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we can obtain this results in competition for both the tenants to occupy the properties that we develop and manage as well as for the acquisition of prime sites including land for development and operating properties we believe that there are numerous factors that make our properties highly desirable to retailers including

 item 1a risk factors 

the following factors among others could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward‑looking statements made in this annual report on form 10‑k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations funds from operations or ffo and prospects which we refer to herein as a material adverse effect on us or as materially and adversely affecting us and you should carefully consider them additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which are currently not believed to be material may also affect our actual results we may update these factors in our future periodic reports 

risks relating to retail operations 

overall economic and market conditions may adversely affect the general retail environment 

our concentration in the retail real estate market means that we are subject to a number of factors that could adversely affect the retail environment generally including without limitation 























we derive our operating results primarily from retail tenants many of whom have been and continue to be under some degree of economic stress a significant deterioration in the creditworthiness of our retail tenants could have a material adverse effect on us 

some of our properties depend on anchor stores or other major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more of these anchor stores or major tenants 

our properties are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally recognized tenants the value of some of our properties could be materially and adversely affected if these anchors or other major tenants fail to comply with their contractual obligations or cease their operations 

for example among department stores and other large stores — often referred to as “big box” stores — corporate merger activity typically results in the closure of duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations further sustained adverse pressure on the results of our department stores and major tenants may have a similarly sustained adverse impact upon our own results certain department stores and other national retailers have experienced and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future given current macroeconomic uncertainty and less‑than‑desirable levels of consumer confidence considerable decreases in customer traffic in their retail stores increased competition from alternative retail options such as those accessible via the internet and other forms of pressure on their business models as pressure on these department stores and national retailers increases their ability to maintain their stores meet their obligations both to us and to their external lenders and suppliers withstand takeover attempts by investors or rivals or avoid bankruptcy andor liquidation may be impaired and result in closures of their stores or their seeking of a lease modification with us any lease modification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and could decrease rents or expense recovery charges other tenants 

 

may be entitled to modify the economic or other terms of or terminate their existing leases with us in the event of such closures 

if a department store or major tenant were to close its stores at our properties we may experience difficulty and delay and incur significant expense in replacing the tenant as well as in leasing spaces in areas adjacent to the vacant department store or major tenant at attractive rates or at all additionally department store or major tenant closures may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sales at our properties if the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to the closing of anchor stores or other national retailers adverse economic conditions or other reasons tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges in the event of any default by a tenant we may not be able to fully recover andor may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with such parties 

we face potential adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies 

bankruptcy filings by retailers can occur regularly in the course of our operations if a tenant files for bankruptcy the tenant may have the right to reject and terminate one or more of its leases with us and we cannot be sure that it will affirm one or more of its leases and continue to make rental payments to us in a timely manner a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants would bar all efforts by us to collect pre‑bankruptcy debts from that tenant or from their property unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court in addition we cannot evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy if a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy all pre‑bankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full however if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages in connection with such balances if a bankrupt tenant vacates a space it might not do so in a timely manner and we might be unable to re‑lease the vacated space during that time at attractive rates or at all furthermore we may be required to incur significant expense in replacing the bankrupt tenant any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims and there are restrictions under bankruptcy laws that limit the amount of the claim we can make if a lease is rejected as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold we continually seek to re‑lease vacant spaces resulting from tenant terminations the bankruptcy of a tenant particularly an anchor tenant or a national tenant with multiple locations may make the re‑leasing of their space difficult and costly and it also may be more difficult to lease the remainder of the space at the affected properties future tenant bankruptcies may impact our ability to successfully execute our re‑leasing strategy and could materially and adversely affect us 

we face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably 

our properties compete with other retail properties and other forms of retailing such as catalogs and e‑commerce websites competition may come from malls outlet centers communitylifestyle centers and other shopping centers both existing as well as future development and redevelopmentexpansion projects as well as catalogs and e‑commerce the presence of competitive alternatives affects our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain new construction renovations and expansions at competing sites could also negatively affect our properties 

we also compete with other major real estate investors and developers for attractive investment opportunities and prime development sites competition for the acquisition of existing properties and development sites may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect our ability to make attractive investments on favorable terms or at all in addition we compete with other retail property companies for tenants and qualified management 

we may not be able to lease newly developed properties and renew leases and relet space at existing properties 

we may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants also when leases for our existing properties expire the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms to the extent that our leasing goals are not achieved we could be materially and adversely affected 

  

 

risks relating to real estate investments and operations 

our international activities may subject us to different or greater risk from those associated with our domestic operations 

as of december 31 2017 we held interests in consolidated and joint venture properties that operate in austria france italy germany japan malaysia mexico the netherlands south korea canada and the united kingdom we also have an equity stake in klépierre a publicly‑traded european real estate company which operates in 16 countries in europe accordingly our operating results and the value of our international operations may be impacted by any unhedged movements in the foreign currencies in which those operations transact and in which our net investment in the international operation is held we may pursue additional investment development and redevelopmentexpansion opportunities outside the united states international investment ownership development and redevelopmentexpansion activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our domestic properties and operations these risks include but are not limited to 



















our international activities represented approximately 51 of consolidated net income and 90 of our net operating income or noi for the year ended december 31 2017 to the extent that we expand our international activities the above risks could increase in significance which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us 

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations that could adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability 

our properties are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to varying judicial or regulatory interpretations these laws and regulations may include zoning laws building codes competition laws rules and agreements landlordtenant laws property tax regulations changes in real estate assessments and other laws and regulations generally applicable to business operations noncompliance with such laws and regulations and any associated litigation could expose us to liability 

we face risks associated with the acquisition development redevelopment and expansion of properties 

we regularly acquire and develop new properties and redevelop and expand existing properties and these activities are subject to various risks we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition development or redevelopmentexpansion opportunities in addition newly acquired developed or redevelopedexpanded properties may not perform as well as expected impacting our anticipated return on investment we are subject to other risks in connection with any acquisition development and redevelopmentexpansion activities including the following 









 





if a development or redevelopmentexpansion project is unsuccessful either because it is not meeting our expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project planning we could lose our investment in the project further if we guarantee the property’s financing our loss could exceed our investment in the project 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid 

our properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets these investments are relatively illiquid as a result our ability to sell one or more of our properties or investments in real estate in response to any changes in economic industry or other conditions may be limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability and terms of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand for space that are beyond our control if we want to sell a property we cannot assure you that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or at all or that the sales price of a property will be attractive at the relevant time or even exceed the carrying value of our investment moreover if a property is mortgaged we may not be able to obtain a release of the lien on that property without the payment of the associated debt andor a substantial prepayment penalty which could restrict our ability to dispose of the property even though the sale might otherwise be desirable 

risks relating to debt and the financial markets 

we have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations 

as of december 31 2017 our consolidated mortgages and unsecured indebtedness excluding related premium discount and debt issuance costs totaled 247 billion as a result of this indebtedness we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows for debt service including selected repayment at scheduled maturities which limits our ability to use those cash flows to fund the growth of our business we are also subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flows from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service or that we will be able to refinance such indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the applicable property such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants cause a reduction in the income from the property our indebtedness could also have other adverse consequences on us including reducing our access to capital or increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic industry and market conditions in addition if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value if any of the foregoing occurs we could be materially and adversely affected 

disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements 

we depend on external financings principally debt financings to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt our access to financing depends on the willingness of lending institutions and other debt investors to grant credit to us and conditions in the capital markets in general an economic recession may cause extreme volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets we rely upon the credit facilities as sources of funding for numerous transactions our access to these funds is dependent upon the ability of each of the participants to the credit facilities to meet their funding commitments to us when markets are volatile access to capital and credit markets could be disrupted over an extended period of time and one or more financial institutions may not have the available capital to meet their previous commitments to us the failure of one or more participants to the credit facilities to meet their funding commitments to us could have a material adverse effect on us including as a result of making it difficult to obtain the financing we may need for future growth andor meeting our debt service requirements we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for the future growth of our business or to meet our debt service requirements or that a sufficient amount of financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 

adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

the operating partnership’s outstanding senior unsecured notes credit facilities the commercial paper program and simon’s preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios financial condition and prospects and other factors 

 

viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and the economic outlook in general our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund the growth of our business an adverse change in our credit rating including actual changes and changes in outlook or even the initiation of a review of our credit rating that could result in an adverse change could have a material adverse effect on us 

the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that might affect our ability to operate freely 

we have a variety of unsecured debt including the credit facilities and secured property‑level debt certain of the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain covenants including among other things limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured indebtedness sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and certain acquisitions in addition certain of the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain financial covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios including certain coverage ratios these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous to us in addition our ability to comply with these provisions might be affected by events beyond our control failure to comply with any of our financing covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate the related indebtedness as well as other of our indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on us 

our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk 

we selectively manage our exposure to interest rate risk by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap all or a portion of our variable rate debt in addition we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and other terms are appropriate our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful 

our use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations or that we could be required to fund our contractual payment obligations under such arrangements in relatively large amounts or on short notice developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs 

risks relating to income taxes 

simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership have elected to be taxed as reits in the united states and certain international operations also are structured to be taxed in a manner similar to the reit structure the failure to maintain simon’s or these subsidiaries’ qualifications as reits or changes in local tax laws or regulations in certain of our international operations could result in adverse tax consequences 

we are subject to certain incomebased taxes both domestically and internationally and other taxes including state and local taxes franchise taxes and withholding taxes on dividends from certain of our international investments we currently follow local tax laws and regulations in various domestic and international jurisdictions should these laws or regulations change the amount of taxes we pay may increase accordingly 

in the united states simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership have elected to be taxed as reits under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code we believe simon and these subsidiaries have been organized and operated in a manner which allows them to qualify for taxation as reits under the internal revenue code we intend to continue to operate in this manner however qualification and taxation as reits depend upon the ability of simon and these subsidiaries to satisfy several requirements some of which are outside our control including tests related to our annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various reit qualification tests required by the internal revenue code are highly technical and complex accordingly there can be no assurance that simon or any of these subsidiaries has operated in accordance with these requirements or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

if simon or any of these subsidiaries fail to comply with those provisions simon or any such subsidiary may be subject to monetary penalties or ultimately to possible disqualification as reits if such events occur and if available relief provisions do not apply 

 







any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for among other things our operations and distributions to stockholders in addition if simon fails to qualify as a reit it will not be required to make distributions to our stockholders moreover a failure by any subsidiary of the operating partnership that has elected to be taxed as a reit to qualify as a reit would also cause simon to fail to qualify as a reit and the same adverse consequences would apply to it and its stockholders failure by simon or any of these subsidiaries to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital which could materially and adversely affect us  

the tax imposed on reits engaging in “prohibited transactions” may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for us federal income tax purposes 

a reit’s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100 penalty tax in general prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the irs would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors 

reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan 

in order for simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership to qualify to be taxed as reits and assuming that certain other requirements are also satisfied simon and each such subsidiary generally must distribute at least 90 of their respective reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains to their respective equity holders each year to this point simon and each such subsidiary have historically distributed at least 100 of taxable income and thereby avoided income tax altogether to the extent that simon or any such subsidiary satisfies this distribution requirement and qualifies for taxation as a reit but distributes less than 100 of its reit taxable income simon or any such subsidiary will be subject to us federal corporate income tax on its undistributed net taxable income and could be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that is distributed to equity holders in a calendar year is less than “the required minimum distribution amount” specified under us federal income tax laws we intend to make distributions to the equity holders of simon and the aforementioned subsidiaries of the operating partnership to comply with the reit requirements of the internal revenue code 

from time to time simon and the aforementioned subsidiaries of the operating partnership might generate taxable income greater than their respective cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments if simon and these subsidiaries do not have other funds available in these situations simon and these subsidiaries could be required to access capital on unfavorable terms the receipt of which cannot be assured sell assets at disadvantageous prices distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions capital expenditures or repayment of debt or make taxable distributions of capital stock or debt securities to make distributions sufficient to enable them to pay out enough of their respective reit taxable income to satisfy the reit distribution requirement and avoid corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase costs or reduce our equity further amounts distributed will not be available to fund the growth of our business thus compliance with the reit requirements may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan 

 

complying with reit requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive acquisition opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments 

to qualify to be taxed as reits for us federal income tax purposes simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of their respective assets consist of cash cash items government securities and “real estate assets” as defined in the internal revenue code including certain mortgage loans and securities the remainder of their respective investments other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable reit subsidiary or trs generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer 

additionally in general no more than 5 of the value of simon’s and these subsidiaries’ total assets other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a trs can consist of the securities of any one issuer and no more than 25 20 for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 of the value of their respective total assets can be represented by securities of one or more trss if simon or any of these subsidiaries fails to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter simon or any such subsidiary must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing its reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences as a result we might be required to liquidate or forego otherwise attractive investments these actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to equity holders 

in addition to the asset tests set forth above to qualify to be taxed as reits simon and these subsidiaries must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of their respective income the amounts they distribute to equity holders and the ownership of their respective shares we might be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the source‑of‑income or asset‑diversification requirements for qualifying as reits thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments 

partnership tax audit rules could have a material adverse effect on us 

the bipartisan budget act of 2015 changes the rules applicable to us federal income tax audits of partnerships under the rules which are generally effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 among other changes and subject to certain exceptions any audit adjustment to items of income gain loss deduction or credit of a partnership and any partner’s distributive share thereof is determined and taxes interest or penalties attributable thereto could be assessed and collected at the partnership level although it is uncertain how these rules will be implemented it is possible that they could result in partnerships in which we directly or indirectly invest being required to pay additional taxes interest and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment and we as a direct or indirect partner of these partnerships could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes interest and penalties even though simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership as reits may not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporate‑level taxes had they owned the assets of the partnership directly the partnership tax audit rules will apply to the operating partnership and its subsidiaries that are classified as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes the changes created by these rules are sweeping and accordingly there can be no assurance that these rules will not have a material adverse effect on us 

legislative administrative regulatory or other actions affecting reits including positions taken by the irs could have a material adverse effect on us and our investors 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us department of the treasury or the treasury changes to the tax laws or interpretations thereof by the irs and the treasury with or without retroactive application could materially and adversely affect us and our investors new legislation including the recently enacted tax cuts and jobs act and any technical corrections legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect the ability of simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership to qualify to be taxed as reits andor the us federal income tax consequences to us and our investors of such qualification 

 

risks relating to joint ventures 

we have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance them 

as of december 31 2017 we owned interests in 100 income‑producing properties with other parties of those 19 properties are included in our consolidated financial statements we account for the other 81 properties or the joint venture properties as well as our investments in klépierre a publicly traded parisbased real estate company aéropostale and hbs global properties or hbs using the equity method of accounting we serve as general partner or property manager for 58 of these 81 joint venture properties however certain major decisions such as approving the operating budget and selling refinancing and redeveloping the properties require the consent of the other owners of the joint venture properties for which we do not serve as general partner or property manager 19 are in our international joint ventures these international properties are managed locally by joint ventures in which we share control of the properties with our partner the other owners have participating rights that we consider substantive for purposes of determining control over the joint venture properties’ assets the remaining joint venture properties klépierre and our joint ventures with aéropostale and hbs are managed by third parties 

these investments and other future similar investments could involve risks that would not be present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or other owners might become bankrupt suffer a deterioration in their creditworthiness or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or other owners could have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our own business interests or goals and could be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives 

these investments and other future similar investments also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions such as a sale or financing because neither we nor our partner or other owner has full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or other owners might result in litigation or arbitration that could increase our expenses and prevent simon’s officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or other owners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we risk the possibility of being liable for the actions of our partners or other owners 

the operating partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties 

joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property which is non‑recourse to us nevertheless the joint venture’s failure to satisfy its debt obligations could result in the loss of our investment therein as of december 31 2017 the operating partnership guaranteed joint venture related mortgage indebtedness of 2116 million of which we have a right of recovery from our joint venture partners of 108 million a default by a joint venture under its debt obligations would expose us to liability under a guaranty we may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests advances or partner loans although such fundings are not typically required contractually or otherwise 

risks relating to environmental matters 

as owners of real estate we can face liabilities for environmental contamination 

us federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require us as a current or previous owner or operator of real property to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at a property or at impacted neighboring properties these laws often impose liability regardless of whether the property owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances these laws and regulations may require the abatement or removal of asbestos containing materials in the event of damage demolition or renovation reconstruction or expansion of a property and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air those laws and regulations also govern the installation maintenance and removal of underground storage tanks used to store waste oils or other petroleum products many of our properties contain or at one time contained asbestos containing materials or underground storage tanks primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment we may be subject to regulatory action and may also be held liable to third parties for personal injury or property damage incurred by the parties in connection with any such laws and regulations or hazardous or toxic substances the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances and related liabilities may be substantial and could materially and adversely affect us the presence of hazardous or toxic 

 

substances or the failure to remediate the related contamination may also adversely affect our ability to sell lease or redevelop a property or to borrow money using a property as collateral 

our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful 

although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with us federal state and local environmental laws and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances this belief is based on limited testing nearly all of our properties have been subjected to phase i or similar environmental audits these environmental audits have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us however we cannot assure you that 









other factors affecting our business 

some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance 

we maintain insurance coverage with third‑party carriers who provide a portion of the coverage for specific layers of potential losses including commercial general liability fire flood extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties in the united states the initial portion of coverage not provided by third‑party carriers is either insured through our wholly‑owned captive insurance company or other financial arrangements controlled by us a third‑party carrier has in turn agreed to provide if required evidence of coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carrier’s policy a similar policy either written through our captive insurance company or other financial arrangements controlled by us also provides initial coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal windstorm locations 

there are some types of losses including lease and other contract claims which generally are not insured or are subject to large deductibles if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue it could generate but may remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligation related to the property 

we currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the united states on an “all risk” basis in the amount of up to 1 billion the current us federal laws which provide this coverage are expected to operate through 2020 however the us government could in the future terminate its reinsurance of terrorism which would increase the risk of uninsured losses for terrorist acts despite the existence of this insurance coverage any threatened or actual terrorist attacks where we operate could materially and adversely affect us 

we face risks associated with security breaches through cyber‑attacks cyber intrusions or otherwise as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology it networks and related systems 

we face risks associated with security breaches whether through cyber‑attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet malware computer viruses attachments to e‑mails persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day‑to‑day operations and in some cases may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging even the most well protected information networks systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed not to be detected and in fact may not be detected accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk 

 

a breach or significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our systems including our primary website could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers tenants and revenues generate third party claims result in the unintended andor unauthorized public disclosure or the misappropriation of proprietary personal identifying and confidential information and require us to incur significant expenses to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues and we may not be able to recover these expenses in whole or in any part from our service providers or responsible parties or their or our insurers 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain talented employees and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our business 

the success of our business depends in part on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees and our ability to attract retain and motivate talented employees could significantly impact our future performance competition for these individuals is intense and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive management team and other key employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on us 

provisions in simon’s charter and by‑laws and in the operating partnership’s partnership agreement could prevent a change of control

we face possible risks associated with climate change 

we cannot determine with certainty whether global warming or cooling is occurring and if so at what rate to the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns our properties in certain markets could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea‑levels over time these conditions could result in volatile or decreased demand for retail space at certain of our properties or in extreme cases our inability to operate the properties at all climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of or making unavailable insurance on favorable terms or at all and increasing the cost of energy and snow removal at our properties moreover compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change including compliance with “green” building codes may require us to make improvements to our existing properties or increase taxes and fees assessed on us or our properties at this time there can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on us 

the united kingdom’s pending departure from the european union could have a material adverse effect on us 

following a national referendum in june 2016 the united kingdom formally notified the european council on march 29 2017 of its intention to withdraw from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” negotiations have commenced to determine the future terms of the united kingdom’s relationship with the eu including among other things the terms of trade between the united kingdom and the eu however the terms of any agreement governing the future relationship between the united kingdom and the eu as well as the legal and economic consequences of those terms remain unclear this continues to create political and economic uncertainty which has affected and may continue to affect market and macroeconomic conditions in both the united kingdom and eu economies in particular prolonged uncertainty 

 

during brexit negotiations may contribute to ongoing volatility in financial and foreign exchange markets in the united kingdom and eu including a fall in gross domestic product and volatility in the value of pounds sterling 

brexit could also contribute to greater volatility in global financial and foreign exchange markets after the terms of the united kingdom’s future relationships with the eu are settled further financial and other markets may suffer losses as a result of any other countries determining to withdraw from the eu or from any future significant changes to the eu’s structure andor regulations 

we currently hold and may acquire additional equity interests in properties located in the united kingdom and europe as well as other investments that are denominated in pounds sterling and euro in addition our operating partnership has issued and may issue in the future senior unsecured notes denominated in euro any of the effects of brexit described above and others we cannot anticipate could have a material adverse effect on us including the value of our properties and investments and our potential growth in europe and could amplify the currency risks faced by us

we generate the majority of our revenues from leases with retail dining entertainment and other tenants including 







revenues of our management company after intercompany eliminations consist primarily of management fees that are typically based upon the revenues of the property being managed 

we invest in real estate properties to maximize total financial return which includes both operating cash flows and capital appreciation we seek growth in earnings funds from operations or ffo and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments we seek to accomplish this growth through the following 











we also grow by generating supplemental revenues from the following activities 



 









we focus on high quality real estate across the retail real estate spectrum we expand or redevelop properties to enhance profitability and market share of existing assets when we believe the investment of our capital meets our risk‑reward criteria we selectively develop new properties in markets we believe are not adequately served by existing retail outlet properties 

we routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio our international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk 

to support our growth we employ a three‑fold capital strategy 







we consider ffo net operating income or noi portfolio noi and comparable property noi noi for properties owned and operated in both periods under comparison to be key measures of operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or gaap we use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure are included below in this discussion 

results overview 

diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per unit increased 037 during 2017 to 624 as compared to 587 in 2016 the increase in diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per unit was primarily attributable to 

















solid core business fundamentals during 2017 were primarily driven by strong leasing activity portfolio noi grew by 45 in 2017 as compared to 2016 comparable property noi grew 32 for our portfolio of us malls premium outlets and the mills total sales per square foot or psf increased to 628 psf at december 31 2017 from 614 psf at 

 

december 31 2016 for our us malls and premium outlets average base minimum rent for us malls and premium outlets increased 29 to 5311 psf as of december 31 2017 from 5159 psf as of december 31 2016 leasing spreads in our us malls and premium outlets were positive as we were able to lease available square feet at higher rents resulting in an openclose leasing spread based on total tenant payments — base minimum rent plus common area maintenance of 742 psf 7268 openings compared to 6526 closings as of december 31 2017 representing an 114 increase ending occupancy for our us malls and premium outlets decreased 12 to 956 as of december 31 2017 from 968 as of december 31 2016 

our effective overall borrowing rate at december 31 2017 on our consolidated indebtedness decreased 14 basis points to 325 as compared to 339 at december 31 2016 this reduction was primarily due to a decrease in the effective overall borrowing rate on fixed rate debt of 16 basis points 330 at december 31 2017 as compared to 346 at december 31 2016 partially offset by an increase in the effective overall borrowing rate on variable rate debt of 45 basis points 219 at december 31 2017 as compared to 174 at december 31 2016 at december 31 2017 the weighted average years to maturity of our consolidated indebtedness was 70 years as compared to 74 years at december 31 2016 

our financing activity for the year ended december 31 2017 and material subsequent events included 















united states portfolio data 

the portfolio data discussed in this overview includes the following key operating statistics ending occupancy average base minimum rent per square foot and total sales per square foot for our domestic assets we include acquired properties in this data beginning in the year of acquisition and remove disposed properties in the year of disposition for comparative information purposes we separate the information related to the mills from our other us operations we also do not include any information for properties located outside the united states 

 

the following table sets forth these key operating statistics for 











ending occupancy levels and average base minimum rent per square foot ending occupancy is the percentage of gross leasable area or gla which is leased as of the last day of the reporting period we include all company owned space except for mall anchors mall majors mall freestanding and mall outlots in the calculation base minimum rent per square foot is the average base minimum rent charge in effect for the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in ending occupancy 

total sales per square foot total sales include total reported retail tenant sales on a trailing 12‑month basis at owned gla for mall stores with less than 10000 square feet in the malls and the mills and stores with less than 20000 square feet in the premium outlets retail sales at owned gla affect revenue and profitability levels because sales determine the amount of minimum rent that can be charged the percentage rent realized and the recoverable expenses common area maintenance real estate taxes etc that tenants can afford to pay 

current leasing activities 

during 2017 we signed 849 new leases and 1302 renewal leases excluding mall anchors and majors new development redevelopment and leases with terms of one year or less with a fixed minimum rent across our us malls and premium outlets portfolio comprising approximately 67 million square feet of which 50 million square feet related to consolidated properties during 2016 we signed 960 new leases and 1270 renewal leases with a fixed minimum rent comprising approximately 73 million square feet of which 54 million square feet related to consolidated properties the average annual initial base minimum rent for new leases was 5945 per square foot in 2016 and 5860 per square foot in 2017 with an average tenant allowance on new leases of 3929 per square foot and 5053 per square foot respectively

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

other expenses increased 141 million primarily due to the write off of predevelopment costs of 315 million related to the copley residential tower project that we are no longer pursuing partially offset by a decrease in legal fees and expenses and a more favorable net foreign currency revaluation impact on foreign currency‑denominated assets and liabilities during 2015 

interest expense decreased 661 million primarily due to the net impact of our financing activities during 2016 and 2015 and the reduction in our effective overall borrowing rate 

 

during 2016 we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of 1368 million as a result of an early redemption of senior unsecured notes during 2015 we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of 1210 million as a result of an early redemption of senior unsecured notes 

income and other taxes increased 95 million as a result of taxes due on the sale of one of the multifamily residential investments and taxes related to certain of our international investments 

income from unconsolidated entities increased 685 million primarily due to favorable results of operations and financing activity of joint venture properties as well as our acquisition and development activity 

during 2016 we recorded a gain related to klépierre’s sale of certain assets our sale of three consolidated retail properties and disposition of our interests in four unconsolidated retail properties the aggregate gain on the transactions was 432 million we also recorded a noncash remeasurement gain of 414 million related to the change in control of our interest in the european outlet properties as further discussed in note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements during 2015 we disposed of our interests in three unconsolidated retail properties resulting in a gain of 436 million and we recorded a non‑cash gain on klépierre’s acquisition of corio of 2069 million as discussed in note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

simon’s net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased 158 million primarily due to a decrease in the net income of the operating partnership 

liquidity and capital resources 

because we own long‑lived income‑producing assets our financing strategy relies primarily on long‑term fixed rate debt floating rate debt comprised only 46 of our total consolidated debt at december 31 2017 we also enter into interest rate protection agreements to manage our interest rate risk we derive most of our liquidity from positive net cash flow from operations and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities that totaled 40 billion in the aggregate during 2017 the operating partnership has a 40 billion unsecured revolving credit facility or credit facility the operating partnership also has a 35 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility or supplemental facility and together with the credit facility the credit facilities the credit facilities and the commercial paper program provide alternative sources of liquidity as our cash needs vary from time to time borrowing capacity under these sources may be increased as discussed further below 

our balance of cash and cash equivalents increased 9223 million during 2017 to 15 billion as of december 31 2017 as further discussed in “cash flows” below 

on december 31 2017 we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of approximately 62 billion under the credit facilities net of outstanding borrowings of 3226 million amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program of 9785 million and letters of credit of 209 million for the year ended december 31 2017 the maximum aggregate outstanding balance under the credit facilities was 9609 million and the weighted average outstanding balance was 4555 million the weighted average interest rate was 131 for the year ended december 31 2017 

simon has historically had access to public equity markets and the operating partnership has historically had access to private and public longterm and shortterm unsecured debt markets and access to secured debt and private equity from institutional investors at the property level 

our business model and simon’s status as a reit require us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition development and redevelopment activity and to refinance maturing debt simon may also from time to time access the equity capital markets to accomplish our business objectives we believe we have sufficient cash on hand and availability under the credit facilities and the commercial paper program to address our debt maturities and capital needs through 2018 

cash flows 

our net cash flow from operating activities and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities totaled 40 billion during 2017 in addition we had net proceeds from our debt financing and repayment activities including the 1286 million debt extinguishment charge of 11 billion in 2017 these activities are further discussed below under “financing and debt” during 2017 we also 



 













in general we anticipate that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating expenses monthly debt service recurring capital expenditures and dividends to stockholders andor distributions to partners necessary to maintain simon’s reit qualification on a long‑term basis in addition we expect to be able to generate or obtain capital for nonrecurring capital expenditures such as acquisitions major building redevelopments and expansions as well as for scheduled principal maturities on outstanding indebtedness from 









we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2018 and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash these cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our tenants a significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds from the credit facilities and commercial paper program curtail planned capital expenditures or seek other additional sources of financing as discussed above 

financing and debt 

unsecured debt 

at december 31 2017 our unsecured debt consisted of 165 billion of senior unsecured notes of the operating partnership 3226 million outstanding under the operating partnership’s supplemental facility and 9785 million outstanding under the operating partnership’s commercial paper program the december 31 2017 balance on the supplemental facility included 1976 million us dollar equivalent of yendenominated borrowings foreign currency denominated borrowings under the supplemental facility are designated as net investment hedges of a portion of our international investments

mortgage debt 

total mortgage indebtedness was 69 billion and 65 billion at december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively 

on april 21 2017 as discussed in note 7 through our european investee we acquired rosada designer outlet in roosendaal netherlands subject to an existing euriborbased variable rate mortgage loan of 401 million us dollar equivalent 

covenants 

our unsecured debt agreements contain financial covenants and other non‑financial covenants if we were to fail to comply with these covenants after the expiration of the applicable cure periods the debt maturity could be accelerated or other remedies could be sought by the lender including adjustments to the applicable interest rate as of december 31 2017 we were in compliance with all covenants of our unsecured debt 

at december 31 2017 we or our subsidiaries were the borrowers under 47 non‑recourse mortgage notes secured by mortgages on 50 properties including two separate pools of cross‑defaulted and cross‑collateralized mortgages encumbering a total of five properties under these cross‑default provisions a default under any mortgage included in the cross‑defaulted pool may constitute a default under all mortgages within that pool and may lead to acceleration of the indebtedness due on each property within the pool certain of our secured debt instruments contain financial and other non‑financial covenants which are specific to the properties that serve as collateral for that debt if the applicable borrower under these nonrecourse mortgage notes were to fail to comply with these covenants the lender could accelerate the debt and enforce its rights against their collateral at december 31 2017 the applicable borrowers under these non‑recourse 

 

mortgage notes were in compliance with all covenants where non‑compliance could individually or in the aggregate giving effect to applicable cross‑default provisions have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity or results of operations 

summary of financing 

our consolidated debt adjusted to reflect outstanding derivative instruments and the effective weighted average interest rates as of december 31 2017 and 2016 consisted of the following dollars in thousands 





contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

in regards to long‑term debt arrangements the following table summarizes the material aspects of these future obligations on our consolidated indebtedness as of december 31 2017 and subsequent years thereafter dollars in thousands assuming the obligations remain outstanding through initial maturities including applicable exercise of available extension options 













our off‑balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of our investments in joint ventures which are common in the real estate industry and are described in note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements our joint ventures typically fund their cash needs through secured debt financings obtained by and in the name of the joint venture entity the joint venture debt is secured by a first mortgage is without recourse to the joint venture partners and does not represent a liability of the partners except to the extent the partners or their affiliates expressly guarantee the joint venture debt as of december 31 2017 the operating partnership guaranteed joint venture related mortgage indebtedness of 2116 million of which we have a right of recovery from our venture partners of 108 million mortgages guaranteed by the operating partnership are secured by the property of the joint venture which could be sold in order to satisfy the outstanding obligation and which has an estimated fair value in excess of the guaranteed amount we may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests advances or partner loans although such fundings are not required contractually or otherwise 

 

hurricane impacts 

as discussed further in note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements during the third quarter of 2017 certain of our properties experienced property damage and business interruption due to hurricanerelated impacts in texas florida and puerto rico 

acquisitions and dispositions 

buy‑sell marketing rights and other exit mechanisms are common in real estate partnership agreements most of our partners are institutional investors who have a history of direct investment in retail real estate we and our partners in our joint venture properties may initiate these provisions subject to any applicable lock up or similar restrictions if we determine it is in our stockholders’ best interests for us to purchase the joint venture interest and we believe we have adequate liquidity to execute the purchase without hindering our cash flows then we may initiate these provisions or elect to buy our partner’s interest if we decide to sell any of our joint venture interests we expect to use the net proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness or to reinvest in development redevelopment or expansion opportunities 

acquisitions in february 2016 we and our partner through our european investee acquired a noncontrolling 75 ownership interest in an outlet center in ochtrup germany for cash consideration of approximately 383 million on july 25 2016 this european investee also acquired the remaining 33 interest in two italian outlet centers in naples and venice as well as the remaining interests in related expansion projects and working capital for cash consideration of approximately 1597 million this resulted in the consolidation of these two properties on the acquisition date requiring a remeasurement of our previously held equity interest to fair value and the recognition of a noncash gain of 293 million in earnings during the third quarter of 2016 

on april 21 2017 this european investee acquired a 100 interest in an outlet center in roosendaal netherlands for cash consideration of 698 million and the assumption of existing mortgage debt of 401 million in may 2017 the assumed loan was refinanced with a 690 million mortgage due in 2024 after available extension options with an interest rate of euribor plus 185 

on april 14 2016 we and our joint venture partner completed the acquisition of the shops at crystals a 262000 square foot luxury shopping center on the las vegas strip for 11 billion the transaction was funded with a combination of cash on hand cash from our partner and a 5500 million 374 fixedrate mortgage financing that will mature on july 1 2026 we have a 50 noncontrolling interest in this joint venture and manage the daytoday operations 

dispositions we may continue to pursue the disposition of properties that no longer meet our strategic criteria or that are not a primary retail venue within their trade area 

during 2017 we disposed of our interests in one unconsolidated retail property the loss recognized on this transaction was approximately 13 million as discussed in note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements klépierre disposed of its interests in certain shopping centers resulting in a gain of which our share was 50 million 

during 2016 we disposed of our interests in two unconsolidated multifamily residential investments three consolidated retail properties and four unconsolidated retail properties our share of the gross proceeds from these transactions was 818 million the gain on the consolidated retail properties was 124 million the gain on the unconsolidated retail properties was 226 million the aggregate gain of 362 million from the sale of the two unconsolidated multifamily residential investments is included in other income and resulted in an additional 72 million in taxes included in income and other taxes as discussed in note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements klépierre disposed of its interest in certain scandinavian properties during the fourth quarter resulting in a gain of which our share was 81 million 

joint venture formation activity 

on september 15 2016 we and our partners through two separate joint ventures acquired certain assets and liabilities of aéropostale a retailer of apparel and accessories out of bankruptcy our noncontrolling interest in the retail operations venture and in the licensing venture is 4905 and 2845 respectively our aggregate investment in these ventures was 331 million which includes our share of working capital funded into the retail business 

on july 22 2015 we closed on our joint venture with hbc to which hbc contributed 42 properties in the us and we committed to contribute 1000 million for improvements to the properties contributed by hbc in exchange for a noncontrolling equity interest in hbs as of december 31 2017 we have funded 683 million of this commitment on 

 

september 30 2015 hbc announced it had closed on the acquisition of galeria holding the parent company of germany’s leading department store kaufhof in conjunction with the closing hbs acquired 41 kaufhof properties in germany from hbc all of these properties have been leased to affiliates of hbc we contributed an additional 1785 million to hbs upon closing of the galeria holding transaction our noncontrolling equity interest in hbs is approximately 117 at december 31 2017 

on april 13 2015 we announced a joint venture with sears holdings or sears whereby sears contributed 10 of its properties located at our malls to the joint venture in exchange for a 50 noncontrolling interest in the joint venture sears or its affiliates leased back each of the 10 properties from the joint venture seritage growth properties or seritage a public reit formed by sears now holds sears’ original 50 noncontrolling interest in the joint venture we contributed 1140 million in cash in exchange for a 50 noncontrolling interest in the joint venture the joint venture has the right to recapture not less than 50 of the space leased to sears to be used for purposes of redeveloping and releasing the recaptured space 

on november 3 2017 we acquired additional interests in the real estate assets andor rights to terminate leases related to twelve sears stores located at our malls including five stores previously held in our joint venture with seritage in order to redevelop these properties the total cost of this transaction was 1846 million which is reflected as investment property four of the sears stores are at properties held in unconsolidated joint ventures and should our partners participate in the transaction and related redevelopment the cost of the transaction to us will be reduced by their proportionate share our joint venture with seritage now covers the former sears properties located at five of our malls 

development activity 

we routinely incur costs related to construction for significant redevelopment and expansion projects at our properties redevelopment and expansion projects including the addition of anchors big box tenants and restaurants are underway at 25 properties in the united states and canada 

our share of the costs of all new development redevelopment and expansion projects currently under construction is approximately 07 billion we expect to fund these capital projects with cash flows from operations our estimated stabilized return on invested capital typically ranges between 710 for all our new development redevelopment and expansion projects 

summary of capital expenditures the following table summarizes total capital expenditures on consolidated properties on a cash basis in millions 



  

new domestic developments redevelopments and expansions 

during 2017 the following properties opened 





during the second quarter of 2017 construction began on denver premium outlets a 328000 square foot project in thornton denver colorado projected to open in september 2018 we own a 100 interest in this project the estimated cost of this project is 1206 million 

 

  

international development activity 

we typically reinvest net cash flow from our international joint ventures to fund future international development activity we believe this strategy mitigates some of the risk of our initial investment and our exposure to changes in foreign currencies we have also funded most of our foreign investments with local currency‑denominated borrowings that act as a natural hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates our consolidated net income exposure to changes in the volatility of the euro yen won and other foreign currencies is not material we expect our share of international development costs for 2018 will be approximately 251 million primarily funded through reinvested joint venture cash flow and construction loans 

the following table describes these recently completed new development and expansion projects as well as our share of the estimated total cost as of december 31 2017 in millions 



  

dividends distributions and stock repurchase program 

simon paid a common stock dividend of 185 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 715 per share for the year ended december 31 2017 the operating partnership paid distributions per unit for the same amounts in 2016 simon paid dividends of 165 and 650 per share for the three and twelve month periods ended december 31 2016 respectively the operating partnership paid distributions per unit for the same amounts simon’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend for the first quarter of 2018 of 195 per share of common stock payable on february 28 2018 to stockholders of record on february 14 2018 the distribution rate on units is equal to the dividend rate on common stock in order to maintain its status as a reit simon must pay a minimum amount of dividends simon’s future dividends and the operating partnership’s future distributions will be determined by simon’s board of directors in its sole discretion based on actual and projected financial condition liquidity and results of operations cash available for dividends and limited partner distributions cash reserves as deemed necessary for capital and operating expenditures financing covenants if any and the amount required to maintain simon’s status as a reit 

on april 2 2015 simon’s board of directors authorized simon to repurchase up to 20 billion of common stock over a twentyfour month period as market conditions warrant and on february 13 2017 simon’s board of directors authorized a twoyear extension of the program through march 31 2019 simon may repurchase the shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as market conditions warrant during the year ended december 31 2017 simon repurchased 2468630 shares at an average price of 16487 per share of its common stock as part of this program

forward‑looking statements 

certain statements made in this section or elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k may be deemed forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 although we believe the expectations reflected in any forwardlooking statements are based on reasonable assumptions we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained and it is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forwardlooking statements due to a variety of risks uncertainties and other factors such factors include but are not limited to changes in economic and market conditions that adversely affect the general retail environment the potential loss of anchor stores or major tenants the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise decreases in market rental rates the intensely competitive market environment in the retail industry the inability to lease newly developed properties and renew leases and relet space at existing properties on favorable terms risks related to international activities including without limitation the impact of brexit changes to applicable laws or regulations or the interpretation thereof risks associated with the acquisition development redevelopment expansion leasing and management of properties general risks related to real estate investments including the illiquidity of real estate investments the impact of our substantial indebtedness on our future operations any disruption in the financial markets that adversely affects our ability to access capital for growth and satisfy our ongoing debt service requirements any change in our credit rating changes in market rates of interest and foreign exchange rates for foreign currencies changes in the value of our investments in foreign entities our ability to hedge interest rate and currency risk our continued ability to maintain our status as a reit changes in tax laws or regulations that result in adverse tax consequences risks relating to our joint venture properties environmental liabilities changes in insurance costs the availability of comprehensive insurance coverage security breaches that could compromise our information technology or infrastructure natural disasters the potential for terrorist activities and the loss of key management personnel we discussed these and other risks and uncertainties under the heading risk factors in part i item1a of this annual report on form 10k we may update that discussion in subsequent other periodic reports but except as required by law we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise these forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise 

non‑gaap financial measures 

industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties in part based on performance measures such as ffo diluted ffo per share noi portfolio noi and comparable property noi we believe that these non‑gaap measures are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of reits and provide a relevant basis for comparison among reits we also use these measures internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio 

we determine ffo based on the definition set forth by the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit as consolidated net income computed in accordance with gaap 













we have adopted nareit’s clarification of the definition of ffo that requires us to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary cumulative effect of accounting changes or a gain or loss resulting from the sale of or any impairment charges related to previously depreciated retail operating properties 

 

we include in ffo gains and losses realized from the sale of land outlot buildings marketable and non‑marketable securities and investment holdings of non‑retail real estate we also include in ffo the impact of foreign currency exchange gains and losses legal expenses transaction expenses and other items required by gaap 

you should understand that our computations of these non‑gaap measures might not be comparable to similar measures reported by other reits and that these non‑gaap measures 







 

the following schedule reconciles total ffo to consolidated net income and for simon diluted net income per share to diluted ffo per share 









  

 

the following schedule reconciles consolidated net income to noi and sets forth the computations of portfolio noi and comparable property noi 











  

 

item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our long‑term debt obligations we manage exposure to interest rate market risk through our risk management strategy by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of variable rate debt we are also exposed to foreign currency risk on financings of certain foreign operations our intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging these exposures we do not enter into either interest rate protection or foreign currency rate protection agreements for speculative purposes 

we may enter into treasury lock agreements as part of anticipated issuances of senior notes upon completion of the debt issuance the cost of these instruments is recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt agreement 

our future earnings cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest primarily libor based upon consolidated indebtedness and interest rates at december 31 2017 a 50 basis point increase in the market rates of interest would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 61 million and would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately 6964 million

other policies 

the following is a discussion of our investment policies financing policies conflict of interest policies and policies with respect to certain other activities one or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote 

investment policies 

while we emphasize equity real estate investments we may also provide secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers consistent with simon’s qualification as a reit however any of these investments would be subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for reit qualification these reit limitations mean that simon cannot make an investment that would cause its real estate assets to be less than 75 of its total assets simon must also derive at least 75 of its gross income directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including “rents from real property” dividends from other reits and in certain circumstances interest from certain types of temporary investments in addition simon must also derive at least 95 of its gross income from such real property investments and from dividends interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing 

subject to simon’s reit limitations we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate such an investment would normally be in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties we may in the future acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies 

 

financing policies 

because simon’s reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of its reit taxable income we regularly access the debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions develop and redevelop properties and refinance maturing debt we must comply with the covenants contained in our financing agreements that limit our ratio of debt to total assets or market value as defined for example the operating partnership’s lines of credit and the indentures for the operating partnership’s debt securities contain covenants that restrict the total amount of debt of the operating partnership to 65 or 60 in relation to certain debt of total assets as defined under the related agreements and secured debt to 50 of total assets in addition these agreements contain other covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios furthermore the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for the debt securities of the operating partnership we strive to maintain investment grade ratings at all times for various business reasons including their effect on our ability to access attractive capital but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so in the future 

if simon’s board of directors determines to seek additional capital we may raise such capital by offering equity or incurring debt creating joint ventures with existing ownership interests in properties entering into joint venture arrangements for new development projects retaining cash flows or a combination of these methods if simon’s board of directors determines to raise equity capital it may without stockholder approval issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock simon’s board of directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital or may issue units in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate we may also raise additional capital by issuing common units of partnership interest in the operating partnership or units such securities also may include additional classes of simon’s preferred stock or preferred units of partnership interest in the operating partnership or preferred units which may be convertible into common stock or units as the case may be existing stockholders and unitholders have no preemptive right to purchase shares or units in any subsequent issuances of securities by us any issuance of equity could dilute a stockholder’s investment in simon or a limited partner’s investment in the operating partnership 

we expect most future borrowings will be made through the operating partnership or its subsidiaries we might however incur borrowings through other entities that would be reloaned to the operating partnership borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings publicly and privately placed debt instruments or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties any such indebtedness may be secured or unsecured any such indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to the borrower or be cross‑collateralized with other debt or may be fully or partially guaranteed by the operating partnership we issue unsecured debt securities through the operating partnership but we may issue other debt securities which may be convertible into common or preferred stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase common or preferred stock we also may sell or securitize our lease receivables although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends we currently have no expectation that we will regularly do so 

the operating partnership has a 40 billion unsecured revolving credit facility or credit facility the credit facility’s initial borrowing capacity of 40 billion may be increased to 50 billion during its term the initial maturity date of the credit facility is june 30 2018 and can be extended for an additional year to june 30 2019 at our sole option subject to our continued compliance with the terms thereof the operating partnership also has a 350 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility or supplemental facility and together with the credit facility the credit facilities on april 6 2016 the operating partnership amended the supplemental facility to among other matters i exercise its 7500 million accordion feature such that the supplemental facility’s borrowing capacity was increased from 275 billion to 350 billion and ii add a new 7500 million accordion feature to permit us to further increase the supplemental facility’s borrowing capacity to 425 billion during its term the initial maturity date of the supplemental facility is june 30 2019 and can be extended for an additional year to june 30 2020 at our sole option subject to our continued compliance with the terms thereof the base interest rate on each of the credit facility and the supplemental facility is libor plus 80 basis points with an additional facility fee of 10 basis points the credit facilities provide for borrowings denominated in us dollars euros yen sterling canadian dollars and australian dollars 

the operating partnership also has available a global unsecured commercial paper note program or the commercial paper program of 10 billion or the non‑us dollar equivalent thereof the operating partnership may issue unsecured commercial paper notes denominated in us dollars euros and other currencies notes issued in non‑us currencies may be issued by one or more subsidiaries of the operating partnership and are guaranteed by the operating partnership these notes are sold under customary terms in the us and euro commercial paper note markets and rank either by themselves or as a result of the guarantee described above pari passu with the operating partnership’s other unsecured senior indebtedness the commercial paper program is supported by the credit facilities and if necessary or 

 

appropriate we may make one or more draws under either credit facility to pay amounts outstanding from time to time on the commercial paper program 

we may also finance our business through the following 















the operating partnership may also issue units to contributors of properties or other partnership interests which may permit the contributor to defer tax gain recognition under the internal revenue code 

we do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property mortgage financing instruments however typically limit additional indebtedness on such properties additionally the credit facilities our unsecured note indentures and other contracts may limit our ability to borrow and contain limits on mortgage indebtedness we may incur as well as certain financial covenants we must maintain 

typically we invest in or form special purpose entities to assist us in obtaining secured permanent financing at attractive terms permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage loan on a single property or on a group of properties and generally requires us to provide a mortgage lien on the property or properties in favor of an institutional third party as a joint venture with a third party or as a securitized financing for securitized financings we create special purpose entities to own the properties these special purpose entities which are common in the real estate industry are structured so that they would not be consolidated in a bankruptcy proceeding involving a parent company we decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives for accounting purposes we include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness 

conflict of interest policies 

we maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest simon has adopted governance principles governing the function conduct selection orientation and duties of its subsidiaries and simon’s board of directors and the company as well as written charters for each of the standing committees of simon’s board of directors in addition simon’s board of directors has a code of business conduct and ethics which applies to all of its officers directors and employees and those of its subsidiaries at least a majority of the members of simon’s board of directors must qualify as independent under the listing standards of the new york stock exchange or nyse and cannot be affiliated with the simon family who are significant stockholders andor unitholders in the operating partnership in addition the audit and compensation committees of simon’s board of directors are comprised entirely of independent members who meet the additional independence and financial sophistication requirements of the nyse any transaction between us and the simon family including property acquisitions service and property management agreements and retail space leases must be approved by a majority of simon’s nonaffiliated directors 

the sale by the operating partnership of any property that it owns may have an adverse tax impact on the simon family or other limited partners of the operating partnership in order to avoid any conflict of interest the simon charter requires that at least threefourths of simon’s independent directors must authorize and require the operating partnership to sell any property it owns any such sale is subject to applicable agreements with third parties noncompetition agreements executed by david simon simon’s chairman and chief executive officer and herbert simon simon’s chairman emeritus as well as david simons employment agreement contain covenants limiting their ability to participate in certain shopping center activities 

 

policies with respect to certain other activities 

we intend to make investments which are consistent with simon’s qualification as a reit unless simon’s board of directors determines that it is no longer in simon’s best interests to so qualify as a reit simon’s board of directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the reit requirements simon has authority to issue shares of its capital stock or other securities in exchange for property we also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares our units or any other securities on april 2 2015 simon’s board of directors authorized simon to repurchase up to 20 billion of its common stock over a twenty‑four month period as market conditions warrant or the repurchase program under the repurchase program simon may repurchase the shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at december 31 2016 we had remaining authority to repurchase 14 billion of common stock and on february 13 2017 simon’s board of directors authorized a twoyear extension of the repurchase program through march 31 2019 simon may also issue shares of its common stock or pay cash at its option to holders of units in future periods upon exercise of such holders’ rights under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership our policy prohibits us from making any loans to the directors or executive officers of simon for any purpose we may make loans to the joint ventures in which we participate additionally we may make or buy interests in loans secured by real estate properties owned by others or make investments in companies that own real estate assets 

competition 

the retail real estate industry is dynamic and competitive we compete with numerous merchandise distribution channels including malls outlet centers communitylifestyle centers and other shopping centers in the united states and abroad we also compete with internet retailing sites and catalogs which provide retailers with distribution options beyond existing brick and mortar retail properties the existence of competitive alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we can obtain this results in competition for both the tenants to occupy the properties that we develop and manage as well as for the acquisition of prime sites including land for development and operating properties we believe that there are numerous factors that make our properties highly desirable to retailers including

 item 1a risk factors 

the following factors among others could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward‑looking statements made in this annual report on form 10‑k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations funds from operations or ffo and prospects which we refer to herein as a material adverse effect on us or as materially and adversely affecting us and you should carefully consider them additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which are currently not believed to be material may also affect our actual results we may update these factors in our future periodic reports 

risks relating to retail operations 

overall economic and market conditions may adversely affect the general retail environment 

our concentration in the retail real estate market means that we are subject to a number of factors that could adversely affect the retail environment generally including without limitation 























we derive our operating results primarily from retail tenants many of whom have been and continue to be under some degree of economic stress a significant deterioration in the creditworthiness of our retail tenants could have a material adverse effect on us 

some of our properties depend on anchor stores or other major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more of these anchor stores or major tenants 

our properties are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally recognized tenants the value of some of our properties could be materially and adversely affected if these anchors or other major tenants fail to comply with their contractual obligations or cease their operations 

for example among department stores and other large stores — often referred to as “big box” stores — corporate merger activity typically results in the closure of duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations further sustained adverse pressure on the results of our department stores and major tenants may have a similarly sustained adverse impact upon our own results certain department stores and other national retailers have experienced and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future given current macroeconomic uncertainty and less‑than‑desirable levels of consumer confidence considerable decreases in customer traffic in their retail stores increased competition from alternative retail options such as those accessible via the internet and other forms of pressure on their business models as pressure on these department stores and national retailers increases their ability to maintain their stores meet their obligations both to us and to their external lenders and suppliers withstand takeover attempts by investors or rivals or avoid bankruptcy andor liquidation may be impaired and result in closures of their stores or their seeking of a lease modification with us any lease modification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and could decrease rents or expense recovery charges other tenants 

 

may be entitled to modify the economic or other terms of or terminate their existing leases with us in the event of such closures 

if a department store or major tenant were to close its stores at our properties we may experience difficulty and delay and incur significant expense in replacing the tenant as well as in leasing spaces in areas adjacent to the vacant department store or major tenant at attractive rates or at all additionally department store or major tenant closures may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sales at our properties if the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to the closing of anchor stores or other national retailers adverse economic conditions or other reasons tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges in the event of any default by a tenant we may not be able to fully recover andor may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with such parties 

we face potential adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies 

bankruptcy filings by retailers can occur regularly in the course of our operations if a tenant files for bankruptcy the tenant may have the right to reject and terminate one or more of its leases with us and we cannot be sure that it will affirm one or more of its leases and continue to make rental payments to us in a timely manner a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants would bar all efforts by us to collect pre‑bankruptcy debts from that tenant or from their property unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court in addition we cannot evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy if a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy all pre‑bankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full however if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages in connection with such balances if a bankrupt tenant vacates a space it might not do so in a timely manner and we might be unable to re‑lease the vacated space during that time at attractive rates or at all furthermore we may be required to incur significant expense in replacing the bankrupt tenant any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims and there are restrictions under bankruptcy laws that limit the amount of the claim we can make if a lease is rejected as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold we continually seek to re‑lease vacant spaces resulting from tenant terminations the bankruptcy of a tenant particularly an anchor tenant or a national tenant with multiple locations may make the re‑leasing of their space difficult and costly and it also may be more difficult to lease the remainder of the space at the affected properties future tenant bankruptcies may impact our ability to successfully execute our re‑leasing strategy and could materially and adversely affect us 

we face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably 

our properties compete with other retail properties and other forms of retailing such as catalogs and e‑commerce websites competition may come from malls outlet centers communitylifestyle centers and other shopping centers both existing as well as future development and redevelopmentexpansion projects as well as catalogs and e‑commerce the presence of competitive alternatives affects our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain new construction renovations and expansions at competing sites could also negatively affect our properties 

we also compete with other major real estate investors and developers for attractive investment opportunities and prime development sites competition for the acquisition of existing properties and development sites may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect our ability to make attractive investments on favorable terms or at all in addition we compete with other retail property companies for tenants and qualified management 

we may not be able to lease newly developed properties and renew leases and relet space at existing properties 

we may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants also when leases for our existing properties expire the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms to the extent that our leasing goals are not achieved we could be materially and adversely affected 

  

 

risks relating to real estate investments and operations 

our international activities may subject us to different or greater risk from those associated with our domestic operations 

as of december 31 2016 we held interests in consolidated and joint venture properties that operate in austria italy germany japan malaysia mexico the netherlands south korea canada and the united kingdom we also have an equity stake in klépierre a publicly‑traded european real estate company which operates in 16 countries in europe accordingly our operating results and the value of our international operations may be impacted by any unhedged movements in the foreign currencies in which those operations transact and in which our net investment in the international operation is held we may pursue additional investment development and redevelopmentexpansion opportunities outside the united states international investment ownership development and redevelopmentexpansion activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our domestic properties and operations these risks include but are not limited to 



















our international activities represented approximately 61 of consolidated net income and 84 of our net operating income or noi for the year ended december 31 2016 to the extent that we expand our international activities the above risks could increase in significance which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us 

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations that could adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability 

our properties are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to varying judicial or regulatory interpretations these laws and regulations may include zoning laws building codes competition laws rules and agreements landlordtenant laws property tax regulations changes in real estate assessments and other laws and regulations generally applicable to business operations noncompliance with such laws and regulations and any associated litigation could expose us to liability 

we face risks associated with the acquisition development redevelopment and expansion of properties 

we regularly acquire and develop new properties and redevelop and expand existing properties and these activities are subject to various risks we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition development or redevelopmentexpansion opportunities in addition newly acquired developed or redevelopedexpanded properties may not perform as well as expected impacting our anticipated return on investment we are subject to other risks in connection with any acquisition development and redevelopmentexpansion activities including the following 









 





if a development or redevelopmentexpansion project is unsuccessful either because it is not meeting our expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project planning we could lose our investment in the project further if we guarantee the property’s financing our loss could exceed our investment in the project 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid 

our properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets these investments are relatively illiquid as a result our ability to sell one or more of our properties or investments in real estate in response to any changes in economic industry or other conditions may be limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability and terms of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand for space that are beyond our control if we want to sell a property we cannot assure you that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or at all or that the sales price of a property will be attractive at the relevant time or even exceed the carrying value of our investment moreover if a property is mortgaged we may not be able to obtain a release of the lien on that property without the payment of the associated debt andor a substantial prepayment penalty which could restrict our ability to dispose of the property even though the sale might otherwise be desirable 

risks relating to debt and the financial markets 

we have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations 

as of december 31 2016 our consolidated mortgages and unsecured indebtedness excluding related premium discount and debt issuance costs totaled 231 billion as a result of this indebtedness we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows for debt service including selected repayment at scheduled maturities which limits our ability to use those cash flows to fund the growth of our business we are also subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flows from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service or that we will be able to refinance such indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the applicable property such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants cause a reduction in the income from the property our indebtedness could also have other adverse consequences on us including reducing our access to capital or increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic industry and market conditions in addition if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value if any of the foregoing occurs we could be materially and adversely affected 

disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements 

we depend on external financings principally debt financings to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt our access to financing depends on the willingness of lending institutions and other debt investors to grant credit to us and conditions in the capital markets in general an economic recession may cause extreme volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets we rely upon the credit facilities as sources of funding for numerous transactions our access to these funds is dependent upon the ability of each of the participants to the credit facilities to meet their funding commitments to us when markets are volatile access to capital and credit markets could be disrupted over an extended period of time and one or more financial institutions may not have the available capital to meet their previous commitments to us the failure of one or more participants to the credit facilities to meet their funding commitments to us could have a material adverse effect on us including as a result of making it difficult to obtain the financing we may need for future growth andor meeting our debt service requirements we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for the future growth of our business or to meet our debt service requirements or that a sufficient amount of financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 

adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

the operating partnership’s outstanding senior unsecured notes credit facilities the commercial paper program and simon’s preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios financial condition and prospects and other factors 

 

viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and the economic outlook in general our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund the growth of our business an adverse change in our credit rating including actual changes and changes in outlook or even the initiation of a review of our credit rating that could result in an adverse change could have a material adverse effect on us 

the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that might affect our ability to operate freely 

we have a variety of unsecured debt including the credit facilities and secured property‑level debt certain of the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain covenants including among other things limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured indebtedness sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and certain acquisitions in addition certain of the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain financial covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios including certain coverage ratios these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous to us in addition our ability to comply with these provisions might be affected by events beyond our control failure to comply with any of our financing covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate the related indebtedness as well as other of our indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on us 

our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk 

we selectively manage our exposure to interest rate risk by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap all or a portion of our variable rate debt in addition we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and other terms are appropriate our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful 

our use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations or that we could be required to fund our contractual payment obligations under such arrangements in relatively large amounts or on short notice developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs 

risks relating to income taxes 

simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership have elected to be taxed as reits in the united states and certain international operations also are structured to be taxed in a manner similar to the reit structure the failure to maintain simon’s or these subsidiaries’ qualifications as reits or changes in local tax laws or regulations in certain of our international operations could result in adverse tax consequences 

we are subject to certain incomebased taxes both domestically and internationally and other taxes including state and local taxes franchise taxes and withholding taxes on dividends from certain of our international investments we currently follow local tax laws and regulations in various domestic and international jurisdictions should these laws or regulations change the amount of taxes we pay may increase accordingly 

in the united states simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership have elected to be taxed as reits under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code we believe simon and these subsidiaries have been organized and operated in a manner which allows them to qualify for taxation as reits under the internal revenue code we intend to continue to operate in this manner however qualification and taxation as reits depend upon the ability of simon and these subsidiaries to satisfy several requirements some of which are outside our control including tests related to our annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various reit qualification tests required by the internal revenue code are highly technical and complex accordingly there can be no assurance that simon or any of these subsidiaries has operated in accordance with these requirements or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

 

if simon or any of these subsidiaries fail to comply with those provisions simon or any such subsidiary may be subject to monetary penalties or ultimately to possible disqualification as reits if such events occur and if available relief provisions do not apply 







moreover a failure by any of these subsidiaries to qualify as a reit would also cause simon to fail to qualify as a reit and the same adverse consequences would apply to it and its stockholders  

legislative administrative regulatory or other actions affecting reits including positions taken by the irs could have a material adverse effect on us or our investors 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the treasury changes to the tax laws or interpretations thereof by the irs and the treasury with or without retroactive application could materially and adversely affect us or our investors new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect the ability of simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership to qualify to be taxed as reits andor the us federal income tax consequences to us and our investors of such qualification 

reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan 

in order for simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership to qualify to be taxed as reits and assuming that certain other requirements are also satisfied simon and each such subsidiary generally must distribute at least 90 of their respective reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains to their respective equity holders each year to this point simon and each such subsidiary have historically distributed at least 100 of taxable income and thereby avoided income tax altogether to the extent that simon or any such subsidiary satisfies this distribution requirement and qualifies for taxation as a reit but distributes less than 100 of its reit taxable income simon or any such subsidiary will be subject to us federal corporate income tax on its undistributed net taxable income and could be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that is distributed to equity holders in a calendar year is less than “the required minimum distribution amount” specified under us federal income tax laws we intend to make distributions to the equity holders of simon and the aforementioned subsidiaries of the operating partnership to comply with the reit requirements of the internal revenue code 

from time to time simon and the aforementioned subsidiaries of the operating partnership might generate taxable income greater than their respective cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments if simon and these subsidiaries do not have other funds available in these situations simon and these subsidiaries could be required to access capital on unfavorable terms the receipt of which cannot be assured sell assets at disadvantageous prices distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions capital expenditures or repayment of debt or make taxable distributions of capital stock or debt securities to make distributions sufficient to enable them to pay out enough of their respective reit taxable income to satisfy the reit distribution requirement and avoid corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase costs or reduce our equity further amounts distributed will not be available to fund the growth of our business thus compliance with the reit requirements may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan 

complying with reit requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive acquisition opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments 

to qualify to be taxed as reits for us federal income tax purposes simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of their respective 

 

assets consist of cash cash items government securities and “real estate assets” as defined in the internal revenue code including certain mortgage loans and securities the remainder of their respective investments other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable reit subsidiary or trs generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer 

additionally in general no more than 5 of the value of simon’s and these subsidiaries’ total assets other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a trs can consist of the securities of any one issuer and no more than 25 20 for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 of the value of their respective total assets can be represented by securities of one or more trss if simon or any of these subsidiaries fails to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter simon or any such subsidiary must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing its reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences as a result we might be required to liquidate or forego otherwise attractive investments these actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to equity holders 

in addition to the asset tests set forth above to qualify to be taxed as reits simon and these subsidiaries must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of their respective income the amounts they distribute to equity holders and the ownership of their respective shares we might be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the source‑of‑income or asset‑diversification requirements for qualifying as reits thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments 

partnership tax audit rules could have a material adverse effect on us 

the bipartisan budget act of 2015 changes the rules applicable to us federal income tax audits of partnerships under the rules which are generally effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 among other changes and subject to certain exceptions any audit adjustment to items of income gain loss deduction or credit of a partnership and any partner’s distributive share thereof is determined and taxes interest or penalties attributable thereto could be assessed and collected at the partnership level although it is uncertain how these rules will be implemented it is possible that they could result in partnerships in which we directly or indirectly invest being required to pay additional taxes interest and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment and we as a direct or indirect partner of these partnerships could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes interest and penalties even though simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership as reits may not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporate‑level taxes had they owned the assets of the partnership directly the partnership tax audit rules will apply to the operating partnership and its subsidiaries that are classified as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes the changes created by these rules are sweeping and in many respects dependent on the promulgation of future regulations or other guidance by the us department of the treasury or the treasury and accordingly there can be no assurance that these rules will not have a material adverse effect on us 

risks relating to joint ventures 

we have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance them 

as of december 31 2016 we owned interests in 95 income‑producing properties with other parties of those 17 properties are included in our consolidated financial statements we account for the other 78 properties or the joint venture properties as well as our investments in klépierre a publicly traded parisbased real estate company aéropostale and hbs global properties or hbs using the equity method of accounting we serve as general partner or property manager for 57 of these 78 joint venture properties however certain major decisions such as approving the operating budget and selling refinancing and redeveloping the properties require the consent of the other owners of the joint venture properties for which we do not serve as general partner or property manager 17 are in our international joint ventures these international properties are managed locally by joint ventures in which we share control of the properties with our partner the other owners have participating rights that we consider substantive for purposes of determining control over the joint venture properties’ assets the remaining joint venture properties klépierre and our joint ventures with aéropostale and hbs are managed by third parties 

these investments and other future similar investments could involve risks that would not be present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or other owners might become bankrupt suffer a deterioration in their creditworthiness or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or other owners could have 

 

economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our own business interests or goals and could be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives 

these investments and other future similar investments also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions such as a sale or financing because neither we nor our partner or other owner has full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or other owners might result in litigation or arbitration that could increase our expenses and prevent simon’s officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or other owners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we risk the possibility of being liable for the actions of our partners or other owners 

the operating partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties 

joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property which is non‑recourse to us nevertheless the joint venture’s failure to satisfy its debt obligations could result in the loss of our investment therein as of december 31 2016 the operating partnership guaranteed joint venture related mortgage indebtedness of 4005 million of which we have a right of recovery from our joint venture partners of 873 million a default by a joint venture under its debt obligations would expose us to liability under a guaranty we may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests advances or partner loans although such fundings are not typically required contractually or otherwise 

risks relating to environmental matters 

as owners of real estate we can face liabilities for environmental contamination 

us federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require us as a current or previous owner or operator of real property to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at a property or at impacted neighboring properties these laws often impose liability regardless of whether the property owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances these laws and regulations may require the abatement or removal of asbestos containing materials in the event of damage demolition or renovation reconstruction or expansion of a property and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air those laws and regulations also govern the installation maintenance and removal of underground storage tanks used to store waste oils or other petroleum products many of our properties contain or at one time contained asbestos containing materials or underground storage tanks primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment we may be subject to regulatory action and may also be held liable to third parties for personal injury or property damage incurred by the parties in connection with any such laws and regulations or hazardous or toxic substances the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances and related liabilities may be substantial and could materially and adversely affect us the presence of hazardous or toxic substances or the failure to remediate the related contamination may also adversely affect our ability to sell lease or redevelop a property or to borrow money using a property as collateral 

our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful 

although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with us federal state and local environmental laws and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances this belief is based on limited testing nearly all of our properties have been subjected to phase i or similar environmental audits these environmental audits have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us however we cannot assure you that 









 

other factors affecting our business 

some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance 

we maintain insurance coverage with third‑party carriers who provide a portion of the coverage for specific layers of potential losses including commercial general liability fire flood extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties in the united states the initial portion of coverage not provided by third‑party carriers is either insured through our wholly‑owned captive insurance company or other financial arrangements controlled by us a third‑party carrier has in turn agreed to provide if required evidence of coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carrier’s policy a similar policy written through our captive insurance entity also provides initial coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal windstorm locations 

there are some types of losses including lease and other contract claims which generally are not insured or are subject to large deductibles if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue it could generate but may remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligation related to the property 

we currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the united states on an “all risk” basis in the amount of up to 1 billion the current us federal laws which provide this coverage are expected to operate through 2020 however the us government could in the future terminate its reinsurance of terrorism which would increase the risk of uninsured losses for terrorist acts despite the existence of this insurance coverage any threatened or actual terrorist attacks where we operate could materially and adversely affect us 

we face risks associated with security breaches through cyber‑attacks cyber intrusions or otherwise as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology it networks and related systems 

we face risks associated with security breaches whether through cyber‑attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet malware computer viruses attachments to e‑mails persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day‑to‑day operations and in some cases may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging even the most well protected information networks systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed not to be detected and in fact may not be detected accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk 

a breach or significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our systems including our primary website could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers tenants and revenues generate third party claims result in the unintended andor unauthorized public disclosure or the misappropriation of proprietary personal identifying and confidential information and require us to incur significant expenses to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues and we may not be able to recover these expenses in whole or in any part from our service providers or responsible parties or their or our insurers 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain talented employees and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our business 

the success of our business depends in part on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees and our ability to attract retain and motivate talented employees could significantly impact our future performance competition for these individuals is intense and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive management team and other key employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on us 

provisions in simon’s charter and by‑laws and in the operating partnership’s partnership agreement could prevent a change of control 

simon’s charter contains a general restriction on the accumulation of shares in excess of 8 of its capital stock the charter permits the members of the simon family and related persons to own up to 18 of simon’s capital stock 

 

ownership is determined by the lower of the number of outstanding shares voting power or value controlled simon’s board of directors may by majority vote permit exceptions to those levels in circumstances where simon’s board of directors determines that simon’s ability to qualify as a reit will not be jeopardized these restrictions on ownership may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interest of simon’s stockholders or the operating partnership’s unitholders or preferred unitholders other provisions of simon’s charter and by‑laws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control even if some of simon’s stockholders or the operating partnership’s unitholders or preferred unitholders deem such a change to be in their best interests these include provisions preventing holders of simon’s common stock from acting by written consent and requiring that up to four directors in the aggregate may be elected by holders of class b common stock in addition certain provisions of the operating partnership’s partnership agreement could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control these include a provision requiring the consent of a majority in interest of units in order for simon as general partner of the operating partnership to among other matters engage in a merger transaction or sell all or substantially all of its assets 

we face possible risks associated with climate change 

we cannot determine with certainty whether global warming or cooling is occurring and if so at what rate to the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns our properties in certain markets could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea‑levels over time these conditions could result in volatile or decreased demand for retail space at certain of our properties or in extreme cases our inability to operate the properties at all climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of or making unavailable insurance on favorable terms or at all and increasing the cost of energy and snow removal at our properties moreover compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change including compliance with “green” building codes may require us to make improvements to our existing properties or increase taxes and fees assessed on us or our properties at this time there can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on us 

the united kingdom’s pending departure from the european union could have a material adverse effect on us 

the united kingdom held a referendum on june 23 2016 in which a majority of voters voted to exit the european union or brexit which has contributed to uncertainty in the global financial markets and affected markets in the united kingdom in particular negotiations are expected to commence to determine the future terms of the united kingdom’s relationship with the european union including among other things the terms of trade between the united kingdom and the european union the effects of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union will depend on agreements the united kingdom makes to retain access to european union markets either during a transitional period or more permanently brexit is likely to continue to impact the united kingdom european and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to greater instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets before and after the terms of the united kingdom’s future relationships with the european union are settled further financial and other markets may suffer losses as a result of other countries determining to withdraw from the european union or from any future significant changes to the european union’s structure andor regulations in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty as the united kingdom determines which european union laws to replace or replicate 

we currently hold and may acquire additional equity interests in properties located in the united kingdom and europe as well as other investments that are denominated in pounds sterling and euros in addition our operating partnership has issued and may issue in the future senior unsecured notes denominated in euros any of the effects of brexit described above and others we cannot anticipate could have a material adverse effect on us including the value of our properties and investments and our potential growth in europe and could amplify the currency risks faced by us

we generate the majority of our revenues from leases with retail tenants including 







revenues of our management company after intercompany eliminations consist primarily of management fees that are typically based upon the revenues of the property being managed 

we invest in real estate properties to maximize total financial return which includes both operating cash flows and capital appreciation we seek growth in earnings funds from operations or ffo and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments we seek to accomplish this growth through the following 











we also grow by generating supplemental revenue from the following activities 



 









we focus on high quality real estate across the retail real estate spectrum we expand or redevelop properties to enhance profitability and market share of existing assets when we believe the investment of our capital meets our risk‑reward criteria we selectively develop new properties in markets we believe are not adequately served by existing retail outlet properties 

we routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio our international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk 

to support our growth we employ a three‑fold capital strategy 







we consider ffo net operating income or noi and comparable property noi noi for properties owned and operated in both periods under comparison to be key measures of operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or gaap we use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure are included below in this discussion 

results overview 

diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per unit decreased 001 during 2016 to 587 as compared to 588 in 2015 the decrease in diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per unit was primarily attributable to 



  

















 

core business fundamentals improved during 2016 primarily driven by increased leasing activity portfolio noi grew by 67 in 2016 as compared to 2015 comparable property noi grew 36 for our portfolio of us malls premium outlets and the mills total sales per square foot or psf were relatively flat at 614 psf at december 31 2016 compared to 620 psf at december 31 2015 for our us malls and premium outlets average base minimum rent for us malls and premium outlets increased 54 to 5159 psf as of december 31 2016 from 4896 psf as of december 31 2015 leasing spreads in our us malls and premium outlets were favorable as we were able to lease available square feet at higher rents resulting in an openclose leasing spread based on total tenant payments — base minimum rent plus common area maintenance of 782 psf 6920 openings compared to 6138 closings as of december 31 2016 representing a 127 increase ending occupancy for our us malls and premium outlets was near historically peak levels at 968 as of december 31 2016 as compared to 961 as of december 31 2015 an increase of 70 basis points primarily due to the effect of vacancies created as a result of tenant bankruptcies during 2015 

our effective overall borrowing rate at december 31 2016 on our consolidated indebtedness decreased 49 basis points to 339 as compared to 388 at december 31 2015 this reduction was primarily due to a decrease in the effective overall borrowing rate on fixed rate debt of 66 basis points 346 at december 31 2016 as compared to 412 at december 31 2015 partially offset by an increase in the effective overall borrowing rate on variable rate debt of 26 basis points 176 at december 31 2016 as compared to 150 at december 31 2015 at december 31 2016 the weighted average years to maturity of our consolidated indebtedness was 74 years as compared to 59 years at december 31 2015 

our financing activities for the year ended december 31 2016 included 























united states portfolio data 

the portfolio data discussed in this overview includes the following key operating statistics ending occupancy average base minimum rent per square foot and total sales per square foot for our domestic assets we include acquired 

 

properties in this data beginning in the year of acquisition and remove disposed properties in the year of disposition the washington prime group inc or washington prime properties have been removed from the portfolio data for all periods presented for comparative purposes we separate the information related to the mills from our other us operations we also do not include any properties located outside the united states 

the following table sets forth these key operating statistics for 











ending occupancy levels and average base minimum rent per square foot ending occupancy is the percentage of gross leasable area or gla which is leased as of the last day of the reporting period we include all company owned space except for mall anchors mall majors mall freestanding and mall outlots in the calculation base minimum rent per square foot is the average base minimum rent charge in effect for the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in ending occupancy 

total sales per square foot   total sales include total reported retail tenant sales on a trailing 12‑month basis at owned gla for mall stores with less than 10000 square feet in the malls and the mills and stores with less than 20000 square feet in the premium outlets retail sales at owned gla affect revenue and profitability levels because sales determine the amount of minimum rent that can be charged the percentage rent realized and the recoverable expenses common area maintenance real estate taxes etc that tenants can afford to pay 

current leasing activities 

during 2016 we signed 960 new leases and 1270 renewal leases excluding mall anchors and majors new development redevelopment and leases with terms of one year or less with a fixed minimum rent across our us malls

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

minimum rents increased 2162 million during 2016 of which the property transactions accounted for 735 million of the increase comparable rents increased 1427 million or 46 primarily attributable to an increase in base minimum rents as well as incremental revenue from our redevelopment and expansion activity overage rent decreased 326 million as a result of decreased tenant sales and an increase in the overage breakpoints as compared to 2015 

tenant reimbursements increased 492 million due to a 222 million increase attributable to the property transactions and a 270 million or 19 increase in the comparable properties due to annual fixed contractual increases related to common area maintenance and real estate tax recoveries 

total other income decreased 491 million primarily due to an 802 million gain on the sale of marketable securities recorded during 2015 and a 250 million decrease in lease settlement income partially offset by a 362 million pretax gain on the sale of our investments in two multifamily residential investments during 2016 a 76 million increase in land sale activity and an increase in simon brand ventures and gift card revenue of 131 million 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 751 million primarily due to the additional depreciable assets related to the property transactions and our continued redevelopment and expansion activities 

other expenses increased 141 million primarily due to the write off of predevelopment costs of 315 million related to the copley residential tower project that we are no longer pursuing partially offset by a decrease in legal costs and professional fees and a more favorable net foreign currency revaluation impact on foreign currency‑denominated assets and liabilities during 2015

real estate taxes increased 487 million of which the property transactions accounted for 153 million with the remaining increase primarily caused by higher tax estimates in 2015 

during 2015 we recorded a provision for credit losses of 66 million whereas in the prior year the provision was 120 million a reflection of the overall strong economic health of our tenants 

other expenses increased 112 million primarily due to an increase in legal costs and professional fees as well as acquisition‑related costs in the first quarter of 2015 partially offset by a favorable net foreign currency revaluation impact on foreign currency‑denominated assets and liabilities 

interest expense decreased 689 million primarily due to the net impact of our financing activities during 2015 and 2014 and the reduction in our effective overall borrowing rate as previously discussed 

during 2015 we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of 1210 million as a result of an early redemption of senior unsecured notes during 2014 we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of 1276 million as a result of the tender offers and redemption of senior unsecured notes

simon’s net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 687 million due to an increase in the net income of the operating partnership 

liquidity and capital resources 

because we own long‑lived income‑producing assets our financing strategy relies primarily on long‑term fixed rate debt floating rate debt comprised only 38 of our total consolidated debt at december 31 2016 we also enter into interest rate protection agreements to manage our interest rate risk we derive most of our liquidity from positive net cash flow from operations and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities that totaled 39 billion in the aggregate during 2016 in addition the credit facilities and the commercial paper program provide alternative sources of liquidity as our cash needs vary from time to time borrowing capacity under these sources may be increased as discussed further below 

our balance of cash and cash equivalents decreased 1411 million during 2016 to 5601 million as of december 31 2016 as further discussed in “cash flows” below 

on december 31 2016 we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of approximately 62 billion under the credit facilities net of outstanding borrowings of 3165 million and amounts outstanding under the commercial paper 

 

program of 9537 million and letters of credit of 188 million for the year ended december 31 2016 the maximum amount outstanding under the credit facilities was 15 billion and the weighted average amount outstanding was 5964 million the weighted average interest rate was 095 for the year ended december 31 2016 further on april 6 2016 the operating partnership amended the supplemental facility to among other matters i exercise its 7500 million accordion feature such that the supplemental facility’s borrowing capacity was increased from 275 billion to 350 billion and ii add a new 7500 million accordion feature to permit us to further increase the supplemental facility’s borrowing capacity to 425 billion during its term 

simon has historically had access to public equity markets and the operating partnership has historically had access to private and public long and shortterm unsecured debt markets and access to secured debt and private equity from institutional investors at the property level 

our business model and simon’s status as a reit require us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition development and redevelopment activity and to refinance maturing debt simon may also from time to time access the equity capital markets to accomplish our business objectives we believe we have sufficient cash on hand and availability under the credit facilities and the commercial paper program to address our debt maturities and capital needs through 2017 

cash flows 

our net cash flow from operating activities and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities totaled 39 billion during 2016 in addition we had net proceeds from our debt financing and repayment activities including the 1368 million debt extinguishment charge of 793 million in 2016 these activities are further discussed below under “financing and debt” during 2016 we also 













in general we anticipate that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating expenses monthly debt service recurring capital expenditures and dividends to stockholders andor distributions to partners necessary to maintain simon’s reit qualification on a long‑term basis in addition we expect to be able to generate or obtain capital for nonrecurring capital expenditures such as acquisitions major building redevelopments and expansions as well as for scheduled principal maturities on outstanding indebtedness from 









we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2017 and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash these cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our retail tenants a significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds from the credit facilities and commercial paper program curtail planned capital expenditures or seek other additional sources of financing as discussed above

during 2016 we disposed of our interests in two unconsolidated multifamily residential investments three consolidated retail properties and four unconsolidated retail properties our share of the gross proceeds from these transactions was 818 million the gain on the consolidated retail properties was 124 million the gain on the unconsolidated retail properties was 226 million the aggregate gain of 362 million from the sale of the two unconsolidated residential investments is included in other income and resulted in an additional 72 million in taxes included in income and other taxes as discussed in note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements klépierre disposed of its interest in certain scandinavian properties during the fourth quarter resulting in a gain of which our share was 81 million 

joint venture formation activity

on july 22 2015 we closed on our previously announced joint venture with hbc to which hbc contributed 42 properties in the us and we committed to contribute 1000 million for improvements to the properties contributed by hbc in exchange for a noncontrolling equity interest in hbs as of december 31 2016 we have funded 306 million of this commitment on september 30 2015 hbc announced it had closed on the acquisition of galeria holding the parent company of germany’s leading department store kaufhof in conjunction with the closing hbs acquired 41 kaufhof properties in germany from hbc all of these properties have been leased to affiliates of hbc we contributed an additional 1785 million to hbs upon closing of the galeria holding transaction our noncontrolling equity interest in hbs is approximately 102 at december 31 2016

development activity 

new domestic developments redevelopments and expansions 

during 2016 the following properties opened 







in addition construction continues on the following properties 





we routinely incur costs related to construction for significant redevelopment and expansion projects at our properties redevelopment and expansion projects including the addition of anchors big box tenants and restaurants are underway at 27 properties in the united states 

during the fourth quarter of 2016 we determined we would no longer pursue the construction of copley residential tower given a change in property approval dynamics construction pricing in the boston market and the continued increase in residential supply in the market accordingly we recorded a charge of approximately 315 million related to the writeoff of predevelopment costs 

summary of capital expenditures the following table summarizes total capital expenditures on consolidated properties on a cash basis in millions 



our share of the costs of all development redevelopment and expansion projects currently under construction is approximately 16 billion we expect to fund these capital projects with cash flows from operations our estimated stabilized return on invested capital typically ranges between 710 for all of our new development expansion and redevelopment projects 

international development activity we typically reinvest net cash flow from our international joint ventures to fund future international development activity we believe this strategy mitigates some of the risk of our initial investment and our exposure to changes in foreign currencies we have also funded most of our foreign investments with local currency‑denominated borrowings that act as a natural hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates our consolidated net income exposure to changes in the volatility of the euro yen won and other foreign currencies is not material we expect 

 

our share of international development costs for 2017 will be approximately 179 million primarily funded through reinvested joint venture cash flow and construction loans 

the following table describes these new development and expansion projects as well as our share of the estimated total cost as of december 31 2016 in millions 



  

dividends distributions and stock repurchase program 

simon paid a common stock dividend of 165 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 650 per share for the year ended december 31 2016 the operating partnership made distributions per unit for the same amounts in 2015 simon paid dividends of 160 and 605 per share for the three and twelve month periods ended december 31 2015 respectively the operating partnership made distributions per unit for the same amounts simon’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend for the first quarter of 2017 of 175 per share of common stock payable on february 28 2017 to stockholders of record on february 14 2017 the distribution rate on units is equal to the dividend rate on common stock in order to maintain its status as a reit simon must pay a minimum amount of dividends simon’s future dividends and the operating partnership’s future distributions will be determined by simon’s board of directors in its sole discretion based on actual and projected financial condition liquidity and results of operations cash available for dividends and limited partner distributions cash reserves as deemed necessary for capital and operating expenditures financing covenants if any and the amount required to maintain simon’s status as a reit 

on april 2 2015 simon’s board of directors authorized simon to repurchase up to 20 billion of common stock over a twentyfour month period as market conditions warrant and on february 13 2017 simon’s board of directors authorized a twoyear extension of the program through march 31 2019 simon may repurchase the shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions during the year ended december 31 2016 simon repurchased 1409197 shares at an average price of 18114 per share of its common stock as part of this program during the year ended december 31 2015 simon repurchased 1903340 shares at an average price of 18019 per share as part of this program as simon repurchases shares under this program the operating partnership repurchases an equal number of units from simon 

forward‑looking statements 

certain statements made in this section or elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k may be deemed forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 although we believe the expectations reflected in any forwardlooking statements are based on reasonable assumptions we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained and it is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forwardlooking statements due to a variety of risks uncertainties and other factors such factors include but are not limited to changes in economic and market conditions that adversely affect the general retail environment the potential loss of anchor stores or major tenants the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or 

 

otherwise decreases in market rental rates the intensely competitive market environment in the retail industry the inability to lease newly developed properties and renew leases and relet space at existing properties on favorable terms risks related to international activities including without limitation the impact of the united kingdom’s vote to leave the european union changes to applicable laws or regulations or the interpretation thereof risks associated with the acquisition development redevelopment expansion leasing and management of properties general risks related to real estate investments including the illiquidity of real estate investments the impact of our substantial indebtedness on our future operations any disruption in the financial markets that adversely affects our ability to access capital for growth and satisfy our ongoing debt service requirements any change in our credit rating changes in market rates of interest and foreign exchange rates for foreign currencies changes in the value of our investments in foreign entities our ability to hedge interest rate and currency risk our continued ability to maintain our status as a reit changes in tax laws or regulations that result in adverse tax consequences risks relating to our joint venture properties environmental liabilities changes in insurance costs the availability of comprehensive insurance coverage security breaches that could compromise our information technology or infrastructure natural disasters the potential for terrorist activities and the loss of key management personnel we discussed these and other risks and uncertainties under the heading risk factors in part i item1a of this annual report on form 10k we may update that discussion in subsequent other periodic reports but except as required by law we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise these forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise 

non‑gaap financial measures 

industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties in part based on performance measures such as ffo diluted ffo per share noi portfolio noi and comparable property noi we believe that these non‑gaap measures are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of reits and provide a relevant basis for comparison among reits we also use these measures internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio 

we determine ffo based on the definition set forth by the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit as consolidated net income computed in accordance with gaap 













we have adopted nareit’s clarification of the definition of ffo that requires us to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary cumulative effect of accounting changes or a gain or loss resulting from the sale of or any impairment charges related to previously depreciated retail operating properties 

we include in ffo gains and losses realized from the sale of land outlot buildings marketable and non‑marketable securities and investment holdings of non‑retail real estate we also include in ffo the impact of foreign currency exchange gains and losses legal expenses transaction expenses and other items required by gaap 

you should understand that our computations of these non‑gaap measures might not be comparable to similar measures reported by other reits and that these non‑gaap measures 







 

the following schedule reconciles total ffo to consolidated net income and for simon diluted net income per share to diluted ffo per share 











 

the following schedule reconciles consolidated net income to noi and sets forth the computations of portfolio noi and comparable noi 











item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk 

our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our long‑term debt obligations we manage exposure to interest rate market risk through our risk management strategy by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of variable rate debt we are also exposed to foreign currency risk 

 

on financings of certain foreign operations our intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging these exposures we do not enter into either interest rate protection or foreign currency rate protection agreements for speculative purposes 

we may enter into treasury lock agreements as part of anticipated issuances of senior notes upon completion of the debt issuance the cost of these instruments is recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt agreement 

our future earnings cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest primarily libor which was at historically low levels during 2016 based upon consolidated indebtedness and interest rates at december 31 2016 a 50 basis point increase in the market rates of interest would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 45 million and would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately 6844 million

for a description of our operational strategies and developments in our business during 2015 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form 10k 

other policies 

the following is a discussion of our investment policies financing policies conflict of interest policies and policies with respect to certain other activities one or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote 

investment policies 

while we emphasize equity real estate investments we may also provide secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers however any of these investments would be subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for reit qualification these reit limitations mean that we cannot make an investment that would cause our real estate assets to be less than 75 of our total assets we must also derive at least 75 of our gross income directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including rents from real property dividends from other reits and in certain circumstances interest from certain types of temporary investments in addition we must also derive at least 95 of our gross income from such real property investments and from dividends interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing 

subject to reit limitations we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate such an investment would normally be in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties we may in the future acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies 

financing policies 

because our reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income we regularly access the debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions develop and redevelop properties and refinance maturing debt we must comply with the covenants contained in our financing agreements that limit our ratio of debt to total assets or market value as defined for example the operating partnerships line of credit and the indentures for the operating partnerships debt securities contain covenants that restrict the total amount of debt of the operating partnership to 65 or 60 in relation to certain debt of total assets as defined under the related agreements and secured debt to 50 of total assets in addition these agreements contain other covenants requiring compliance with financial 

ratios furthermore the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for the debt securities of the operating partnership we strive to maintain investment grade ratings at all times for various business reasons including their effect on our ability to access attractive capital but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so in the future 

if our board of directors determines to seek additional capital we may raise such capital by offering equity or incurring debt creating joint ventures with existing ownership interests in properties entering into joint venture arrangements for new development projects retaining cash flows or a combination of these methods if our board of directors determines to raise equity capital it may without stockholder approval issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock our board of directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate such securities may be senior to our outstanding classes of common stock such securities also may include additional classes of preferred stock which may be convertible into common stock existing stockholders have no preemptive right to purchase shares in any subsequent offering of our securities any such offering could dilute a stockholders investment in us 

we expect most future borrowings will be made through the operating partnership or its subsidiaries we might however incur borrowings through other entities that would be reloaned to the operating partnership borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings publicly and privately placed debt instruments or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties any such indebtedness may be secured or unsecured any such indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to the borrower or be crosscollateralized with other debt or may be fully or partially guaranteed by the operating partnership we issue debt securities through the operating partnership but we may issue our debt securities which may be convertible to common or preferred stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase common or preferred stock we also may sell or securitize our lease receivables although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends we currently have no expectation that we will regularly do so 

the operating partnership has a 40 billion unsecured revolving credit facility or credit facility the credit facilitys initial borrowing capacity of 40 billion may be increased to 50 billion during its term the initial maturity date of the credit facility is june 30 2018 and can be extended for an additional year to june 30 2019 at our sole option subject to our continued compliance with the terms thereof the operating partnership also has a 275 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility or supplemental facility and together with the credit facility the credit facilities on march 2 2015 the operating partnership amended and extended the supplemental facility the initial borrowing capacity of 20 billion was increased to 275 billion may be further increased to 35 billion during its term will initially mature on june 30 2019 and can be extended for an additional year to june 30 2020 at our sole option subject to our continued compliance with the terms thereof the base interest rate on each of the credit facility and the supplemental facility is libor plus 80 basis points with an additional facility fee of 10 basis points the credit facilities provide for borrowings denominated in us dollars euros yen sterling canadian dollars and australian dollars 

on march 2 2015 the operating partnership increased the maximum aggregate program size of its global unsecured commercial paper note program or the commercial paper program from 5000 million to 10 billion or the nonus dollar equivalent thereof the operating partnership may issue unsecured commercial paper notes denominated in us dollars euros and other currencies notes issued in nonus currencies may be issued by one or more subsidiaries of the operating partnership and are guaranteed by the operating partnership these notes are sold under customary terms in the us and euro commercial paper note markets and rank either by themselves or as a result of the guarantee described above pari passu with the operating partnerships other unsecured senior indebtedness the commercial paper program is supported by the credit facilities and if necessary or appropriate we may make one or more draws under either the credit facilities to pay amounts outstanding from time to time on the commercial paper program 

we may also finance our business through the following 

• issuance of shares of common stock or preferred stock • issuance of additional common units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership or units • issuance of preferred units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership or preferred units • issuance of other securities including unsecured notes and mortgage debt • draws on our credit facilities • borrowings under the commercial paper program or • sale or exchange of ownership interests in properties 4 

the operating partnership may also issue units to contributors of properties or other partnership interests which may permit the contributor to defer tax gain recognition under the internal revenue code 

we do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property mortgage financing instruments however typically limit additional indebtedness on such properties additionally the credit facilities our unsecured note indentures and other contracts may limit our ability to borrow and contain limits on mortgage indebtedness we may incur as well as certain financial covenants we must maintain 

typically we invest in or form special purpose entities to assist us in obtaining secured permanent financing at attractive terms permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage loan on a single property or on a group of properties and generally requires us to provide a mortgage lien on the property or properties in favor of an institutional third party as a joint venture with a third party or as a securitized financing for securitized financings we create special purpose entities to own the properties these special purpose entities which are common in the real estate industry are structured so that they would not be consolidated in a bankruptcy proceeding involving a parent company we decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives for accounting purposes we include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness 

conflict of interest policies 

we maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest we have adopted governance principles governing the function conduct selection orientation and duties of our board of directors and the company as well as written charters for each of the standing committees of our board of directors in addition we have a code of business conduct and ethics which applies to all of our officers directors and employees and those of our subsidiaries at least a majority of the members of our board of directors must qualify as independent under the listing standards of the new york stock exchange or nyse and cannot be affiliated with the simon family who are significant stockholders andor unitholders in the operating partnership in addition the audit and compensation committees of our board of directors are comprised entirely of independent members who meet the additional independence and financial sophistication requirements of the nyse any transaction between us and the simons including property acquisitions service and property management agreements and retail space leases must be approved by a majority of our independent directors 

the sale by the operating partnership of any property that it owns may have an adverse tax impact on the simons or other limited partners of the operating partnership in order to avoid any conflict of interest between us and the simons our charter requires that at least threefourths of our independent directors must authorize and require the operating partnership to sell any property it owns any such sale is subject to applicable agreements with third parties noncompetition agreements executed by david simon our chairman and chief executive officer and herbert simon our chairman emeritus as well as david simons employment agreement contain covenants limiting their ability to participate in certain shopping center activities 

policies with respect to certain other activities 

we intend to make investments which are consistent with our qualification as a reit unless our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to so qualify as a reit our board of directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the reit requirements we have authority to issue shares of our capital stock or other securities in exchange for property we also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities on april 2 2015 our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to 20 billion of our common stock over a twentyfour month period as market conditions warrant or the repurchase program under the repurchase program we may repurchase the shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions we may also issue shares of our common stock or pay cash at our option to holders of units in future periods upon exercise of such holders rights under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership our policy prohibits us from making any loans to our directors or executive officers for any purpose we may make loans to the joint ventures in which we participate additionally we may make or buy interests in loans secured by real estate properties owned by others or make investments in companies that own real estate assets 

competition 

the retail industry is dynamic and competitive we compete with numerous merchandise distribution channels including malls outlet centers communitylifestyle centers and other shopping centers in the united states and abroad we also compete with internet retailing sites and catalogs which provide retailers with distribution options beyond existing 

brick and mortar retail properties the existence of competitive alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we can obtain this results in competition for both the tenants to occupy the properties that we develop and manage as well as for the acquisition of prime sites including land for development and operating properties we believe that there are numerous factors that make our properties highly desirable to retailers including

 item 1a risk factors 

  the following factors among others could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations funds from operations or ffo and prospects which we refer to herein as a material adverse effect on us or as materially and adversely affecting us and you should carefully consider them additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which are currently not believed to be material may also affect our actual results we may update these factors in our future periodic reports 

risks relating to retail operations 

  overall economic and market conditions may adversely affect the general retail environment 

our concentration in the retail real estate market means that we are subject to a number of factors that could adversely affect the retail environment generally including without limitation 

• changes in international national regional and local economic conditions • local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of or reduction in demand for retail space or retail goods decreases in rental rates declining real estate values and the availability and creditworthiness of tenants • levels of consumer spending changes in consumer confidence and fluctuations in seasonal spending • the willingness of retailers to lease space in our properties • tenant bankruptcies and a resulting rejection of our leases • the impact on our retail tenants and demand for retail space at our properties from the increasing use of the internet by retailers and consumers • perceptions by consumers of the safety convenience and attractiveness of our properties • increased operating costs • changes in applicable laws and regulations including tax environmental safety and zoning • casualties and other natural disasters and • the potential for terrorist activities we derive our operating results primarily from retail tenants many of whom have been and continue to be under some degree of economic stress a significant deterioration in the creditworthiness of our retail tenants could have a material adverse effect on us 

  we may not be able to lease newly developed properties and renew leases and relet space at existing properties 

we may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants also when leases for our existing properties expire the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms to the extent that our leasing goals are not achieved we could be materially and adversely affected 

  some of our properties depend on anchor stores or other major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more of these anchor stores or major tenants 

our properties are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally recognized tenants the value of some of our properties could be materially and adversely affected if these anchors or other major tenants fail to comply with their contractual obligations or cease their operations 

for example among department stores and other large stores — often referred to as big box stores — corporate merger activity typically results in the closure of duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations further sustained adverse pressure on the results of our department stores and major tenants may have a similarly sustained adverse impact upon our own results certain department stores and other national retailers have experienced and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future given current macroeconomic uncertainty and lessthandesirable levels of consumer 

confidence considerable decreases in customer traffic in their retail stores increased competition from alternative retail options such as those accessible via the internet and other forms of pressure on their business models as pressure on these department stores and national retailers increases their ability to maintain their stores meet their obligations both to us and to their external lenders and suppliers withstand takeover attempts by investors or rivals or avoid bankruptcy andor liquidation may be impaired and result in closures of their stores or their seeking of a lease modification with us any lease modification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and could decrease rents or expense recovery charges other tenants may be entitled to modify the economic or other terms of or terminate their existing leases with us in the event of such closures 

if a department store or major tenant were to close its stores at our properties we may experience difficulty and delay and incur significant expense in replacing the tenant as well as in leasing spaces in areas adjacent to the vacant department store or major tenant at attractive rates or at all additionally department store or major tenant closures may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sales at our properties if the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to the closing of anchor stores or other national retailers adverse economic conditions or other reasons tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges in the event of any default by a tenant we may not be able to fully recover andor may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with such parties 

  we face potential adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies 

bankruptcy filings by retailers can occur regularly in the course of our operations if a tenant files for bankruptcy the tenant may have the right to reject and terminate one or more of its leases with us and we cannot be sure that it will affirm one or more of its leases and continue to make rental payments to us in a timely manner a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants would bar all efforts by us to collect prebankruptcy debts from that tenant or from their property unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court in addition we cannot evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy if a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy all prebankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full however if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages in connection with such balances if a bankrupt tenant vacates a space it might not do so in a timely manner and we might be unable to release the vacated space during that time at attractive rates or at all furthermore we may be required to incur significant expense in replacing the bankrupt tenant any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims and there are restrictions under bankruptcy laws that limit the amount of the claim we can make if a lease is rejected as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold we continually seek to release vacant spaces resulting from tenant terminations the bankruptcy of a tenant particularly an anchor tenant or a national tenant with multiple locations may make the releasing of their space difficult and costly and it also may be more difficult to lease the remainder of the space at the affected properties future tenant bankruptcies may impact our ability to successfully execute our releasing strategy and could materially and adversely affect us 

  we face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably 

our properties compete with other retail properties and other forms of retailing such as catalogs and ecommerce websites competition may come from malls outlet centers communitylifestyle centers and other shopping centers both existing as well as future development and redevelopmentexpansion projects as well as catalogs and ecommerce the presence of competitive alternatives affects our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain new construction renovations and expansions at competing sites could also negatively affect our properties 

we also compete with other major real estate investors and developers for attractive investment opportunities and prime development sites competition for the acquisition of existing properties and development sites may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect our ability to make attractive investments on favorable terms or at all in addition we compete with other retail property companies for tenants and qualified management 

risks relating to real estate investments and operations 

  we face risks associated with the acquisition development redevelopment and expansion of properties 

we regularly acquire and develop new properties and redevelop and expand existing properties and these activities are subject to various risks we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition development or redevelopmentexpansion opportunities in addition newly acquired developed or redevelopedexpanded properties may not perform as well as 

expected impacting our anticipated return on investment we are subject to other risks in connection with any acquisition development and redevelopmentexpansion activities including the following 

• acquisition or construction costs of a project may be higher than projected potentially making the project unfeasible or unprofitable • development or redevelopment may take considerably longer than expected delaying the commencement and amount of income from the property • we may not be able to obtain financing or to refinance loans on favorable terms or at all • we may be unable to obtain zoning occupancy or other governmental approvals • occupancy rates and rents may not meet our projections and the project may not be profitable and • we may need the consent of third parties such as department stores anchor tenants mortgage lenders and joint venture partners and those consents may be withheld if a development or redevelopmentexpansion project is unsuccessful either because it is not meeting our expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project planning we could lose our investment in the project further if we guarantee the propertys financing our loss could exceed our investment in the project 

  real estate investments are relatively illiquid 

our properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets these investments are relatively illiquid as a result our ability to sell one or more of our properties or investments in real estate in response to any changes in economic industry or other conditions may be limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability and terms of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand for space that are beyond our control if we want to sell a property we cannot assure you that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or at all or that the sales price of a property will be attractive at the relevant time or even exceed the carrying value of our investment moreover if a property is mortgaged we may not be able to obtain a release of the lien on that property without the payment of the associated debt andor a substantial prepayment penalty which could restrict our ability to dispose of the property even though the sale might otherwise be desirable 

  our international activities may subject us to different or greater risk from those associated with our domestic operations 

as of december 31 2015 we held interests in joint venture properties that operate in austria italy japan malaysia mexico the netherlands south korea canada and the united kingdom we also have an equity stake in klépierre a publiclytraded european real estate company which operates in 16 countries in europe accordingly our operating results and the value of our international operations may be impacted by any unhedged movements in the foreign currencies in which those operations transact and in which our net investment in the international operation is held we may pursue additional investment development and redevelopmentexpansion opportunities outside the united states international investment ownership development and redevelopmentexpansion activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our domestic properties and operations these risks include but are not limited to 

• adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies • changes in foreign political and economic environments regionally nationally and locally • challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws including corporate governance operations taxes and litigation • differing lending practices • differences in cultures • changes in applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect international operations • difficulties in managing international operations and • obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash our international activities represented approximately 79 of our net operating income or noi for the year ended december 31 2015 to the extent that we expand our international activities the above risks could increase in significance which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us 

risks relating to debt and the financial markets 

  we have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations 

as of december 31 2015 our consolidated mortgages and unsecured indebtedness excluding related premium and discount totaled 225 billion as a result of this indebtedness we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows for debt service including selected repayment at scheduled maturities which limits our ability to use those cash flows to fund the growth of our business we are also subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flows from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service or that we will be able to refinance such indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the applicable property such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants cause a reduction in the income from the property our indebtedness could also have other adverse consequences on us including reducing our access to capital or increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic industry and market conditions in addition if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value if any of the foregoing occurs we could be materially and adversely affected 

  disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements 

we depend on external financings principally debt financings to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt our access to financing depends on the willingness of lending institutions and other debt investors to grant credit to us and conditions in the capital markets in general an economic recession may cause extreme volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets we rely upon the credit facilities as sources of funding for numerous transactions our access to these funds is dependent upon the ability of each of the participants to the credit facilities to meet their funding commitments to us when markets are volatile access to capital and credit markets could be disrupted over an extended period of time and one or more financial institutions may not have the available capital to meet their previous commitments to us the failure of one or more participants to the credit facilities to meet their funding commitments to us could have a material adverse effect on us including as a result of making it difficult to obtain the financing we may need for future growth andor meeting our debt service requirements we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for the future growth of our business or to meet our debt service requirements or that a sufficient amount of financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 

  adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

the operating partnerships outstanding senior unsecured notes credit facilities the commercial paper program and simons preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios financial condition and prospects and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and the economic outlook in general our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund the growth of our business an adverse change in our credit rating including actual changes and changes in outlook or even the initiation of a review of our credit rating that could result in an adverse change could have a material adverse effect on us 

  the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that might affect our ability to operate freely 

we have a variety of unsecured debt including the credit facilities and secured propertylevel debt certain of the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain covenants including among other things limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured indebtedness sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and certain acquisitions in addition certain of the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain financial covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios including certain coverage ratios these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous to us in addition our ability to comply with these provisions might be affected by events beyond our control failure to comply with any of our financing covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate the related indebtedness as well as other of our indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on us 

  our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk 

we selectively manage our exposure to interest rate risk by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap all or a portion of our variable rate debt in addition we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and other terms are appropriate our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful 

our use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations or that we could be required to fund our contractual payment obligations under such arrangements in relatively large amounts or on short notice developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs 

risks relating to income taxes 

  we have elected to be taxed as a reit in the united states and certain of our international operations currently receive favorable tax treatment 

we are subject to certain incomebased taxes both domestically and internationally and other taxes including state and local taxes franchise taxes and withholding taxes on dividends from certain of our international investments we currently receive favorable tax treatment in various domestic and international jurisdictions through tax rules and regulations or through international treaties should we no longer receive such benefits the amount of taxes we pay may increase 

in the united states we have elected to be taxed as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code we believe we have been organized and operated in a manner which allows us to qualify for taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code we intend to continue to operate in this manner however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the internal revenue code reit qualification is governed by highly technical and complex provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

if we fail to comply with those provisions we may be subject to monetary penalties or ultimately to possible disqualification as a reit if such events occurs and if available relief provisions do not apply 

• we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our reit taxable income • we will be subject to corporate level income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our reit taxable income at regular corporate rates and • unless entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions we will also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost   reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan 

in order for us to qualify to be taxed as a reit and assuming that certain other requirements are also satisfied we generally must distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains to our stockholders each year so that federal corporate income tax does not apply to earnings that we distribute to the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement and qualify for taxation as a reit but distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and including any net capital gains we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed net taxable income in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than the required minimum distribution amount specified under federal income tax laws we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the reit requirements of the internal revenue code 

from time to time we might generate taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments if we do not have other funds available in these situations we could be required to access capital on unfavorable terms the receipt of which cannot be assured sell assets at disadvantageous prices distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions capital 

expenditures or repayment of debt or make taxable distributions of our capital stock or debt securities to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the reit distribution requirement and avoid corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity further amounts distributed will not be available to fund the growth of our business thus compliance with the reit requirements may adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan 

  complying with reit requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive acquisition opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments 

to qualify to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes we must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of our assets consist of cash cash items government securities and real estate assets as defined in the internal revenue code including certain mortgage loans and securities the remainder of our investments other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable reit subsidiary or trs generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer 

additionally in general no more than 5 of the value of our total assets other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a trs can consist of the securities of any one issuer and no more than 25 20 for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more trss if we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences as a result we might be required to liquidate or forego otherwise attractive investments these actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders 

in addition to the asset tests set forth above to qualify to be taxed as a reit we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our shares we might be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the sourceofincome or assetdiversification requirements for qualifying as a reit thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments 

  new partnership tax audit rules could have a material adverse effect on us 

the recently enacted bipartisan budget act of 2015 changes the rules applicable to federal income tax audits of partnerships under the new rules which are generally effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 among other changes and subject to certain exceptions any audit adjustment to items of income gain loss deduction or credit of a partnership and any partners distributive share thereof is determined and taxes interest or penalties attributable thereto are assessed and collected at the partnership level although it is uncertain how these new rules will be implemented it is possible that they could result in partnerships in which we directly or indirect invest being required to pay additional taxes interest and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment and we as a direct or indirect partner of these partnerships could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes interest and penalties even though we as a reit may not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporatelevel taxes had we owned the assets of the partnership directly the new partnership tax audit rules will apply to the operating partnership and its subsidiaries that are classified as partnerships for federal income tax purposes the changes created by these new rules are sweeping and in many respects dependent on the promulgation of future regulations or other guidance by the us department of the treasury or the treasury and accordingly there can be no assurance that these rules will not have a material adverse effect on us 

  legislative administrative regulatory or other actions affecting reits including positions taken by the irs could have a material adverse effect on us or our investors 

the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the treasury changes to the tax laws or interpretations thereof by the irs and the treasury with or without retroactive application could materially and adversely affect us or our investors new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify to be taxed as a reit andor the federal income tax consequences to us and our investors of such qualification 

risks relating to joint ventures 

  we have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance them 

as of december 31 2015 we owned interests in 94 incomeproducing properties with other parties of those 13 properties are included in our consolidated financial statements we account for the other 81 properties or the joint venture properties as well as our investment in klépierre and our joint ventures with seritage growth properties or seritage and hudsons bay company or hbc using the equity method of accounting we serve as general partner or property manager for 58 of these 81 properties however certain major decisions such as approving the operating budget and selling refinancing and redeveloping the properties require the consent of the other owners of the properties for which we do not serve as general partner or property manager 20 are in our international joint ventures the international properties are managed locally by joint ventures in which we share control of the properties with our partner the other owners have participating rights that we consider substantive for purposes of determining control over the properties assets the remaining joint venture properties klépierre a publicly traded parisbased real estate company and our joint venture with hbc are managed by third parties 

these investments and other future similar investments could involve risks that would not be present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or other owners might become bankrupt suffer a deterioration in their creditworthiness or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or other owners could have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our own business interests or goals and could be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives 

these investments and other future similar investments also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions such as a sale or financing because neither we nor our partner or other owner has full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or other owners might result in litigation or arbitration that could increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or other owners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we risk the possibility of being liable for the actions of our partners or other owners 

  the operating partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties 

joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property which is nonrecourse to us nevertheless the joint ventures failure to satisfy its debt obligations could result in the loss of our investment therein as of december 31 2015 the operating partnership guaranteed joint venture related mortgage indebtedness of 3537 million of which we have a right of recovery from our venture partners of 1128 million a default by a joint venture under its debt obligations may expose us to liability under a guaranty we may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests advances or partner loans although such fundings are not typically required contractually or otherwise 

risks relating to environmental matters 

  as owners of real estate we can face liabilities for environmental contamination 

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require us as a current or previous owner or operator of real property to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at a property or at impacted neighboring properties these laws often impose liability regardless of whether the property owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances these laws and regulations may require the abatement or removal of asbestos containing materials in the event of damage demolition or renovation reconstruction or expansion of a property and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air those laws and regulations also govern the installation maintenance and removal of underground storage tanks used to store waste oils or other petroleum products many of our properties contain or at one time contained asbestos containing materials or underground storage tanks primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment we may be subject to regulatory action and may also be held liable to third parties for personal injury or property damage incurred by the parties in connection with any such laws and regulations or hazardous or toxic substances the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances and related liabilities may be substantial and could materially and adversely affect us the presence of hazardous or toxic substances or the failure to remediate the related contamination may also adversely affect our ability to sell lease or redevelop a property or to borrow money using a property as collateral 

  our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful 

although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with federal state and local environmental laws and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances this belief is based on limited testing nearly all of our properties have been subjected to phase i or similar environmental audits these environmental audits have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us however we cannot assure you that 

• previous environmental studies with respect to the portfolio reveal all potential environmental liabilities • any previous owner occupant or tenant of a property did not create any material environmental condition not known to us • the current environmental condition of the portfolio will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by other unrelated third parties or • future uses or conditions including without limitation changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof will not result in environmental liabilities   we face possible risks associated with climate change 

we cannot determine with certainty whether global warming or cooling is occurring and if so at what rate to the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns our properties in certain markets could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sealevels over time these conditions could result in volatile or decreased demand for retail space at certain of our properties or in extreme cases our inability to operate the properties at all climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of or making unavailable insurance on favorable terms or at all and increasing the cost of energy and snow removal at our properties moreover compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change including compliance with green building codes may require us to make improvements to our existing properties or increase taxes and fees assessed on us or our properties at this time there can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on us 

other factors affecting our business 

  some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance 

we maintain insurance coverage with thirdparty carriers who provide a portion of the coverage for specific layers of potential losses including commercial general liability fire flood extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties in the united states the initial portion of coverage not provided by thirdparty carriers is either insured through our whollyowned captive insurance companies or other financial arrangements controlled by us a thirdparty carrier has in turn agreed if required to provide evidence of coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carriers policy a similar policy written through our captive insurance companies also provides initial coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal windstorm locations 

there are some types of losses including lease and other contract claims that generally are not insured or are subject to large insurance deductibles if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs or a loss for which a large deductible occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue it could generate but may remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligation related to the property 

we currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the united states on an all risk basis in the amount of up to 1 billion the current federal laws which provide this coverage are expected to operate through 2020 however the us government could in the future terminate its reinsurance of terrorism which would increase the risk of uninsured losses for terrorist acts despite the existence of this insurance coverage or actual or threatened terrorist attacks or other activity where we operate could materially and adversely affect us 

  we face risks associated with security breaches through cyberattacks cyber intrusions or otherwise as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology it networks and related systems 

we face risks associated with security breaches whether through cyberattacks or cyber intrusions over the internet malware computer viruses attachments to emails persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems the risk of a security breach or disruption particularly through cyberattack or cyber intrusion including by computer hackers foreign 

governments and cyber terrorists has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform daytoday operations including managing our building systems although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging even the most well protected information networks systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed not to be detected and in fact may not be detected accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk 

a breach or significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our systems including our primary website could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers tenants and revenues generate third party claims result in the unintended andor unauthorized public disclosure or the misappropriation of proprietary personal identifying and confidential information and require us to incur significant expenses to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues and we may not be able to recover these expenses in whole or in any part from our service providers or responsible parties or their or our insurers 

  our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain talented employees and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our business 

the success of our business depends in part on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees and our ability to attract retain and motivate talented employees could significantly impact our future performance competition for these individuals is intense and we cannot assure you that we will retain our key executive management team and employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on us 

  provisions in our charter and bylaws and in the operating partnerships partnership agreement could prevent a change of control 

our charter contains a general restriction on the accumulation of shares in excess of 8 of our capital stock the charter permits the members of the simon family and related persons to own up to 18 of our capital stock ownership is determined by the lower of the number of outstanding shares voting power or value controlled our board of directors may by majority vote permit exceptions to those levels in circumstances where our board of directors determines our ability to qualify as a reit will not be jeopardized these restrictions on ownership may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders other provisions of our charter and bylaws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control even if some stockholders deem such a change to be in their best interests these include provisions preventing holders of our common stock from acting by written consent and requiring that up to four directors in the aggregate may be elected by holders of class b common stock in addition certain provisions of the operating partnerships partnership agreement could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control these include a provision requiring the consent of a majority in interest of units in order for us as general partner of the operating partnership to among other matters engage in a merger transaction or sell all or substantially all of our assets

• base minimum rents • overage and percentage rents based on tenants sales volume and • recoverable expenditures such as property operating real estate taxes repair and maintenance and advertising and promotional expenditures revenues of our management company after intercompany eliminations consist primarily of management fees that are typically based upon the revenues of the property being managed 

we invest in real estate properties to maximize total financial return which includes both operating cash flows and capital appreciation we seek growth in earnings funds from operations or ffo and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments we seek to accomplish this growth through the following 

• attracting and retaining high quality tenants and utilizing economies of scale to reduce operating expenses • expanding and retenanting existing highly productive locations at competitive rental rates • selectively acquiring or increasing our interests in high quality real estate assets or portfolios of assets • generating consumer traffic in our retail properties through marketing initiatives and strategic corporate alliances and • selling selective noncore assets we also grow by generating supplemental revenue from the following activities 

• establishing our malls as leading market resource providers for retailers and other businesses and consumerfocused corporate alliances including payment systems such as handling fees relating to the sales of bankissued prepaid cards national marketing alliances static and digital media initiatives business development sponsorship and events • offering property operating services to our tenants and others including waste handling and facility services and the provision of energy services • selling or leasing land adjacent to our properties commonly referred to as outlots or outparcels and 48

we routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio our international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk 

to support our growth we employ a threefold capital strategy 

• provide the capital necessary to fund growth • maintain sufficient flexibility to access capital in many forms both public and private and • manage our overall financial structure in a fashion that preserves our investment grade credit ratings we consider ffo net operating income or noi and comparable property noi noi for properties owned and operated in both periods under comparison to be key measures of operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or gaap we use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure are included below in this discussion

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

• we as a lessor retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases we accrue minimum rents on a straightline basis over the terms of their respective leases substantially all of our retail tenants are also required to pay overage rents based on sales over a stated base amount during the lease year we recognize overage rents only when each tenants sales exceed its sales threshold • we review investment properties for impairment on a propertybyproperty basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable these circumstances include but are not limited to a decline in a propertys cash flows occupancy or comparable sales per square foot we measure any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization plus its residual value is less than the carrying value of the property to the extent impairment has occurred we charge to income the excess of carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value we may decide to sell properties that are held for use and the sale prices of these properties may differ from their carrying values we also review our investments including investments in unconsolidated entities if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the fair value of the investments below carrying value is otherthantemporary changes in economic and operating conditions that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other investments could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future charges to earnings if assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results • to maintain our status as a reit we must distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income in any given year and meet certain asset and income tests we monitor our business and transactions that may potentially impact our reit status in the unlikely event that we fail to maintain our reit status and available relief provisions do not apply we would be required to pay federal income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates during the period we did not qualify as a reit if we lost our reit status we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost unless our failure was due to reasonable cause and certain other conditions were met as a result failing to maintain reit status would result in a significant increase in the income tax expense recorded and paid during those periods 52 

• we make estimates as part of our valuation of the purchase price of acquisitions including the components of excess investment in joint ventures to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component the most significant components of our valuations are typically the determination of fair value to the buildings asifvacant land and market value of inplace leases in the case of the fair value of buildings and fair value of land and other intangibles our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term in the case of the market value of inplace leases we make our best estimates of the tenants ability to pay rents based upon the tenants operating performance at the property including the competitive position of the property in its market as well as sales psf rents psf and overall occupancy cost for the tenants in place at the acquisition date our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired inplace leases • a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon opening results of operations

liquidity and capital resources 

because we own longlived incomeproducing assets our financing strategy relies primarily on longterm fixed rate debt floating rate debt comprised only 94 of our total consolidated debt at december 31 2015 we also enter into interest rate protection agreements to manage our interest rate risk we derive most of our liquidity from positive net cash flow from operations and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities that totaled 38 billion in the aggregate during 2015 in addition the credit facility the operating partnerships 275 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility or supplemental facility and together with the credit facility the credit facilities and the commercial paper program provide alternative sources of liquidity as our cash needs vary from time to time borrowing capacity under these sources may be increased as discussed further below 

our balance of cash and cash equivalents increased 889 million during 2015 to 7011 million as of december 31 2015 as further discussed in cash flows below 

on december 31 2015 we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of approximately 46 billion under the credit facility and the supplemental facility net of outstanding borrowings of 12 billion and amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program and letters of credit of 369 million for the year ended december 31 2015 the maximum amount outstanding under the two credit facilities was 18 billion and the weighted average amount outstanding was 12 billion the weighted average interest rate was 079 for the year ended december 31 2015 further on october 6 2014 the operating partnership entered into the global commercial paper program and on march 2 2015 increased the maximum aggregate program size from 5000 million to 10 billion as further discussed below 

we have historically had access to public equity and long and shortterm unsecured debt markets and access to secured debt and private equity from institutional investors at the property level 

our business model and status as a reit require us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition development and redevelopment activity and to refinance maturing debt we may also from time to time access the equity capital markets to accomplish our business objectives we believe we have sufficient cash on hand and availability under the credit facility the supplemental facility and the commercial paper program to address our debt maturities and capital needs through 2016 

cash flows 

our net cash flow from operating activities and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities totaled 38 billion during 2015 in addition we had net proceeds from our debt financing and repayment activities including the 1210 million debt extinguishment charge of 12 billion in 2015 these activities are further discussed below under financing and debt during 2015 we also 

• funded the acquisition of two properties acquired the land and existing structure anchored to one of our wholly owned properties funded an additional equity stake in klépierre funded the acquisition of our joint venture interest in ten assets that are adjacent to our existing properties funded our portion of a joint venture development project and funded the purchase of a noncontrolling interest in a joint venture the aggregate cash portion of which was 14 billion • paid stockholder dividends and unitholder distributions totaling 22 billion • funded consolidated capital expenditures of 10 billion including development and other costs of 1388 million redevelopment and expansion costs of 6991 million and tenant costs and other operational capital expenditures of 1831 million • funded investments in unconsolidated entities of 3299 million • funded the repurchase of our common stock and the purchase of limited partner units of 5057 million and • received proceeds on the sale of marketable securities of 5040 million in general we anticipate that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating expenses monthly debt service recurring capital expenditures and dividends to stockholders necessary to maintain our reit qualification on a longterm basis in addition we expect to be able to generate or obtain capital for nonrecurring capital expenditures such as acquisitions major building redevelopments and expansions as well as for scheduled principal maturities on outstanding indebtedness from 

• excess cash generated from operating performance and working capital reserves • borrowings on our credit facilities and commercial paper program • additional secured or unsecured debt financing or • additional equity raised in the public or private markets we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2016 and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash these cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our retail tenants a significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds from the credit facilities and commercial paper program curtail planned capital expenditures or seek other additional sources of financing as discussed above

contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

in regards to longterm debt arrangements the following table summarizes the material aspects of these future obligations on our consolidated indebtedness as of december 31 2015 and subsequent years thereafter dollars in 

thousands assuming the obligations remain outstanding through initial maturities including applicable exercise of available extension options 



1 represents principal maturities only and therefore excludes net discounts of 104 2 variable rate interest payments are estimated based on the libor rate at december 31 2015 3 represents contractual commitments for capital projects and services at december 31 2015 our share of estimated 2016 development redevelopment and expansion activity is further discussed below under development activity 4 represents only the minimum noncancellable lease period excluding applicable lease extension and renewal options 

our offbalance sheet arrangements consist primarily of our investments in joint ventures which are common in the real estate industry and are described in note 7 to the notes to consolidated financial statements our joint ventures typically fund their cash needs through secured debt financings obtained by and in the name of the joint venture entity the joint venture debt is secured by a first mortgage is without recourse to the joint venture partners and does not represent a liability of the partners except to the extent the partners or their affiliates expressly guarantee the joint venture debt as of december 31 2015 the operating partnership guaranteed joint venture related mortgage indebtedness of 3537 million of which we have a right of recovery from our venture partners of 1128 million mortgages guaranteed by us are secured by the property of the joint venture which could be sold in order to satisfy the outstanding obligation and which has an estimated fair value in excess of the guaranteed amount we may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests advances or partner loans although such fundings are not required contractually or otherwise 

acquisitions and dispositions 

buysell marketing rights and other exit mechanisms are common in real estate partnership agreements most of our partners are institutional investors who have a history of direct investment in retail real estate we and our partners in our joint venture properties may initiate these provisions subject to any applicable lock up or similar restrictions if we determine it is in our stockholders best interests for us to purchase the joint venture interest and we believe we have adequate liquidity to execute the purchase without hindering our cash flows then we may initiate these provisions or elect to buy our partners interest if we decide to sell any of our joint venture interests we expect to use the net proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness or to reinvest in development redevelopment or expansion opportunities 

acquisitions on january 15 2015 we acquired a 100 interest in jersey gardens renamed the mills at jersey gardens in elizabeth new jersey and university park village in fort worth texas properties previously owned by glimcher realty trust for 6779 million of cash and the assumption of existing mortgage debt of 4050 million

development activity 

new domestic developments redevelopments and expansions during 2015 construction began on the following properties 

• a 355000 square foot outlet center located in columbus ohio which is scheduled to open in june 2016 we own a 50 noncontrolling interest in this project our estimated share of the cost of this project is 475 million • clarksburg premium outlets a 392000 square foot project located in clarksburg maryland which is scheduled to open in october 2016 we own a 66 noncontrolling interest in this project our estimated share of the cost of this project is 1248 million • the shops at clearfork a 545000 square foot project located in fort worth texas which is scheduled to open in february 2017 we own a 45 noncontrolling interest in this project our estimated share of the cost of this project is 1016 million during 2015 the following premium outlets opened

we routinely incur costs related to construction for significant redevelopment and expansion projects at our properties redevelopment and expansion projects including the addition of anchors and big box tenants are underway at 27 properties in the us 

summary of capital expenditures the following table summarizes total capital expenditures on consolidated properties on a cash basis in millions 



our share of the costs of all development and redevelopment projects currently under construction is approximately 21 billion we expect to fund these capital projects with cash flows from operations our estimated stabilized return on invested capital typically ranges between 812 for all of our new development expansion and redevelopment projects 

international development activity we typically reinvest net cash flow from our international joint ventures to fund future international development activity we believe this strategy mitigates some of the risk of our initial investment and our exposure to changes in foreign currencies we have also funded most of our foreign investments with local currencydenominated borrowings that act as a natural hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates our consolidated net income exposure to changes in the volatility of the euro yen won and other foreign currencies is not material we expect our share of international development costs for 2016 will be approximately 1600 million primarily funded through reinvested joint venture cash flow and construction loans 

the following table describes these new development and expansion projects as well as our share of the estimated total cost as of december 31 2015 in millions 



on january 20 2016 we announced a venture with ivanhoe cambridge to build a 428000 square foot enclosed outlet center in edmonton canada scheduled to open in the fall of 2017 we will have a 50 noncontrolling interest in this project

nongaap financial measures 

industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties in part based on performance measures such as ffo diluted ffo per share noi and comparable property noi we believe that these nongaap measures are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of reits and provide a relevant basis for comparison among reits we also use these measures internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio 

we determine ffo based on the definition set forth by the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit as consolidated net income computed in accordance with gaap 

• excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization • excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items and cumulative effects of accounting changes • excluding gains and losses from the sales or disposals of previously depreciated retail operating properties • excluding impairment charges of depreciable real estate • plus the allocable portion of ffo of unconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting based upon economic ownership interest and • all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with gaap we have adopted nareits clarification of the definition of ffo that requires us to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary cumulative effect of accounting changes or a gain or loss resulting from the sale or disposal of or any impairment charges related to previously depreciated operating properties 

we include in ffo gains and losses realized from the sale of land outlot buildings marketable and nonmarketable securities and investment holdings of nonretail real estate we also include in ffo the impact of foreign currency exchange gains and losses legal expenses transaction expenses and other items required by gaap 

you should understand that our computation of these nongaap measures might not be comparable to similar measures reported by other reits and that these nongaap measures 

• do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap • should not be considered as alternatives to consolidated net income determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of operating performance and • are not alternatives to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 63 

the following schedule reconciles total ffo to consolidated net income and diluted net income per share to diluted ffo per share 



a includes ffo of the operating partnership related to the washington prime properties net of transaction expenses of 1080 million and 3603 million for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively includes diluted ffo per share related to washington prime properties net of transaction expenses of 030 and 099 for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively includes diluted ffo allocable to common stockholders of 924 million and 3085 million for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively b includes ffo of the operating partnership related to a gain on sale of marketable securities of 802 million or 022 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2015 includes diluted ffo allocable to common stockholders of 686 million for the year ended december 31 2015 c includes ffo of the operating partnership related to a loss on extinguishment of debt of 1210 million and 1276 million for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively includes diluted ffo per share related to a loss on extinguishment of debt of 033 and 035 for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively includes diluted ffo allocable to common stockholders of 1036 million and 1091 million for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively 

the following schedule reconciles consolidated net income to noi and sets forth the computations of comparable property noi 



1 noi excluded from comparable property noi relates to washington prime properties international properties other retail properties tmlp properties any of our nonretail holdings and results of our corporate and management company operations noi of us malls premium outlets and the mills not owned and operated in both periods under comparison and excluded income noted in footnote 2 below 2 excludes lease termination income interest income land sale gains straight line rent abovebelow market rent adjustments and the impact of significant redevelopment activities 

item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk 

our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our longterm debt obligations we manage exposure to interest rate market risk through our risk management strategy by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of variable rate debt we are also exposed to foreign currency risk on financings of certain foreign operations our intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging these exposures we do not enter into either interest rate protection or foreign currency rate protection agreements for speculative purposes 

we may enter into treasury lock agreements as part of anticipated issuances of senior notes upon completion of the debt issuance the cost of these instruments is recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt agreement 

our future earnings cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest primarily libor which was at historically low levels during 2015 based upon consolidated indebtedness and interest rates at december 31 2015 a 50 basis point increase in the market rates of interest would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 105 million and would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately 5012 million

 item 9a controls and procedures 

as of december 31 2015 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act as a process designed by or under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

• pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and disposition of assets • provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and • provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework 2013 based on that assessment and criteria we believe that as of december 31 2015 our internal control over financial reporting was effective 

attestation report of the registered public accounting firm 

the audit report of ernst  young llp on their assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 is set forth within item 8 of this form 10k 

managements evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the exchange act that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the secs rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures because of inherent limitations disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2015 based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2015 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level 

as of march 31 2015 june 30 2015 and september 30 2015 

managements evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as part of our yearend reporting procedures and controls we identified a noncash gain of 2069 million solely relating to our equity method investment in klépierre sa klépierre and its acquisition of corio nv corio and issuance of shares to corio shareholders in january 2015 that should have been but was not recorded in the first quarter of 2015 notwithstanding this omission we did disclose the corio transaction in the footnotes to our 2015 first quarter 

financial statements including the dilution of our ownership interest in klépierre as a result of klépierres issuance of shares to corio shareholders the number of klépierre shares we owned and klépierres quoted market price per share at march 31 2015 klépierre is listed on euronext paris 

on january 13 2016 we amended our quarterly reports on form 10q for the quarters ended march 31 2015 june 30 2015 and september 30 2015 to record the 2069 million noncash gain in the interim financial statements contained therein in amending these quarterly reports we did not revise managements conclusions regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as stated in the originally filed quarterly reports 

this accounting error occurred due to a deficiency in our internal control over interim financial reporting — specifically a design defect in our internal control over interim financial reporting of equity method investees as a result of our not applying the guidance in asc32310401 when preparing our interim financial statements because of this deficiency which existed until the fourth quarter of 2015 any dilution in our ownership caused by the issuance of additional shares of capital stock by either of the two joint ventures accounted for under the equity method that have the ability to issue such shares which would result in the need to recognize a gain or loss due to the application of asc32310401 would not have been timely recorded in our interim financial statements as disclosure controls and procedures is defined to include those controls that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in exchange act reports is recorded within the time periods specified in the commissions rules and forms upon further consideration our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer reevaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of march 31 2015 june 30 2015 and september 30 2015 based on this reevaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have now concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of such dates were not effective at a reasonable assurance level 

the procedures performed by the company which identified the appropriate accounting for these transactions by our equity method investees were part of our yearend internal control procedures we have now implemented additional procedures as part of our quarterly internal control procedures as a result this deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting has been remediated and tested as of december 31 2015 

during the quarter ended december 31 2015 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

as discussed above during the quarter ended december 31 2015 we implemented procedures encompassing the guidance in asc32310401 as part of our quarterly internal control procedures

for a description of our operational strategies and developments in our business during 2014 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form 10k 

other policies 

the following is a discussion of our investment policies financing policies conflict of interest policies and policies with respect to certain other activities one or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote 

investment policies 

while we emphasize equity real estate investments we may also provide secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers however any of these investments would be subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for reit qualification these reit limitations mean that we cannot make an investment that would cause our real estate assets to be less than 75 of our total assets we must also derive at least 75 of our gross income directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including rents from real property dividends from other reits and in certain circumstances interest from certain types of temporary investments in addition we must also derive at least 95 of our gross income from such real property investments and from dividends interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing 

subject to reit limitations we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate such an investment would normally be in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties we may in the future acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies 

financing policies 

because our reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of our taxable income we regularly access the debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions develop and redevelop properties and refinance 

maturing debt we must comply with the covenants contained in our financing agreements that limit our ratio of debt to total assets or market value as defined for example the operating partnerships line of credit and the indentures for the operating partnerships debt securities contain covenants that restrict the total amount of debt of the operating partnership to 65 or 60 in relation to certain debt of total assets as defined under the related arrangement and secured debt to 50 of total assets in addition these agreements contain other covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios furthermore the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for our equity securities and the debt securities of the operating partnership we strive to maintain investment grade ratings at all times but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so in the future 

if our board of directors determines to seek additional capital we may raise such capital by offering equity or debt securities creating joint ventures with existing ownership interests in properties entering into joint venture arrangements for new development projects retaining cash flows or a combination of these methods if the board of directors determines to raise equity capital it may without stockholder approval issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock the board of directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate such securities may be senior to the outstanding classes of common stock such securities also may include additional classes of preferred stock which may be convertible into common stock existing stockholders have no preemptive right to purchase shares in any subsequent offering of our securities any such offering could dilute a stockholders investment in us 

we expect most future borrowings would be made through the operating partnership or its subsidiaries we might however incur borrowings that would be reloaned to the operating partnership borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings publicly and privately placed debt instruments or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties any such indebtedness may be secured or unsecured any such indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to the borrower or crosscollateralized with other debt or may be fully or partially guaranteed by the operating partnership although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends we currently have no expectation that we will regularly do so 

on april 7 2014 the operating partnership amended and extended its 40 billion unsecured revolving credit facility or credit facility the credit facilitys initial borrowing capacity of 40 billion may be increased to 50 billion during its term the initial maturity date of the credit facility was extended to june 30 2018 and can be extended for an additional year to june 30 2019 at our sole option the operating partnership also has an additional 20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility or supplemental facility which may be increased to 25 billion during its term the supplemental facility will initially mature on june 30 2016 and can be extended for an additional year at our sole option we issue debt securities through the operating partnership but we may issue our debt securities which may be convertible into capital stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase capital stock we also may sell or securitize our lease receivables 

on october 6 2014 the operating partnership established a global unsecured commercial paper note program or the commercial paper program under the terms of the program the operating partnership may issue unsecured commercial paper notes denominated in us dollars euros and other currencies up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 5000 million or the nonus dollar equivalent thereof notes issued in nonus currencies may be issued by one or more subsidiaries of the operating partnership and are guaranteed by the operating partnership our commercial paper program is supported by our credit facilities and if necessary or appropriate we may make one or more draws under the credit facilities to pay amounts outstanding from time to time on the commercial paper program 

we may also finance our business through the following 

• issuance of shares of common stock or preferred stock • issuance of additional units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership or units • issuance of preferred units of the operating partnership • issuance of other securities including unsecured notes and mortgage debt • draws on our credit facilities • borrowings under the commercial paper program or • sale or exchange of ownership interests in properties the operating partnership may also issue units to transferors of properties or other partnership interests which may permit the transferor to defer gain recognition for tax purposes 

we do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property mortgage financing instruments however usually limit additional indebtedness on such properties additionally our 

unsecured credit facilities unsecured note indentures and other contracts may limit our ability to borrow and contain limits on mortgage indebtedness we may incur 

typically we invest in or form special purpose entities to assist us in obtaining secured permanent financing at attractive terms permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage loan on a single property or on a group of properties and generally requires us to provide a mortgage lien on the property or properties in favor of an institutional third party as a joint venture with a third party or as a securitized financing for securitized financings we create special purpose entities to own the properties these special purpose entities which are common in the real estate industry are structured so that they would not be consolidated in a bankruptcy proceeding involving a parent company we decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives for accounting purposes we include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness 

conflict of interest policies 

we maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest we have adopted governance principles governing the function conduct selection orientation and duties of our board of directors and the company as well as written charters for each of the standing committees of the board of directors in addition we have a code of business conduct and ethics which applies to all of our officers directors and employees and those of our subsidiaries at least a majority of the members of our board of directors must qualify as independent under the listing standards of the new york stock exchange or nyse and cannot be affiliated with the simon family who are significant stockholders andor unitholders in the operating partnership in addition the audit and compensation committees of our board of directors are comprised of independent members who meet the additional independence requirements of the nyse any transaction between us and the simons including property acquisitions service and property management agreements and retail space leases must be approved by a majority of our independent directors

competition 

the retail industry is dynamic and competitive we compete with numerous merchandise distribution channels including malls outlet centers communitylifestyle centers and other shopping centers in the united states and abroad we also compete with internet retailing sites and catalogs which provide retailers with distribution options beyond existing brick and mortar retail properties the existence of competitive alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we can obtain this results in competition for both the tenants to occupy the properties that we develop and manage as well as for the acquisition of prime sites including land for development and operating properties we believe that there are numerous factors that make our properties highly desirable to retailers including 

• the quality location and diversity of our properties • our management and operational expertise 5 

• our extensive experience and relationships with retailers lenders and suppliers and • our mall marketing initiatives and consumer focused strategic corporate alliances certain activities

 item 1a risk factors 

  the following factors among others could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows and you should carefully consider them additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which are currently not believed to be material may also affect our actual results we may update these factors in our future periodic reports 

risks relating to debt and the financial markets 

  we have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations 

as of december 31 2014 our consolidated mortgages and unsecured indebtedness excluding related premium and discount totaled 208 billion we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the property such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants cause a reduction in the income from the property should such events occur our operations may be adversely affected if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value 

  disruption in the credit markets or downgrades in our credit ratings may adversely affect our ability to access external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements 

we depend on external financings principally debt financings to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt our access to financing depends on our credit rating the willingness of banks to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature or that the financing available to us will be on acceptable terms 

  adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

the operating partnerships outstanding senior unsecured notes the commercial paper program and simons preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and the economic outlook in general our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund our growth adverse changes in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our future growth 

  our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk 

we selectively manage our exposure to interest rate risk by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of our variable rate debt in addition we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and terms are appropriate our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful 

our use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs 

factors affecting real estate investments and operations 

  we face risks associated with the acquisition development redevelopment and expansion of properties 

we regularly acquire and develop new properties and expand and redevelop existing properties and these activities are subject to various risks we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition development or redevelopmentexpansion opportunities in addition newly acquired developed or redevelopedexpanded properties may not perform as well as 

expected we are subject to other risks in connection with any acquisition development and redevelopmentexpansion activities including the following 

• construction costs of a project may be higher than projected potentially making the project unfeasible or unprofitable • we may not be able to obtain financing or to refinance loans on favorable terms if at all • we may be unable to obtain zoning occupancy or other governmental approvals • occupancy rates and rents may not meet our projections and the project may not be profitable and • we may need the consent of third parties such as department stores anchor tenants mortgage lenders and joint venture partners and those consents may be withheld if a development or redevelopmentexpansion project is unsuccessful either because it is not meeting our expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project planning we could lose our investment in the project further if we guarantee the propertys financing our loss could exceed our investment in the project 

  real estate investments are relatively illiquid 

our properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets these investments are relatively illiquid as a result our ability to sell one or more of our properties or investments in real estate in response to any changes in economic or other conditions may be limited if we want to sell a property we cannot assure you that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or that the sales price of a property will exceed the cost of our investment 

  our international expansion may subject us to different or greater risk from those associated with our domestic operations 

as of december 31 2014 we held interests in joint venture properties that operate in austria italy japan malaysia mexico the netherlands south korea canada and the united kingdom we also have an equity stake in klépierre a publiclytraded european real estate company which operates in 13 countries in europe accordingly our operating results and the value of our international operations may be impacted by any unhedged movements in the foreign currencies in which those operations transact and in which our net investment in the foreign operation is held we may pursue additional expansion and development opportunities outside the united states international development and ownership activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our domestic properties and operations these risks include 

• adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies • changes in foreign political and economic environments regionally nationally and locally • challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws including corporate governance operations taxes and litigation • differing lending practices • differences in cultures • changes in applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect foreign operations • difficulties in managing international operations and • obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash our international activities represented approximately 90 of our net operating income or noi for the year ended december 31 2014 to the extent that we expand our international activities the above risks could increase in significance which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

environmental risks 

  as owners of real estate we can face liabilities for environmental contamination 

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require us as a current or previous owner or operator of real property to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at a property or at impacted neighboring properties these laws often impose liability regardless of whether the property owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic 

substances these laws and regulations may require the abatement or removal of asbestos containing materials in the event of damage demolition or renovation reconstruction or expansion of a property and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air those laws and regulations also govern the installation maintenance and removal of underground storage tanks used to store waste oils or other petroleum products many of our properties contain or at one time contained asbestos containing materials or underground storage tanks primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition but is not estimable the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may also adversely affect our ability to sell lease or redevelop a property or to borrow using a property as collateral 

  our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful 

although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances this belief is based on limited testing nearly all of our properties have been subjected to phase i or similar environmental audits these environmental audits have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition however we cannot assure you that 

• existing environmental studies with respect to the portfolio reveal all potential environmental liabilities • any previous owner occupant or tenant of a property did not create any material environmental condition not known to us • the current environmental condition of the portfolio will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by other unrelated third parties or • future uses or conditions including without limitation changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof will not result in environmental liabilities retail operations risks 

  overall economic conditions may adversely affect the general retail environment 

our concentration in the retail real estate market means that we are subject to the risks that affect the retail environment generally including the levels of consumer spending seasonality the willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers tenant bankruptcies changes in economic conditions increasing use of the internet by retailers and consumers consumer confidence casualties and other natural disasters and the potential for terrorist activities the economy and consumer spending appear to be recovering from the effects of the recent recession we derive our cash flow from operations primarily from retail tenants many of whom have been and continue to be under some degree of economic stress a significant deterioration in our cash flow from operations could require us to curtail planned capital expenditures or seek alternative sources of financing 

  we may not be able to lease newly developed properties and renew leases and relet space at existing properties 

we may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants or for rents that are consistent with our projections also when leases for our existing properties expire the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms to the extent that our leasing plans are not achieved our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures could be adversely affected changes in economic and operating conditions that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other assets could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future charges to earnings if assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results 

  some of our properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more of these anchor stores or major tenants 

our properties are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally recognized tenants the value of some of our properties could be materially adversely affected if these department stores or major tenants fail to comply with their contractual obligations or cease their operations 

for example among department stores and other large stores — often referred to as big box stores — corporate merger activity typically results in the closure of duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations further sustained 

adverse pressure on the results of our department stores and major tenants may have a similarly sustained adverse impact upon our own results certain department stores and other national retailers have experienced and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future given current macroeconomic uncertainty and lessthandesirable levels of consumer confidence considerable decreases in customer traffic in their retail stores increased competition from alternative retail options such as those accessible via the internet and other forms of pressure on their business models as pressure on these department stores and national retailers increases their ability to maintain their stores meet their obligations both to us and to their external lenders and suppliers withstand takeover attempts by investors or rivals or avoid bankruptcy andor liquidation may be impaired and result in closures of their stores other tenants may be entitled to modify the economic or other terms of their existing leases in the event of such closures the modification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and could decrease rents or expense recovery charges 

additionally department store or major tenant closures may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sales at our properties if the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to the closing of anchor stores or other national retailers adverse economic conditions or other reasons tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges in the event of any default by a tenant we may not be able to fully recover andor may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with such parties 

  we face potential adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies 

bankruptcy filings by retailers can occur regularly in the course of our operations we continually seek to release vacant spaces resulting from tenant terminations the bankruptcy of a tenant particularly an anchor tenant may make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the affected properties future tenant bankruptcies could adversely affect our properties or impact our ability to successfully execute our releasing strategy 

  we face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably 

our properties compete with other retail properties and other forms of retailing such as catalogs and ecommerce websites competition may come from malls outlet centers communitylifestyle centers and other shopping centers both existing as well as future development projects as well as catalogs and ecommerce the presence of competitive alternatives affects our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain new construction renovations and expansions at competing sites could also negatively affect our properties 

we also compete with other retail property developers to acquire prime development sites in addition we compete with other retail property companies for tenants and qualified management 

risks relating to joint venture properties and our investment in klépierre 

  we have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance them 

as of december 31 2014 we owned interests in 95 incomeproducing properties with other parties of those 13 properties are included in our consolidated financial statements we account for the other 82 properties or the joint venture properties as well as our investment in klépierre using the equity method of accounting we serve as general partner or property manager for 60 of these 82 properties however certain major decisions such as approving the operating budget and selling refinancing and redeveloping the properties require the consent of the other owners of the properties for which we do not serve as general partner or property manager 19 are in our international joint ventures the international properties are managed locally by joint ventures in which we share control of the properties with our partner the other owners have participating rights that we consider substantive for purposes of determining control over the properties assets the remaining joint venture properties and klépierre are managed by third parties these limitations may adversely affect our ability to sell refinance or otherwise operate these properties 

  the operating partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties 

joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property which is nonrecourse to us as of december 31 2014 the operating partnership guaranteed joint venture related mortgage indebtedness of 2235 million of which we have a right of recovery from our venture partners of 787 million a default by a joint venture under its debt obligations may expose us to liability under a guaranty we may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests advances or partner loans although such fundings are not typically required contractually or otherwise 

other factors affecting our business 

  some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance 

we maintain insurance coverage with third party carriers who provide a portion of the coverage for specific layers of potential losses including commercial general liability fire flood extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties in the united states the initial portion of coverage not provided by third party carriers is either insured through our whollyowned captive insurance companies or other financial arrangements controlled by us a third party carrier has in turn agreed to provide evidence of coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carriers policy a similar policy written through our captive insurance entities also provides initial coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal windstorm locations 

there are some types of losses including lease and other contract claims which generally are not insured if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue it could generate 

we currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the united states on an all risk basis in the amount of up to 1 billion the current federal laws which provide this coverage are expected to operate through 2020 despite the existence of this insurance coverage any threatened or actual terrorist attacks where we operate could adversely affect our property values revenues consumer traffic and tenant sales 

  we face risks associated with security breaches through cyberattacks cyber intrusions or otherwise as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology it networks and related systems 

we face risks associated with security breaches whether through cyberattacks or cyber intrusions over the internet malware computer viruses attachments to emails persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform daytoday operations and in some cases may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging even the most well protected information networks systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed not be detected and in fact may not be detected accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk 

  our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain talented employees and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our business 

the success of our business depends in part on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees and our ability to attract retain and motivate talented employees could significantly impact our future performance competition for these individuals is intense and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive management team and key employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

risks relating to income taxes 

  we have elected to be taxed as a reit in the united states and certain of our international operations currently receive favorable tax treatment 

we are subject to certain incomebased taxes both domestically and internationally and other taxes including state and local taxes franchise taxes and withholding taxes on dividends from certain of our international investments we currently receive favorable tax treatment in various domestic and international jurisdictions through tax rules and regulations or through international treaties should we no longer receive such benefits the amount of taxes we pay may increase 

in the us we have elected to be taxed as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code we believe we have been organized and operated in a manner which allows us to qualify for taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code we intend to continue to operate in this manner however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of 

stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the internal revenue code reit qualification is governed by highly technical and complex provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

if we fail to comply with those provisions we may be subject to monetary penalties or ultimately to possible disqualification as a reit if such events occurs and if available relief provisions do not apply 

• we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income • we will be subject to corporate level income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and • unless entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions we will also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost

we generate the majority of our revenues from leases with retail tenants including 

• base minimum rents • overage and percentage rents based on tenants sales volume and • recoverable expenditures such as property operating real estate taxes repair and maintenance and advertising and promotional expenditures revenues of our management company after intercompany eliminations consist primarily of management fees that are typically based upon the revenues of the property being managed 

we invest in real estate properties to maximize total financial return which includes both operating cash flows and capital appreciation we seek growth in earnings funds from operations or ffo and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments we seek to accomplish this growth through the following 

• attracting and retaining high quality tenants and utilizing economies of scale to reduce operating expenses • expanding and retenanting existing highly productive locations at competitive rental rates • selectively acquiring or increasing our interests in high quality real estate assets or portfolios of assets • generating consumer traffic in our retail properties through marketing initiatives and strategic corporate alliances and • selling selective noncore assets 43 

we also grow by generating supplemental revenue from the following activities 

• establishing our malls as leading market resource providers for retailers and other businesses and consumerfocused corporate alliances including payment systems such as handling fees relating to the sales of bankissued prepaid cards national marketing alliances static and digital media initiatives business development sponsorship and events • offering property operating services to our tenants and others including waste handling and facility services and the provision of energy services • selling or leasing land adjacent to our properties commonly referred to as outlots or outparcels and • generating interest income on cash deposits and investments in loans including those made to related entities we focus on high quality real estate across the retail real estate spectrum we expand or redevelop properties to enhance profitability and market share of existing assets when we believe the investment of our capital meets our riskreward criteria we selectively develop new properties in markets we believe are not adequately served by existing retail outlets 

we routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio our international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk 

to support our growth we employ a threefold capital strategy 

• provide the capital necessary to fund growth • maintain sufficient flexibility to access capital in many forms both public and private and • manage our overall financial structure in a fashion that preserves our investment grade credit ratings we consider ffo net operating income or noi and comparable property noi noi for properties owned and operating in both periods under comparison to be key measures of operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or gaap we use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure are included below in this discussion 

results overview 

diluted earnings per common share increased 028 during 2014 to 452 as compared to 424 in 2013 the increase in diluted earnings per share was primarily attributable to

our effective overall borrowing rate at december 31 2014 on our consolidated indebtedness decreased 39 basis points to 441 as compared to 480 at december 31 2013 this reduction was primarily due to a decrease in the effective overall borrowing rate on fixed rate debt of 38 basis points 472 at december 31 2014 as compared to 510 at december 31 2013 combined with a decrease in the effective overall borrowing rate on variable rate debt of 6 basis points 116 at december 31 2014 as compared to 122 at december 31 2013 at december 31 2014 the weighted average years to maturity of our consolidated indebtedness was 62 years as compared to 42 years at december 31 2013

united states portfolio data 

the portfolio data discussed in this overview includes the following key operating statistics ending occupancy average base minimum rent per square foot and total sales per square foot for our domestic assets we include acquired properties in this data beginning in the year of acquisition and remove disposed properties in the year of disposition the washington prime properties have been removed from the portfolio data for all periods presented for comparative purposes we separate the information related to the mills from our other us operations we also do not include any properties located outside of the united states 

the following table sets forth these key operating statistics for 

• properties that are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements • properties we account for under the equity method of accounting as joint ventures and • the foregoing two categories of properties on a total portfolio basis 



1 percentages may not recalculate due to rounding percentage and basis point changes are representative of the change from the comparable prior period 

ending occupancy levels and average base minimum rent per square foot ending occupancy is the percentage of gross leasable area or gla which is leased as of the last day of the reporting period we include all company owned space except for mall anchors mall majors mall freestanding and mall outlots in the calculation base minimum rent per square foot is the average base minimum rent charge in effect for the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in ending occupancy 

total sales per square foot total sales include total reported retail tenant sales on a trailing 12month basis at owned gla for mall stores with less than 10000 square feet in the malls and the mills and all reporting tenants at the premium outlets retail sales at owned gla affect revenue and profitability levels because sales determine the amount of minimum rent that can be charged the percentage rent realized and the recoverable expenses common area maintenance real estate taxes etc that tenants can afford to pay 

current leasing activities 

during 2014 we signed 773 new leases and 1581 renewal leases excluding mall anchors and majors new development redevelopment expansion downsizing and relocation with a fixed minimum rent across our us malls and premium outlets portfolio comprising approximately 74 million square feet of which 55 million square feet related to consolidated properties during 2013 we signed 950 new leases and 1391 renewal leases with a fixed minimum rent

international property data 

the following are selected key operating statistics for our premium outlets in japan the information used to prepare these statistics has been supplied by the managing venture partner 



critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

• we as a lessor retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases we accrue minimum rents on a straightline basis over the terms of their respective leases substantially all of our retail tenants are also required to pay overage rents based on sales over a stated base amount during the lease year we recognize overage rents only when each tenants sales exceed its sales threshold • we review investment properties for impairment on a propertybyproperty basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable these circumstances include but are not limited to a decline in a propertys cash flows occupancy or comparable sales per square foot we measure any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization plus its residual value is less than the carrying value of the property to the extent impairment has occurred we charge to income the excess of carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value we may decide to sell properties that are held for use and the sale prices of these properties may differ from their carrying values we also review our investments including investments in unconsolidated entities if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the fair value of the investments below carrying value is otherthantemporary changes in economic and operating conditions that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other investments could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future charges to earnings if assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results • to maintain our status as a reit we must distribute at least 90 of our taxable income in any given year and meet certain asset and income tests we monitor our business and transactions that may potentially impact our reit status in the unlikely event that we fail to maintain our reit status and available relief provisions do not apply then we would be required to pay federal income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates during the period we did not qualify as a reit if we lost our reit status we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost unless our failure was due to reasonable cause and certain other conditions were met as a result failing to maintain reit status would result in a significant increase in the income tax expense recorded and paid during those periods 47 

• we make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions including the components of excess investment in joint ventures to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component the most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to the buildings asifvacant land and market value of inplace leases in the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term in the case of the market value of inplace leases we make our best estimates of the tenants ability to pay rents based upon the tenants operating performance at the property including the competitive position of the property in its market as well as sales psf rents psf and overall occupancy cost for the tenants in place at the acquisition date our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired inplace leases • a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon opening results of operations

liquidity and capital resources 

because we own longlived incomeproducing assets our financing strategy relies primarily on longterm fixed rate debt floating rate debt currently comprises only 88 of our total consolidated debt at december 31 2014 we also enter into interest rate protection agreements to manage our interest rate risk we derive most of our liquidity from positive net cash flow from operations and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities that totaled 32 billion during 2014 in addition the credit facility the 20 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility or supplemental facility and the commercial paper program provide alternative sources of liquidity as our cash needs vary from time to time borrowing capacity under these credit facilities may be increased as discussed further below 

our balance of cash and cash equivalents from continuing operations decreased 11 billion during 2014 to 6123 million as of december 31 2014 as further discussed in cash flows below 

on december 31 2014 we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of approximately 50 billion under the two credit facilities net of outstanding borrowings of 5585 million and letters of credit of 389 million for the year ended december 31 2014 the maximum amount outstanding under the two credit facilities was 12 billion and the weighted average amount outstanding was 8554 million the weighted average interest rate was 099 for the year ended december 31 2014 further on october 6 2014 the operating partnership entered into a global commercial paper program as further discussed below 

we and the operating partnership have historically had access to public equity and long and shortterm unsecured debt markets and access to secured debt and private equity from institutional investors at the property level 

our business model and status as a reit requires us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition development and redevelopment activity and to refinance maturing debt we may also from time to time access the equity capital markets to accomplish our business objectives we believe we have sufficient cash on hand and availability under the credit facility the supplemental facility and the commercial paper program to address our debt maturities and capital needs through 2015 

cash flows 

our net cash flow from operating activities and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities totaled 32 billion during 2014 in addition we had net repayments from our debt financing and repayment activities including the 1276 million debt extinguishment charge of 18 billion in 2014 and net proceeds from debt financings related to the washington prime spinoff of 10 billion these activities are further discussed below under financing and debt or note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements during 2014 we or the operating partnership also 

• funded the acquisition of one of our partners remaining redeemable interests in a portfolio of ten properties acquired the remaining 50 ownership interest in arizona mills from our joint venture partner contributed funds into an existing partnership in exchange for a new series of preferred partnership units and acquired an undeveloped land parcel the aggregate cash portion of which was 2581 million • paid stockholder dividends and unitholder distributions totaling 19 billion • funded consolidated capital expenditures of 7967 million includes development and other costs of 516 million redevelopment and expansion costs of 5160 million and tenant costs and other operational capital expenditures of 2291 million • funded investments in unconsolidated entities of 2398 million and received repayments of construction loans to joint ventures of 1201 million net of funding and • purchased marketable and nonmarketable securities of 3912 million in general we anticipate that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating expenses monthly debt service recurring capital expenditures and dividends to stockholders necessary to maintain our reit qualification on a longterm basis in addition we expect to be able to generate or obtain capital for nonrecurring capital expenditures such 

as acquisitions major building redevelopments and expansions as well as for scheduled principal maturities on outstanding indebtedness from 

• excess cash generated from operating performance and working capital reserves • borrowings on our credit facilities and commercial paper program • additional secured or unsecured debt financing or • additional equity raised in the public or private markets we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2015 and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash these cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our retail tenants a significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds from our credit facilities curtail planned capital expenditures or seek other additional sources of financing as discussed above

summary of capital expenditures the following table summarizes total capital expenditures on consolidated properties on a cash basis in millions 



our share of the costs of all development and redevelopment projects currently under construction is approximately 21 billion we expect to fund these capital projects with cash flows from operations our estimated stabilized return on invested capital typically ranges between 812 for all of our new development expansion and redevelopment projects 

international development activity we typically reinvest net cash flow from our international joint ventures to fund future international development activity we believe this strategy mitigates some of the risk of our initial investment and our exposure to changes in foreign currencies we have also funded most of our foreign investments with local currencydenominated borrowings that act as a natural hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates we expect our share of international development costs for 2015 will be approximately 1180 million primarily funded through reinvested joint venture cash flow and construction loans

nongaap financial measures 

industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties in part based on performance measures such as ffo diluted ffo per share noi and comparable property noi we believe that these nongaap measures are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of reits and provide a relevant basis for comparison among reits we also use these measures internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio 

we determine ffo based on the definition set forth by the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit as consolidated net income computed in accordance with gaap 

• excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization • excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items and cumulative effects of accounting changes • excluding gains and losses from the sales or disposals of previously depreciated retail operating properties • excluding impairment charges of depreciable real estate • plus the allocable portion of ffo of unconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting based upon economic ownership interest and • all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with gaap we have adopted nareits clarification of the definition of ffo that requires us to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary cumulative effect of accounting changes or a gain or loss resulting from the sale or disposal of or any impairment charges related to previously depreciated operating properties 

we include in ffo gains and losses realized from the sale of land outlot buildings marketable and nonmarketable securities and investment holdings of nonretail real estate we also include in ffo the impact of foreign currency exchange gains and losses legal expenses transaction expenses and other items required by gaap 

you should understand that our computation of these nongaap measures might not be comparable to similar measures reported by other reits and that these nongaap measures 

• do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap • should not be considered as alternatives to consolidated net income determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of operating performance and • are not alternatives to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 58 

the following schedule reconciles total ffo to consolidated net income and diluted net income per share to diluted ffo per share 



a includes ffo of the operating partnership related to the washington prime properties net of transaction expenses of 1080 million 3603 million and 3501 million for the years ended december 31 2014 december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively includes diluted ffo per share related to washington prime properties net of transaction expenses of 030 099 and 097 for the years ended december 31 2014 december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively b ffo of the operating partnership includes a loss on extinguishment of debt of 1276 million or 035 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2014 

the following schedule reconciles consolidated net income to noi and sets forth the computations of comparable property noi 



1 noi excluded from comparable property noi relates to washington prime properties international properties other retail properties tmlp properties any of our nonretail holdings and results of our corporate and management company operations noi of us malls premium outlets and the mills not owned and operated in both periods under comparison and excluded income noted in footnote 2 below 2 excludes lease termination income interest income land sale gains straight line rent abovebelow market rent adjustments and the impact of significant redevelopment activities 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule 13a15f or 15d15f promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as a process designed by or under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

• pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and disposition of assets • provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and • provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework 2013 

based on that assessment we believe that as of december 31 2014 our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 

item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk 

our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our longterm debt obligations we manage exposure to interest rate market risk through our risk management strategy by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of variable rate debt we are also exposed to foreign currency risk on financings of certain foreign operations our intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging these exposures we do not enter into either interest rate protection or foreign currency rate protection agreements for speculative purposes 

we may enter into treasury lock agreements as part of anticipated issuances of senior notes upon completion of the debt issuance the cost of these instruments is recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt agreement 

our future earnings cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest primarily libor which was at historically low levels during 2014 based upon consolidated indebtedness and interest rates at december 31 2014 a 50 basis point increase in the market rates of interest would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 92 million and would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately 4740 million

other policies 

the following is a discussion of our investment policies financing policies conflict of interest policies and policies with respect to certain other activities one or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote 

investment policies 

while we emphasize equity real estate investments we may also provide secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers however any of these investments would be subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for reit qualification these reit limitations mean that we cannot make an investment that would cause our real estate assets to be less than 75 of our total assets we must also derive at least 75 of our gross income directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including rents from real property dividends from other reits and in certain circumstances interest from certain types of temporary investments in addition we must also derive at least 95 of our gross income from such real property investments and from dividends interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing 

subject to reit limitations we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate such an investment would normally be in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties we may in the future acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies 

financing policies 

because our reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of our taxable income we regularly access the debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions develop and redevelop properties and refinance maturing debt we must comply with the covenants contained in our financing agreements that limit our ratio of debt to total assets or market value as defined for example the operating partnerships line of credit and the indentures for the operating partnerships debt securities contain covenants that restrict the total amount of debt of the operating partnership to 65 or 60 in relation to certain debt of total assets as defined under the related arrangement and secured debt to 50 of total assets in addition these agreements contain other covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios furthermore the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for our equity securities and the debt securities of the operating partnership we strive to maintain investment grade ratings at all times but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so in the future 

if our board of directors determines to seek additional capital we may raise such capital by offering equity or debt securities creating joint ventures with existing ownership interests in properties entering into joint venture arrangements for new development projects retaining cash flows or a combination of these methods if the board of directors determines to raise equity capital it may without stockholder approval issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock the board of directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate such securities may be senior to the outstanding classes of common stock such securities also may include additional classes of preferred stock which may be convertible into common stock existing stockholders have no preemptive right to purchase shares in any subsequent offering of our securities any such offering could dilute a stockholders investment in us 

we expect most future borrowings would be made through the operating partnership or its subsidiaries we might however incur borrowings that would be reloaned to the operating partnership borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings publicly and privately placed debt instruments or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties any such indebtedness may be secured or unsecured any such indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to the borrower or crosscollateralized with other debt or may be fully or partially guaranteed by the operating partnership although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends we currently have no expectation that we will regularly do so 

the operating partnership has an unsecured revolving credit facility or credit facility the credit facilitys initial borrowing capacity of 40 billion can be increased at our sole option to 50 billion during its term the credit facility will initially mature on october 30 2015 and can be extended for an additional year at our sole option we also have an additional unsecured revolving credit facility or supplemental facility with an initial borrowing capacity of 20 billion which can be increased at our sole option to 25 billion during its term the supplemental facility will initially mature on june 30 2016 and can be extended for an additional year at our sole option we issue debt securities through the operating partnership but we may issue our debt securities which may be convertible into capital stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase capital stock we also may sell or securitize our lease receivables 

we may also finance acquisitions through the following 

• issuance of shares of common stock or preferred stock • issuance of additional units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership or units • issuance of preferred units of the operating partnership • issuance of other securities including unsecured notes and mortgage debt • draws on our credit facilities or • sale or exchange of ownership interests in properties 4 

the operating partnership may also issue units to transferors of properties or other partnership interests which may permit the transferor to defer gain recognition for tax purposes 

we do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property mortgage financing instruments however usually limit additional indebtedness on such properties additionally our unsecured credit facilities unsecured note indentures and other contracts may limit our ability to borrow and contain limits on mortgage indebtedness we may incur 

typically we invest in or form special purpose entities to assist us in obtaining secured permanent financing at attractive terms permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage loan on a single property or on a group of properties and generally requires us to provide a mortgage lien on the property or properties in favor of an institutional third party as a joint venture with a third party or as a securitized financing for securitized financings we create special purpose entities to own the properties these special purpose entities which are common in the real estate industry are structured so that they would not be consolidated in a bankruptcy proceeding involving a parent company we decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives for accounting purposes we include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness 

conflict of interest policies 

we maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest we have adopted governance principles governing the function conduct selection orientation and duties of our board of directors and the company as well as written charters for each of the standing committees of the board of directors in addition we have a code of business conduct and ethics which applies to all of our officers directors and employees and those of our subsidiaries at least a majority of the members of our board of directors must qualify as independent under the listing standards of the new york stock exchange or nyse and cannot be affiliated with the simon family who are significant stockholders andor unitholders in the operating partnership in addition the audit and compensation committees of our board of directors are comprised of independent members who meet the additional independence requirements of the nyse any transaction between us and the simons including property acquisitions service and property management agreements and retail space leases must be approved by a majority of our independent directors 

the sale by the operating partnership of any property that it owns may have an adverse tax impact on the simons andor other limited partners of the operating partnership in order to avoid any conflict of interest between simon property and the simons our charter requires that at least six of our independent directors must authorize and require the operating partnership to sell any property it owns any such sale is subject to applicable agreements with third parties noncompetition agreements executed by herbert simon and david simon contain covenants limiting their ability to participate in certain shopping center activities 

policies with respect to certain other activities 

we intend to make investments which are consistent with our qualification as a reit unless the board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to so qualify as a reit the board of directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the reit requirements we have authority to offer shares of our capital stock or other securities in exchange for property we also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities we may issue shares of our common stock or cash at our option to holders of units in future periods upon exercise of such holders rights under the operating partnership agreement our policy prohibits us from making any loans to our directors or executive officers for any purpose we may make loans to the joint ventures in which we participate additionally we may make or buy interests in loans for real estate properties owned by others 

competition 

the retail industry is dynamic and competitive we compete with numerous merchandise distribution channels including malls outlet centers communitylifestyle centers and other shopping centers in the united states and abroad we also compete with internet retailing sites and catalogs which provide retailers with distribution options beyond existing brick and mortar retail properties the existence of competitive alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we can obtain this results in competition for both the tenants to occupy 

the properties that we develop and manage as well as for the acquisition of prime sites including land for development and operating properties we believe that there are numerous factors that make our properties highly desirable to retailers including 

• the quality location and diversity of our properties • our management and operational expertise • our extensive experience and relationships with retailers and lenders and • our mall marketing initiatives and consumer focused strategic corporate alliances certain activities 

during the past three years we have 

• issued 7975779 shares of common stock upon the exchange of 8628404 units of the operating partnership • issued 338074 restricted shares of common stock and 1960333 longterm incentive performance units or ltip units net of forfeitures under the simon property group 1998 stock incentive plan or the 1998 plan • redeemed 2000000 units for 12400 per unit in cash • issued 278763 units in exchange for the acquisition of a 100 interest in two outlet properties • issued 250030 shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options under the 1998 plan net of 76969 shares used to fund withholding tax • issued 9137500 shares of common stock in a public offering at a public offering price of 13700 per share • entered into the credit facility in october 2011 which provides an initial borrowing capacity of 40 billion and can be increased at our sole option to 50 billion during its term • entered into the supplemental facility in june 2012 which provides an initial borrowing capacity of 20 billion and can be increased at our sole option to 25 billion during its term • borrowed a maximum amount of 31 billion under the credit facilities the outstanding amount of borrowings under the credit facilities as of december 31 2013 was 12 billion of which 6601 million was related to us dollar equivalent of eurodenominated borrowings and 2122 million was related to us dollar equivalent of yendenominated borrowings • issued €7500 million 10 billion usd equivalent of unsecured notes on october 2 2013 at a fixed interest rate of 2375 with a maturity date of october 2 2020 and • provided annual reports containing financial statements audited by our independent registered public accounting firm and quarterly reports containing unaudited financial statements to our security holders employees

 item 1a risk factors 

  the following factors among others could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows and you should carefully consider them additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which are currently not believed to be material may also affect our actual results we may update these factors in our future periodic reports 

risks relating to debt and the financial markets 

  we have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations 

as of december 31 2013 our consolidated mortgages and unsecured indebtedness excluding related premium and discount totaled 236 billion we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the property such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants cause a reduction in the income from the property should such events occur our operations may be adversely affected if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value 

  disruption in the credit markets or downgrades in our credit ratings may adversely affect our ability to access external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements 

we depend on external financings principally debt financings to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt our access to financing depends on our credit rating the willingness of banks to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature or that the financing available to us will be on acceptable terms 

  adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

our outstanding senior unsecured notes and preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and the economic outlook in general our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund our growth adverse changes in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our future growth 

  our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk 

we selectively manage our exposure to interest rate risk by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of our variable rate debt in addition we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and terms are appropriate our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful 

our use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs 

factors affecting real estate investments and operations 

  we face risks associated with the acquisition development redevelopment and expansion of properties 

we regularly acquire and develop new properties and expand and redevelop existing properties and these activities are subject to various risks we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition development or redevelopmentexpansion opportunities in addition newly acquired developed or redevelopedexpanded properties may not perform as 

well as expected we are subject to other risks in connection with any acquisition development and redevelopmentexpansion activities including the following 

• construction costs of a project may be higher than projected potentially making the project unfeasible or unprofitable • we may not be able to obtain financing or to refinance loans on favorable terms if at all • we may be unable to obtain zoning occupancy or other governmental approvals • occupancy rates and rents may not meet our projections and the project may not be profitable and • we may need the consent of third parties such as department stores anchor tenants mortgage lenders and joint venture partners and those consents may be withheld if a development or redevelopmentexpansion project is unsuccessful either because it is not meeting our expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project planning we could lose our investment in the project further if we guarantee the propertys financing our loss could exceed our investment in the project 

  real estate investments are relatively illiquid 

our properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets these investments are relatively illiquid as a result our ability to sell one or more of our properties or investments in real estate in response to any changes in economic or other conditions may be limited if we want to sell a property we cannot assure you that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or that the sales price of a property will exceed the cost of our investment 

  our international expansion may subject us to different or greater risk from those associated with our domestic operations 

as of december 31 2013 we held interests in joint venture properties that operate in austria italy japan malaysia mexico the netherlands south korea canada and the united kingdom we also have an equity stake in klépierre a publiclytraded european real estate company accordingly our operating results and the value of our international operations may be impacted by any unhedged movements in the foreign currencies in which those operations transact and in which our net investment in the foreign operation is held we may pursue additional expansion and development opportunities outside the united states international development and ownership activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our domestic properties and operations these risks include 

• adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies • changes in foreign political and economic environments regionally nationally and locally • challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws including corporate governance operations taxes and litigation • differing lending practices • differences in cultures • changes in applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect foreign operations • difficulties in managing international operations and • obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash although our international activities currently are a relatively small portion of our business international properties represented approximately 84 of net operating income or noi for the year ended december 31 2013 to the extent that we expand our international activities these risks could increase in significance which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

environmental risks 

  as owners of real estate we can face liabilities for environmental contamination 

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require us as a current or previous owner or operator of real property to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or 

petroleum product releases at a property or at impacted neighboring properties these laws often impose liability regardless of whether the property owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances these laws and regulations may require the abatement or removal of asbestos containing materials in the event of damage demolition or renovation reconstruction or expansion of a property and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air those laws and regulations also govern the installation maintenance and removal of underground storage tanks used to store waste oils or other petroleum products many of our properties contain or at one time contained asbestos containing materials or underground storage tanks primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition but is not estimable the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may also adversely affect our ability to sell lease or redevelop a property or to borrow using a property as collateral 

  our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful 

although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances this belief is based on limited testing nearly all of our properties have been subjected to phase i or similar environmental audits these environmental audits have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition however we cannot assure you that 

• existing environmental studies with respect to the portfolio reveal all potential environmental liabilities • any previous owner occupant or tenant of a property did not create any material environmental condition not known to us • the current environmental condition of the portfolio will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by other unrelated third parties or • future uses or conditions including without limitation changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof will not result in environmental liabilities retail operations risks 

  overall economic conditions may adversely affect the general retail environment 

our concentration in the retail real estate market means that we are subject to the risks that affect the retail environment generally including the levels of consumer spending seasonality the willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers tenant bankruptcies changes in economic conditions increasing use of the internet by retailers and consumers consumer confidence casualties and other natural disasters and the potential for terrorist activities the economy and consumer spending appear to be recovering from the effects of the recent recession we derive our cash flow from operations primarily from retail tenants many of whom have been and continue to be under some degree of economic stress a significant deterioration in our cash flow from operations could require us to curtail planned capital expenditures or seek alternative sources of financing 

  we may not be able to lease newly developed properties and renew leases and relet space at existing properties 

we may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants or for rents that are consistent with our projections also when leases for our existing properties expire the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms to the extent that our leasing plans are not achieved our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures could be adversely affected changes in economic and operating conditions that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other assets could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future charges to earnings if assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results 

  some of our properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more of these anchor stores or major tenants 

our properties are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally recognized tenants the value of some of our properties could be materially adversely affected if these department stores or major tenants fail to comply with their contractual obligations or cease their operations 

for example among department stores and other large stores — often referred to as big box stores — corporate merger activity typically results in the closure of duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations further sustained adverse pressure on the results of our department stores and major tenants may have a similarly sustained adverse impact upon our own results certain department stores and other national retailers have experienced and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future given current macroeconomic uncertainty and lessthandesirable levels of consumer confidence considerable decreases in customer traffic in their retail stores increased competition from alternative retail options such as those accessible via the internet and other forms of pressure on their business models as pressure on these department stores and national retailers increases their ability to maintain their stores meet their obligations both to us and to their external lenders and suppliers withstand takeover attempts by investors or rivals or avoid bankruptcy andor liquidation may be impaired and result in closures of their stores other tenants may be entitled to modify the economic or other terms of their existing leases in the event of such closures the modification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and could decrease rents or expense recovery charges 

additionally department store or major tenant closures may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sales at our properties if the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to the closing of anchor stores or other national retailers adverse economic conditions or other reasons tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges in the event of any default by a tenant we may not be able to fully recover andor may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with such parties 

  we face potential adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies 

bankruptcy filings by retailers occur regularly in the course of our operations we continually seek to release vacant spaces resulting from tenant terminations the bankruptcy of a tenant particularly an anchor tenant may make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the affected properties future tenant bankruptcies could adversely affect our properties or impact our ability to successfully execute our releasing strategy 

  we face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably 

our properties compete with other retail properties and other forms of retailing such as catalogs and ecommerce websites competition may come from malls outlet centers communitylifestyle centers and other shopping centers both existing as well as future development projects as well as catalogs and ecommerce the presence of competitive alternatives affects our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain new construction renovations and expansions at competing sites could also negatively affect our properties 

we also compete with other retail property developers to acquire prime development sites in addition we compete with other retail property companies for tenants and qualified management 

risks relating to joint venture properties and our investment in klépierre 

  we have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance them 

as of december 31 2013 we owned interests in 111 incomeproducing properties with other parties of those 18 properties are included in our consolidated financial statements we account for the other 93 properties or the joint venture properties as well as our investment in klépierre using the equity method of accounting we serve as general partner or property manager for 70 of these 93 properties however certain major decisions such as approving the operating budget and selling refinancing and redeveloping the properties require the consent of the other owners of the properties for which we do not serve as general partner or property manager 20 are in our international joint ventures the international properties are managed locally by joint ventures in which we share control of the properties with our partner the other owners have participating rights that we consider substantive for purposes of determining control over the properties assets the remaining joint venture properties and klépierre are managed by third parties these limitations may adversely affect our ability to sell refinance or otherwise operate these properties 

  the operating partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties 

joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property which is nonrecourse to us as of december 31 2013 the operating partnership guaranteed joint venture related mortgage indebtedness of 1908 million of which we have a right of recovery from our venture partners of 

830 million a default by a joint venture under its debt obligations may expose us to liability under a guaranty or letter of credit we may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests advances or partner loans although such fundings are not typically required contractually or otherwise 

other factors affecting our business 

  some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance 

we maintain insurance coverage with third party carriers who provide a portion of the coverage for specific layers of potential losses including commercial general liability fire flood extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties in the united states the initial portion of coverage not provided by third party carriers is either insured through our whollyowned captive insurance companies or other financial arrangements controlled by us a third party carrier has in turn agreed to provide evidence of coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carriers policy a similar policy written through our captive insurance entities also provides initial coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal windstorm locations 

there are some types of losses including lease and other contract claims which generally are not insured if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue it could generate 

we currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the united states on an all risk basis in the amount of up to 1 billion the current federal laws which provide this coverage are expected to operate through 2014 despite the existence of this insurance coverage any threatened or actual terrorist attacks where we operate could adversely affect our property values revenues consumer traffic and tenant sales 

risks relating to income taxes 

  we have elected to be taxed as a reit in the united states and certain of our international operations currently receive favorable tax treatment 

we are subject to certain incomebased taxes both domestically and internationally and other taxes including state and local taxes franchise taxes and withholding taxes on dividends from certain of our international investments we currently receive favorable tax treatment in various domestic and international jurisdictions through tax rules and regulations or through international treaties should we no longer receive such benefits the amount of taxes we pay may increase 

in the us we have elected to be taxed as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code we believe we have been organized and operated in a manner which allows us to qualify for taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code we intend to continue to operate in this manner however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the internal revenue code reit qualification is governed by highly technical and complex provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

if we fail to comply with those provisions we may be subject to monetary penalties or ultimately to possible disqualification as a reit if such events occurs and if available relief provisions do not apply 

• we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income • we will be subject to corporate level income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and • unless entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions we will also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost

united states portfolio data 

the portfolio data discussed in this overview includes the following key operating statistics ending occupancy average base minimum rent per square foot and total sales per square foot for our domestic assets we include acquired properties in this data beginning in the year of acquisition and remove disposed properties in the year of disposition for comparative purposes we separate the information related to communitylifestyle centers and the mills from our other us operations we also do not include any properties located outside of the united states 

the following table sets forth these key operating statistics for 

• properties that are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements • properties we account for under the equity method of accounting as joint ventures and • the foregoing two categories of properties on a total portfolio basis

ending occupancy levels and average base minimum rent per square foot ending occupancy is the percentage of gross leasable area or gla which is leased as of the last day of the reporting period we include all company owned space except for mall anchors mall majors mall freestanding and mall outlots in the calculation base minimum rent per square foot is the average base minimum rent charge in effect for the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in ending occupancy 

total sales per square foot total sales include total reported retail tenant sales on a trailing 12month basis at owned gla for mall stores with less than 10000 square feet in the malls and all reporting tenants at the premium outlets and the mills retail sales at owned gla affect revenue and profitability levels because sales determine the amount of minimum rent that can be charged the percentage rent realized and the recoverable expenses common area maintenance real estate taxes etc that tenants can afford to pay

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

• we as a lessor retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases we accrue minimum rents on a straightline basis over the terms of their respective leases substantially all of our retail tenants are also required to pay overage rents based on sales over a stated base amount during the lease year we recognize overage rents only when each tenants sales exceed its sales threshold • we review investment properties for impairment on a propertybyproperty basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable these circumstances include but are not limited to a decline in a propertys cash flows occupancy or comparable sales per square foot we measure any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization plus its residual value is less than the carrying value of the property to the extent impairment has occurred we charge to income the excess of carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value we may decide to sell properties that are held for use and the sale prices of these properties may differ from their carrying values we also review our investments including investments in unconsolidated entities if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the fair value of the investments below carrying value is otherthantemporary changes in economic and operating conditions that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other investments could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future charges to earnings if assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results • to maintain our status as a reit we must distribute at least 90 of our taxable income in any given year and meet certain asset and income tests we monitor our business and transactions that may potentially impact our reit status in the unlikely event that we fail to maintain our reit status and available relief provisions do not apply then we would be required to pay federal income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates during the period we did not qualify as a reit if we lost our reit status we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four years unless our failure was due to reasonable cause and certain other conditions were met as a result failing to maintain reit status would result in a significant increase in the income tax expense recorded and paid during those periods • we make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component the most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to the buildings asifvacant land and market value of inplace leases in the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term in the case of the market value of inplace leases we make our best estimates of the tenants ability to pay rents based upon the tenants operating performance at the property including the competitive position of the property in its market as well as sales psf rents psf and overall occupancy cost for the tenants in place at the acquisition date our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired inplace leases • a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a 51 

development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon opening

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 640 million primarily due to an increase in the income of the operating partnership 

liquidity and capital resources 

because we own longlived incomeproducing assets our financing strategy relies primarily on longterm fixed rate debt we minimize the use of floating rate debt and may enter into floating rate to fixed rate interest rate swaps floating rate debt comprised only 75 of our total consolidated debt at december 31 2013 we also enter into interest rate protection agreements to manage our interest rate risk we derive most of our liquidity from positive net cash flow from operations and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities that totaled 34 billion during 2013 in addition the credit facility and the 20 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility or supplemental facility provide alternative sources of liquidity as our cash needs vary from time to time borrowing capacity under each of these facilities can be increased at our sole option as discussed further below 

our balance of cash and cash equivalents increased 5323 million during 2013 to 17 billion as of december 31 2013 as further discussed in cash flows below 

on december 31 2013 we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of 48 billion under the two facilities net of outstanding borrowings of 12 billion and letters of credit of 419 million for the year ended december 31 2013 the maximum amount outstanding under the two facilities was 16 billion and the weighted average amount outstanding was 13 billion the weighted average interest rate was 105 for the year ended december 31 2013 

we and the operating partnership have historically had access to public equity and long term unsecured debt markets and access to secured debt and private equity from institutional investors at the property level 

our business model and status as a reit requires us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition development and redevelopment activity and to refinance maturing debt we may also from time to time access the equity capital markets to accomplish our business objectives we believe we have sufficient cash on hand and availability under the credit facility and the supplemental facility to address our debt maturities and capital needs through 2014 

cash flows 

our net cash flow from operating activities and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities totaled 34 billion during 2013 which includes distributions of 3580 million for our share of excess proceeds from the refinancing of two joint venture properties in addition we had net proceeds from our debt financing and repayment activities of 4732 million in 2013 these activities are further discussed below under financing and debt during 2013 we or the operating partnership also 

• funded the acquisition of an outlet center deposits for the acquisition of an undeveloped land parcel a longterm ground lease buyout and an ownership interest in a european property management and development company and related outlet operating properties for 8665 million • received proceeds of 2741 million from the sale of two malls seven communitylifestyle centers and two other retail properties • paid stockholder dividends and unitholder distributions totaling 17 billion • funded consolidated capital expenditures of 8412 million includes development and other costs of 427 million redevelopment and expansion costs of 5535 million and tenant costs and other operational capital expenditures of 2450 million and • funded investments in unconsolidated entities of 1431 million and construction loans to joint ventures of 991 million in general we anticipate that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating expenses monthly debt service recurring capital expenditures and dividends to stockholders necessary to maintain our reit qualification on a longterm basis in addition we expect to be able to generate or obtain capital for nonrecurring capital expenditures such as acquisitions major building redevelopments and expansions as well as for scheduled principal maturities on outstanding indebtedness from 

• excess cash generated from operating performance and working capital reserves • borrowings on our credit facilities • additional secured or unsecured debt financing or • additional equity raised in the public or private markets we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2014 and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash these cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our retail tenants a significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds from our credit facilities curtail planned capital expenditures or seek other additional sources of financing as discussed above

in november 2013 one of our joint venture properties refinanced its 4300 million mortgage maturing december 11 2017 with a 12 billion mortgage that matures december 1 2020 the fixed interest rate was reduced from 591 to 375 as a result of this transaction and an extinguishment charge of 828 million was incurred 

covenants 

our unsecured debt agreements contain financial covenants and other nonfinancial covenants if we were to fail to comply with these covenants after the expiration of the applicable cure periods the debt maturity could be accelerated or other remedies could be sought by the lender including adjustments to the applicable interest rate as of december 31 2013 we are in compliance with all covenants of our unsecured debt 

at december 31 2013 we or our subsidiaries were the borrowers under 80 nonrecourse mortgage notes secured by mortgages on 80 properties including seven separate pools of crossdefaulted and crosscollateralized mortgages encumbering a total of 27 properties under these crossdefault provisions a default under any mortgage included in the crossdefaulted pool may constitute a default under all mortgages within that pool and may lead to acceleration of the indebtedness due on each property within the pool certain of our secured debt instruments contain financial and other nonfinancial covenants which are specific to the properties which serve as collateral for that debt if the borrower fails to comply with these covenants the lender could accelerate the debt and enforce its right against their collateral at december 31 2013 the applicable borrowers under these nonrecourse mortgage notes were in compliance with all covenants where noncompliance could individually or giving effect to applicable crossdefault provisions in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

summary of financing 

our consolidated debt adjusted to reflect outstanding derivative instruments and the effective weighted average interest rates as of december 31 2013 and 2012 consisted of the following dollars in thousands 



contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

in regards to longterm debt arrangements the following table summarizes the material aspects of these future obligations on our consolidated indebtedness as of december 31 2013 and subsequent years thereafter dollars in thousands assuming the obligations remain outstanding through initial maturities including applicable exercise of available extension options 



1 represents principal maturities only and therefore excludes net premiums of 25449 2 variable rate interest payments are estimated based on the libor rate at december 31 2013 3 represents contractual commitments for capital projects and services at december 31 2013 our share of estimated 2014 development redevelopment and expansion activity is further discussed below in the development activity section 4 represents only the minimum noncancellable lease period excluding applicable lease extension and renewal options 

certain of our consolidated properties have redemption features whereby the remaining interest in a property or portfolio of properties can be redeemed at the option of the holder or in circumstances that may be outside our control these amounts are accounted for as temporary equity within limited partners preferred interest in the operating partnership and noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and totaled 1649 million at december 31 2013 

our offbalance sheet arrangements consist primarily of our investments in joint ventures which are common in the real estate industry and are described in note 7 to the notes to consolidated financial statements our joint ventures typically fund their cash needs through secured debt financings obtained by and in the name of the joint venture entity the joint venture debt is secured by a first mortgage is without recourse to the joint venture partners and does not represent a liability of the partners except to the extent the partners or their affiliates expressly guarantee the joint venture debt as of december 31 2013 the operating partnership guaranteed joint venture related mortgage indebtedness of 1908 million of which we have a right of recovery from our venture partners of 830 million mortgages guaranteed by us are secured by the property of the joint venture which could be sold in order to satisfy the outstanding obligation and which has an estimated fair value in excess of the guaranteed amount we may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests advances or partner loans although such fundings are not required contractually or otherwise 

acquisitions and dispositions 

buysell marketing rights and other exit mechanisms are common in real estate partnership agreements most of our partners are institutional investors who have a history of direct investment in retail real estate we and our partners in our joint venture properties may initiate these provisions subject to any applicable lock up or similar restrictions if we determine it is in our stockholders best interests for us to purchase the joint venture interest and we believe we have adequate liquidity to execute the purchase without hindering our cash flows then we may initiate these provisions or elect to buy our partners interest if we decide to sell any of our joint venture interests we expect to use the net proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness or to reinvest in development redevelopment or expansion opportunities 

acquisitions on january 10 2014 we acquired one of our partners remaining redeemable interests in a portfolio of ten properties for approximately 1133 million subject to a preexisting contractual arrangement the amount paid to acquire the interests in the seven properties which were previously consolidated is included in limited partners preferred interest in the operating partnership and noncontrolling redeemable interest in properties in the accompanying december 31 2013 consolidated balance sheet 

during the second quarter of 2013 we signed a definitive agreement with mcarthurglen an owner developer and manager of designer outlets to form one or more joint ventures to invest in certain of its existing designer outlets development projects and its property management and development companies in conjunction with that agreement we purchased a noncontrolling interest in the property management and development companies of mcarthurglen and a noncontrolling interest in a development property located in vancouver british columbia on august 2 2013 we acquired a noncontrolling interest in ashford designer outlets in kent uk on october 16 2013 we completed the remaining transactions contemplated by our previously announced definitive agreement with mcarthurglen by acquiring noncontrolling interests in portions of four existing mcarthurglen designer outlets — parndorf vienna austria la reggia naples italy noventa di piave venice italy and roermond roermond netherlands our legal ownership interests in these entities range from 225 to 90 

on may 30 2013 we acquired a 100 interest in a 390000 square foot outlet center located near portland oregon for cash consideration of 1467 million 

dispositions we continue to pursue the disposition of properties that no longer meet our strategic criteria or that are not a primary retail venue within their trade area 

during 2013 we increased our economic interest in three unconsolidated community centers and subsequently disposed of our interests in those properties additionally we disposed of our interests in eight consolidated retail properties and three unconsolidated retail properties the aggregate gain recognized on these transactions was approximately 802 million 

on august 8 2013 we disposed of our interest in an office property located in the boston massachusetts area the gain on the sale was 79 million which is included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 

development activity 

new domestic development during the third quarter of 2013 we began construction on charlotte premium outlets a 400000 square foot project located in charlotte north carolina we own a 50 noncontrolling interest in this project which is a joint venture with tanger factory outlet centers inc the center is expected to open in july of 2014 our estimated share of the cost of this project is 460 million 

in addition during the third quarter we began construction on twin cities premium outlets a 410000 square foot project located in eagan minnesota we own a 35 noncontrolling interest in this project the center is expected to open in august of 2014 our estimated share of the cost of this project is 380 million 

on august 22 2013 we opened st louis premium outlets a 350000 square foot upscale outlet center located in chesterfield missouri we own a 60 noncontrolling interest in this project which is a joint venture with woodmont outlets our share of the cost of this new center was approximately 500 million the center was 100 leased at opening 

on april 4 2013 we opened phoenix premium outlets in chandler arizona a 360000 square foot upscale outlet center the cost of this new center in which we have a 100 interest was approximately 700 million the center was 100 leased at opening 

domestic redevelopments and expansions we routinely incur costs related to construction for significant redevelopment and expansion projects at our properties we also have reinstituted redevelopment and expansion initiatives which we had previously reduced given the downturn in the economy redevelopment and expansion projects including the addition of anchors and big box tenants are underway at more than 25 properties in the us 

we expect our share of development costs for 2014 related to new development redevelopment or expansion initiatives to be approximately 11 billion we expect to fund these capital projects with cash flows from operations our estimated stabilized return on invested capital typically ranges between 1012 for all of our new development expansion and redevelopment projects 

capital expenditures on consolidated properties the following table summarizes total capital expenditures on consolidated properties on a cash basis in millions 



international development activity we typically reinvest net cash flow from our international joint ventures to fund future international development activity we believe this strategy mitigates some of the risk of our initial investment and our exposure to changes in foreign currencies we have also funded most of our foreign investments with local currencydenominated borrowings that act as a natural hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates our consolidated net income exposure to changes in the volatility of the euro yen won and other foreign currencies is not material we expect our share of international development costs for 2014 will be approximately 1800 million primarily funded through reinvested joint venture cash flow and construction loans 

the following table describes these new development and expansion projects as well as our share of the estimated total cost as of december 31 2013 in millions 



dividends 

common stock dividends during 2013 aggregated 465 per share common stock dividends during 2012 aggregated 410 per share in january of 2014 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 125 per share of common stock payable on february 28 2014 to stockholders of record on february 14 2014 we must pay a minimum amount of dividends to maintain our status as a reit our dividends typically exceed our net income generated in any given year primarily because of depreciation which is a noncash expense our future dividends and future distributions of the operating partnership will be determined by the board of directors based on actual results of operations cash available for dividends and limited partner distributions cash reserves as deemed necessary for capital and operating expenditures and the amount required to maintain our status as a reit

nongaap financial measures 

industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties in part based on performance measures such as ffo diluted ffo per share noi and comparable property noi we believe that these nongaap measures are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of reits and provide a relevant basis for comparison among reits we also use these measures internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio 

we determine ffo based on the definition set forth by the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit as consolidated net income computed in accordance with gaap 

• excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization • excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items and cumulative effects of accounting changes • excluding gains and losses from the sales or disposals of previously depreciated retail operating properties • excluding impairment charges of depreciable real estate • plus the allocable portion of ffo of unconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting based upon economic ownership interest and • all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with gaap we have adopted nareits clarification of the definition of ffo that requires us to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary cumulative effect of accounting changes or a gain or loss resulting from the sale or disposal of or any impairment charges related to previously depreciated operating properties 

we include in ffo gains and losses realized from the sale of land outlot buildings marketable and nonmarketable securities and investment holdings of nonretail real estate 

you should understand that our computation of these nongaap measures might not be comparable to similar measures reported by other reits and that these nongaap measures 

• do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap • should not be considered as alternatives to consolidated net income determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of operating performance and • are not alternatives to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 62 

the following schedule reconciles total ffo to consolidated net income and diluted net income per share to diluted ffo per share 



the following schedule reconciles noi to consolidated net income and sets forth the computations of comparable property noi 



1 noi from non comparable properties includes the mills communitylifestyle centers international properties other retail properties the mills limited partnership properties any of our nonretail holdings and results of our corporate and management company operations noi of us malls and premium outlets not owned and operated in both periods under comparison and excluded income noted in footnote 2 below 2 comparable properties are us malls and premium outlets that were owned in both of the periods under comparison excludes lease termination income interest income land sale gains and the impact of significant redevelopment activities 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule 13a15f or 15d15f promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as a process designed by or under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

• pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and disposition of assets • provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and • provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework 1992 

based on that assessment we believe that as of december 31 2013 our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 

item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk 

our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our longterm debt obligations we manage exposure to interest rate market risk through our risk management strategy by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of variable rate debt we are also exposed to foreign currency risk on financings of certain foreign operations our intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging these exposures we do not enter into either interest rate protection or foreign currency rate protection agreements for speculative purposes 

we may enter into treasury lock agreements as part of an anticipated debt issuance upon completion of the debt issuance the cost of these instruments is recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt agreement 

our future earnings cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest primarily libor which was at historically low levels during 2013 based upon consolidated indebtedness and interest rates at december 31 2013 a 50 basis point increase in the market rates of interest would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 88 million and would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately 4662 million

for a description of our operational strategies and developments in our business during 2012 see the managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of the 2012 annual report to stockholders filed as exhibit 131 to this form 10k 

other policies 

the following is a discussion of our investment policies financing policies conflict of interest policies and policies with respect to certain other activities one or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote 

investment policies 

while we emphasize equity real estate investments we may also provide secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers however any of these investments would be subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for reit qualification these reit limitations mean that we cannot make an investment that would cause our real estate assets to be less than 75 of our total assets we must also derive at least 75 of our gross income directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including rents from real property dividends from other reits and in certain circumstances interest from certain types of temporary investments in addition we must also derive at least 95 of our gross income from such real property investments and from dividends interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing 

subject to reit limitations we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate such an investment would normally be in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties we may in the future acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies 

financing policies 

because our reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of our taxable income we regularly access the debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions develop and redevelop properties and refinance maturing debt we must comply with the covenants contained in our financing agreements that limit our ratio of debt to total assets or market value as defined for example the operating partnerships line of credit and the indentures for the operating partnerships debt securities contain covenants that restrict the total amount of debt of the operating partnership to 65 or 60 in relation to certain debt of total assets as defined under the related 

arrangement and secured debt to 50 of total assets in addition these agreements contain other covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios furthermore the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for our equity securities and the debt securities of the operating partnership we strive to maintain investment grade ratings at all times but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so in the future 

if our board of directors determines to seek additional capital we may raise such capital by offering equity or debt securities creating joint ventures with existing ownership interests in properties entering into joint venture arrangements for new development projects retaining cash flows or a combination of these methods if the board of directors determines to raise equity capital it may without stockholder approval issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock the board of directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate such securities may be senior to the outstanding classes of common stock such securities also may include additional classes of preferred stock which may be convertible into common stock existing stockholders have no preemptive right to purchase shares in any subsequent offering of our securities any such offering could dilute a stockholders investment in us 

we expect most future borrowings would be made through the operating partnership or its subsidiaries we might however incur borrowings that would be reloaned to the operating partnership borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings publicly and privately placed debt instruments or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties any such indebtedness may be secured or unsecured any such indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to the borrower or crosscollateralized with other debt or may be fully or partially guaranteed by the operating partnership although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends we currently have no expectation that we will regularly do so 

the operating partnership has an unsecured revolving credit facility or the credit facility the credit facilitys initial borrowing capacity of 40 billion can be increased at our sole option to 50 billion during its term the credit facility will initially mature on october 30 2015 and can be extended for an additional year at our sole option on june 1 2012 we entered into an additional unsecured revolving credit facility or the supplemental facility with an initial borrowing capacity of 20 billion which can be increased at our sole option to 25 billion during its term the supplemental facility will initially mature on june 30 2016 and can be extended for an additional year at our sole option we issue debt securities through the operating partnership but we may issue our debt securities which may be convertible into capital stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase capital stock we also may sell or securitize our lease receivables 

we may also finance acquisitions through the following 

• issuance of shares of common stock or preferred stock • issuance of additional units of partnership interest in the operating partnership or units • issuance of preferred units of the operating partnership • issuance of other securities including unsecured notes and mortgage debt • draws on our credit facilities or • sale or exchange of ownership interests in properties the operating partnership may also issue units to transferors of properties or other partnership interests which may permit the transferor to defer gain recognition for tax purposes 

we do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property mortgage financing instruments however usually limit additional indebtedness on such properties additionally our unsecured credit facilities unsecured note indentures and other contracts may limit our ability to borrow and contain limits on mortgage indebtedness we may incur 

typically we invest in or form special purpose entities to assist us in obtaining secured permanent financing at attractive terms permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage loan on a single property or on a group of properties and generally requires us to provide a mortgage lien on the property or properties in favor of an institutional third party as a joint venture with a third party or as a securitized financing for securitized financings we create special purpose entities to own the properties these special purpose entities which are common in the real estate industry are structured so that they would not be consolidated in a bankruptcy proceeding involving a parent 

company we decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives for accounting purposes we include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness 

conflict of interest policies 

we maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest we have adopted governance principles governing the function conduct selection orientation and duties of our board of directors and the company as well as written charters for each of the standing committees of the board of directors in addition we have a code of business conduct and ethics which applies to all of our officers directors and employees and those of our subsidiaries at least a majority of the members of our board of directors must qualify as independent under the listing standards for new york stock exchange or nyse companies and cannot be affiliated with the simon family who are significant stockholders andor unitholders in the operating partnership in addition the audit and compensation committees of our board of directors are comprised of independent members in accordance with the independence requirements of the nyse any transaction between us and the simons including property acquisitions service and property management agreements and retail space leases must be approved by a majority of our independent directors 

the sale by the operating partnership of any property that it owns may have an adverse tax impact on the simons andor other limited partners of the operating partnership in order to avoid any conflict of interest between simon property and the simons our charter requires that at least six of our independent directors must authorize and require the operating partnership to sell any property it owns any such sale is subject to applicable agreements with third parties noncompetition agreements executed by herbert simon and david simon contain covenants limiting their ability to participate in certain shopping center activities 

policies with respect to certain other activities 

we intend to make investments which are consistent with our qualification as a reit unless the board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to so qualify as a reit the board of directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the reit requirements we have authority to offer shares of our capital stock or other securities in exchange for property we also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities we may issue shares of our common stock or cash at our option to holders of units in future periods upon exercise of such holders rights under the operating partnership agreement our policy prohibits us from making any loans to our directors or executive officers for any purpose we may make loans to the joint ventures in which we participate additionally we may make or buy interests in loans for real estate properties owned by others 

competition 

the retail industry is dynamic and competitive we compete with numerous merchandise distribution channels including malls outlet centers communitylifestyle centers and other shopping centers in the united states and abroad we also compete with internet retailing sites and catalogs which provide retailers with distribution options beyond existing brick and mortar retail properties the existence of competitive alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we can obtain this results in competition for both the tenants to occupy the properties that we develop and manage as well as for the acquisition of prime sites including land for development and operating properties we believe that there are numerous factors that make our properties highly desirable to retailers including 

• the quality location and diversity of our properties • our management and operational expertise • our extensive experience and relationships with retailers and lenders and • our mall marketing initiatives and consumer focused strategic corporate alliances 5

 item 1a risk factors 

  the following factors among others could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows and you should carefully consider them additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which are currently not believed to be material may also affect our actual results we may update these factors in our future periodic reports 

risks relating to debt and the financial markets 

we have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations 

as of december 31 2012 our consolidated mortgages and other indebtedness excluding related premium and discount totaled 231 billion we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the property such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants cause a reduction in the income from the property should such events occur our operations may be adversely affected if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value 

disruption in the credit markets or downgrades in our credit ratings may adversely affect our ability to access external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements 

we depend on external financings principally debt financings to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt our access to financing depends on our credit rating the willingness of banks to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature or that the financing available to us will be on acceptable terms 

adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

our outstanding senior unsecured notes and preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and the economic outlook in general our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund our growth adverse changes in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our future growth 

our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk 

we selectively manage our exposure to interest rate risk by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of our variable rate debt in addition we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and terms are appropriate our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful 

our use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs 

factors affecting real estate investments and operations 

we face risks associated with the acquisition development redevelopment and expansion of properties 

we regularly acquire and develop new properties and expand and redevelop existing properties and these activities are subject to various risks we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition development or redevelopment 

expansion opportunities in addition newly acquired developed or redevelopedexpanded properties may not perform as well as expected we are subject to other risks in connection with any acquisition development and redevelopmentexpansion activities including the following 

• construction costs of a project may be higher than projected potentially making the project unfeasible or unprofitable • we may not be able to obtain financing or to refinance loans on favorable terms if at all • we may be unable to obtain zoning occupancy or other governmental approvals • occupancy rates and rents may not meet our projections and the project may not be profitable and • we may need the consent of third parties such as anchor tenants mortgage lenders and joint venture partners and those consents may be withheld if a development or redevelopmentexpansion project is unsuccessful either because it is not meeting our expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project planning we could lose our investment in the project further if we guarantee the propertys financing our loss could exceed our investment in the project 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid 

our properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets these investments are relatively illiquid as a result our ability to sell one or more of our properties or investments in real estate in response to any changes in economic or other conditions may be limited if we want to sell a property we cannot assure you that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or that the sales price of a property will exceed the cost of our investment 

our international expansion may subject us to different or greater risk from those associated with our domestic operations 

as of december 31 2012 we hold interests in joint venture properties that operate in japan south korea mexico and malaysia we also have an equity stake in klépierre a publiclytraded european real estate company accordingly our operating results and the value of our international operations may be impacted by any unhedged movements in the foreign currencies in which those operations transact and in which our net investment in the foreign operation is held we may pursue additional expansion and development opportunities outside the united states international development and ownership activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our domestic properties and operations these risks include 

• adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies • changes in foreign political and economic environments regionally nationally and locally • challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws including corporate governance operations taxes and litigation • differing lending practices • differences in cultures • changes in applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect foreign operations • difficulties in managing international operations and • obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash although our international activities currently are a relatively small portion of our business international properties represented approximately 63 of net operating income or noi for the year ended december 31 2012 to the extent that we expand our international activities these risks could increase in significance which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

environmental risks 

as owners of real estate we can face liabilities for environmental contamination 

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require us as a current or previous owner or operator of real property to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at a property or at impacted neighboring properties these laws often impose liability regardless of whether the property owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances these laws and regulations may require the abatement or removal of asbestos containing materials in the event of damage demolition or renovation reconstruction or expansion of a property and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air those laws and regulations also govern the installation maintenance and removal of underground storage tanks used to store waste oils or other petroleum products many of our properties contain or at one time contained asbestos containing materials or underground storage tanks primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition but is not estimable the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may also adversely affect our ability to sell lease or redevelop a property or to borrow using a property as collateral 

our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful 

although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances this belief is based on limited testing nearly all of our properties have been subjected to phase i or similar environmental audits these environmental audits have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition however we cannot assure you that 

• existing environmental studies with respect to the portfolio reveal all potential environmental liabilities • any previous owner occupant or tenant of a property did not create any material environmental condition not known to us • the current environmental condition of the portfolio will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by other unrelated third parties or • future uses or conditions including without limitation changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof will not result in environmental liabilities retail operations risks 

overall economic conditions may adversely affect the general retail environment 

our concentration in the retail real estate market means that we are subject to the risks that affect the retail environment generally including the levels of consumer spending seasonality the willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers tenant bankruptcies changes in economic conditions increasing use of the internet by retailers and consumers consumer confidence casualties and other natural disasters and the potential for terrorist activities the economy and consumer spending appear to be recovering from the effects of the recent recession we derive our cash flow from operations primarily from retail tenants many of whom have been and continue to be under some degree of economic stress a significant deterioration in our cash flow from operations could require us to curtail planned capital expenditures or seek alternative sources of financing 

we may not be able to lease newly developed properties and renew leases and relet space at existing properties 

we may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants or for rents that are consistent with our projections also when leases for our existing properties expire the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms to the extent that our leasing plans are not achieved our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures could be adversely affected changes in economic and operating conditions that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other assets could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future charges to earnings if assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results 

some of our properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of or a store closure by one or more of these tenants 

malls are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally recognized tenants the value of some of our properties could be adversely affected if these tenants fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations department store and larger store also referred to as big box consolidations typically result in the closure of existing stores or duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations we do not control the disposition of those department stores or larger stores that we do not own we also may not control the vacant space that is not released in those stores we do own other tenants may be entitled to modify the terms of their existing leases in the event of such closures the modification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and could decrease rents or expense recovery charges additionally major tenant closures may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sales at other stores if the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to closing of anchors economic conditions or other reasons tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges in the event of default by a tenant or anchor store we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with those parties 

we face potential adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies 

bankruptcy filings by retailers occur regularly in the course of our operations we continually seek to release vacant spaces resulting from tenant terminations the bankruptcy of a tenant particularly an anchor tenant may make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the affected properties future tenant bankruptcies could adversely affect our properties or impact our ability to successfully execute our releasing strategy 

we face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably 

our properties compete with other retail properties and other forms of retailing such as catalogs and ecommerce websites competition may come from malls outlet centers communitylifestyle centers and other shopping centers both existing as well as future development projects as well as catalogs and ecommerce the presence of competitive alternatives affects our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain new construction renovations and expansions at competing sites could also negatively affect our properties 

we also compete with other retail property developers to acquire prime development sites in addition we compete with other retail property companies for tenants and qualified management 

risks relating to joint venture properties 

we have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance them 

as of december 31 2012 we owned interests in 108 incomeproducing properties with other parties of those 18 properties are included in our consolidated financial statements we account for the other 90 properties under the equity method of accounting which we refer to as joint venture properties we serve as general partner or property manager for 74 of these 90 properties however certain major decisions such as approving the operating budget and selling refinancing and redeveloping the properties require the consent of the other owners of the properties for which we do not serve as general partner or property manager 12 are in our international joint ventures the other owners also have other participating rights that we consider substantive for purposes of determining control over the properties assets the remaining joint venture properties are managed by third parties these limitations may adversely affect our ability to sell refinance or otherwise operate these properties 

the operating partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties 

joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property as of december 31 2012 the operating partnership had guaranteed 849 million of joint venture related mortgage or other indebtedness a default by a joint venture under its debt obligations may expose us to liability under a guaranty or letter of credit we may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests advances or partner loans although such fundings are not required contractually or otherwise 

other factors affecting our business 

some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance 

we maintain insurance coverage with third party carriers who provide a portion of the coverage for specific layers of potential losses including commercial general liability fire flood extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties in the united states the initial portion of coverage not provided by third party carriers is either insured through our whollyowned captive insurance companies or other financial arrangements controlled by us a third party carrier has in turn agreed to provide evidence of coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carriers policy a similar policy written through our captive insurance entities also provides initial coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal windstorm locations 

there are some types of losses including lease and other contract claims which generally are not insured if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue it could generate 

we currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the united states on an all risk basis in the amount of up to 1 billion the current federal laws which provide this coverage are expected to operate through 2014 despite the existence of this insurance coverage any threatened or actual terrorist attacks where we operate could adversely affect our property values revenues consumer traffic and tenant sales 

risks relating to income taxes 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit in the united states and certain of our international operations currently receive favorable tax treatment 

we are subject to certain incomebased taxes both domestically and internationally and other taxes including state and local taxes franchise taxes and withholding taxes on dividends from certain of our international investments we currently receive favorable tax treatment in various domestic and international jurisdictions through tax rules and regulations or through international treaties should we no longer receive such benefits the amount of taxes we pay may increase 

in the us we have elected to be taxed as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code we believe we have been organized and operated in a manner which allows us to qualify for taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code we intend to continue to operate in this manner however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the internal revenue code reit qualification is governed by highly technical and complex provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

if we fail to comply with those provisions we may be subject to monetary penalties or ultimately to possible disqualification as a reit if such events occurs and if available relief provisions do not apply 

• we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income • we will be subject to corporate level income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and • unless entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions we will also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost

for a description of our operational strategies and developments in our business during 2011 see the managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of the 2011 annual report to shareholders filed as exhibit 131 to this form 10k 

other policies 

the following is a discussion of our investment policies financing policies conflict of interest policies and policies with respect to certain other activities one or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote 

investment policies 

while we emphasize equity real estate investments we may invest in equity or debt securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers however any of these investments would be subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for reit qualification these reit limitations mean that we cannot make an investment that would cause our real estate assets to be less than 75 of our total assets in addition at least 75 of our gross income must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including rents from real property dividends from other reits and in certain circumstances interest from certain types of temporary investments at least 95 of our income must be derived from such real property investments and from dividends interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing 

subject to reit limitations we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate such an investment would normally be in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties we may in the future acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies 

financing policies 

because our reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of our taxable income we regularly access the debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions develop and redevelop properties and refinance maturing debt we must comply with the covenants contained in our financing agreements that limit our ratio of debt to total assets or market value as defined for example the operating partnerships line of credit and the indentures for the operating partnerships debt securities contain covenants that restrict the total amount of debt of the operating partnership to 65 or 60 in relation to certain debt of total assets as defined under the related arrangement and secured debt to 50 of total assets in addition these agreements contain other covenants requiring 

compliance with financial ratios furthermore the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for our equity securities and the debt securities of the operating partnership we strive to maintain investment grade ratings at all times but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so in the future 

if our board of directors determines to seek additional capital we may also raise such capital by offering equity or debt securities creating joint ventures with existing ownership interests in properties retaining cash flows or a combination of these methods if the board of directors determines to raise additional equity capital it may without stockholder approval issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock the board of directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate such securities may be senior to the outstanding classes of common stock such securities also may include additional classes of preferred stock which may be convertible into common stock existing stockholders have no preemptive right to purchase shares in any subsequent offering of our securities any such offering could dilute a stockholders investment in us 

we expect most future borrowings would be made through the operating partnership or its subsidiaries we might however incur borrowings that would be reloaned to the operating partnership borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings publicly and privately placed debt instruments or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties any such indebtedness may be secured or unsecured any such indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to the borrower or crosscollateralized with other debt or may be fully or partially guaranteed by the operating partnership although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends we currently have no expectation that we will regularly be required to do so 

on october 5 2011 the operating partnership entered into a new unsecured revolving credit facility or credit facility providing an initial borrowing capacity of 40 billion which can be increased at our option to 50 billion during its term the credit facility will initially mature on october 30 2015 and can be extended for an additional year at our sole option the credit facility replaced a 39 billion unsecured revolving credit facility we issue debt securities through the operating partnership but we may issue our debt securities which may be convertible into capital stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase capital stock we also may sell or securitize our lease receivables the proceeds from any borrowings or financings may be used for one or more of the following 

• financing acquisitions • developing or redeveloping properties • refinancing existing indebtedness • working capital or capital improvements or • meeting the taxable income distribution requirements applicable to reits if we have taxable income without the receipt of cash sufficient to enable us to meet such distribution requirements we may also finance acquisitions through the following 

• issuance of shares of common stock or preferred stock of simon property • issuance of additional units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership or units • issuance of preferred units of the operating partnership • issuance of other securities including unsecured notes and mortgage debt or • sale or exchange of ownership interests in properties the ability of the operating partnership to issue units to transferors of properties or other partnership interests may permit the transferor to defer gain recognition for tax purposes 

we do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property mortgage financing instruments however usually limit additional indebtedness on such properties additionally our unsecured credit facility and unsecured note indentures contain limits on mortgage indebtedness we may incur 

typically we invest in or form special purpose entities to assist us in obtaining permanent financing at attractive terms permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage loan on a single property or on a group of properties and generally requires us to provide a mortgage interest on the property or properties in favor of an institutional third 

party as a joint venture with a third party or as a securitized financing for securitized financings we create special purpose entities to own the properties these special purpose entities which are common in the real estate industry are structured so that they would not be consolidated in a bankruptcy proceeding involving a parent company we decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives for accounting purposes we include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness 

conflict of interest policies 

we maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest we have adopted governance principles governing the function conduct selection orientation and duties of our board of directors and the company as well as written charters for each of the standing committees of the board of directors in addition we have a code of business conduct and ethics which applies to all of our officers directors and employees at least a majority of the members of our board of directors must qualify as independent under the listing standards for new york stock exchange companies and cannot be affiliated with the simon family who are significant stockholders andor unitholders in the operating partnership any transaction between us and the simons including property acquisitions service and property management agreements and retail space leases must be approved by a majority of our nonaffiliated directors 

the sale by the operating partnership of any property that it owns may have an adverse tax impact on the simons andor other limited partners of the operating partnership in order to avoid any conflict of interest between simon property group and the simons our charter requires that at least six of our independent directors must authorize and require the operating partnership to sell any property it owns any such sale is subject to applicable agreements with third parties noncompetition agreements executed by herbert simon and david simon contain covenants limiting their ability to participate in certain shopping center activities in north america 

policies with respect to certain other activities 

we intend to make investments which are consistent with our qualification as a reit unless the board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to so qualify as a reit the board of directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the reit requirements we have authority to offer shares of our capital stock or other securities in exchange for property we also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities we may issue shares of our common stock or cash at our option to holders of units in future periods upon exercise of such holders rights under the operating partnership agreement our policy prohibits us from making any loans to our directors or executive officers for any purpose we may make loans to the joint ventures in which we participate additionally we may make or buy interests in loans for real estate properties owned by others 

competition 

the retail industry is dynamic and competitive we compete with numerous merchandise distribution channels including regional malls outlet centers communitylifestyle centers and other shopping centers in the united states and abroad we also compete with internet retailing sites and catalogs which provide retailers with distribution options beyond existing brick and mortar retail properties the existence of competitive alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we can obtain this results in competition for both the tenants to occupy the properties that we develop and manage as well as for the acquisition of prime sites including land for development and operating properties we believe that there are numerous factors that make our properties highly desirable to retailers including 

• the quality location and diversity of our properties • our management and operational expertise • our extensive experience and relationships with retailers and lenders and • our mall marketing initiatives and consumer focused strategic corporate alliances 5

 item 1a risk factors 

  the following factors among others could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time these factors among others may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows and you should carefully consider them it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties and we may update them in our future periodic reports 

risks relating to debt and the financial markets 

we have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations 

as of december 31 2011 our consolidated mortgages and other indebtedness excluding the related premium and discount totaled 184 billion we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the property such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants cause a reduction in the income from the property should such events occur our operations may be adversely affected if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from this is insufficient to pay that indebtedness the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value 

disruption in the credit markets or downgrades in our credit ratings may adversely affect our ability to access external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements 

we depend on external financings principally debt financings to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt our access to financing depends on our credit rating the willingness of banks to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature or that the financing available to us will be on acceptable terms 

adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

our outstanding senior unsecured notes and preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and the economic outlook in general our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund our growth adverse changes in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our future growth 

our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk 

we selectively manage our exposure to interest rate risk by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of our variable rate debt in addition we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and terms are appropriate our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful 

our use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs 

factors affecting real estate investments and operations 

we face risks associated with the acquisition development redevelopment and expansion of properties 

we regularly acquire and develop new properties and expand and redevelop existing properties and these activities are subject to various risks we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition development or redevelopment 

expansion opportunities in addition newly acquired developed or redevelopedexpanded properties may not perform as well as expected we are subject to other risks in connection with any acquisition development and redevelopmentexpansion activities including the following 

• construction costs of a project may be higher than projected potentially making the project unfeasible or unprofitable • we may not be able to obtain financing or to refinance loans on favorable terms if at all • we may be unable to obtain zoning occupancy or other governmental approvals • occupancy rates and rents may not meet our projections and the project may not be profitable and • we may need the consent of third parties such as anchor tenants mortgage lenders and joint venture partners and those consents may be withheld if a development or redevelopmentexpansion project is unsuccessful either because it is not meeting our expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project planning we could lose our investment in the project further if we guarantee the propertys financing our loss could exceed our investment in the project 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid 

our properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets these investments are relatively illiquid as a result our ability to sell one or more of our properties or investments in real estate in response to any changes in economic or other conditions is limited if we want to sell a property we cannot assure you that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or that the sales price of a property will exceed the cost of our investment 

environmental risks 

as owners of real estate we can face liabilities for environmental contamination 

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require us as a current or previous owner or operator of real property to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at a property or at impacted neighboring properties these laws often impose liability regardless of whether the property owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances these laws and regulations may require the abatement or removal of asbestos containing materials in the event of damage demolition or renovation reconstruction or expansion of a property and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air those laws and regulations also govern the installation maintenance and removal of underground storage tanks used to store waste oils or other petroleum products many of our properties contain or at one time contained asbestos containing materials or underground storage tanks primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition but is not estimable the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may also adversely affect our ability to sell lease or redevelop a property or to borrow using a property as collateral 

our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful 

although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances this belief is based on limited testing nearly all of our properties have been subjected to phase i or similar environmental audits these environmental audits have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition however we cannot assure you that 

• existing environmental studies with respect to the portfolio reveal all potential environmental liabilities • any previous owner occupant or tenant of a property did not create any material environmental condition not known to us • the current environmental condition of the portfolio will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by other unrelated third parties or 9 

• future uses or conditions including without limitation changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof will not result in environmental liabilities retail operations risks 

overall economic conditions may adversely affect the general retail environment 

our concentration in the retail real estate market means that we are subject to the risks that affect the retail environment generally including the levels of consumer spending seasonality the willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers tenant bankruptcies changes in economic conditions increasing use of the internet by retailers and consumers consumer confidence casualties and other natural disasters and the potential for terrorist activities the economy and consumer spending appear to be recovering from the effects of the recent recession we derive our cash flow from operations primarily from retail tenants many of whom have been and continue to be under some degree of economic stress a significant deterioration in our cash flow from operations could require us to curtail planned capital expenditures or seek alternative sources of financing 

we may not be able to lease newly developed properties and renew leases and relet space at existing properties 

we may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants or for rents that are consistent with our projections also when leases for our existing properties expire the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms to the extent that our leasing plans are not achieved our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures could be adversely affected changes in economic and operating conditions that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other assets could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future charges to earnings if assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results 

some of our properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of or a store closure by one or more of these tenants 

regional malls are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally recognized tenants the value of some of our properties could be adversely affected if these tenants fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations department store and larger store also referred to as big box consolidations typically result in the closure of existing stores or duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations we do not control the disposition of those department stores or larger stores that we do not own we also may not control the vacant space that is not released in those stores we do own other tenants may be entitled to modify the terms of their existing leases in the event of such closures the modification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and could decrease rents or expense recovery charges additionally major tenant closures may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sales at other stores if the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to closing of anchors economic conditions or other reasons tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges in the event of default by a tenant or anchor store we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with those parties 

we face potential adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies 

bankruptcy filings by retailers occur regularly in the course of our operations we continually seek to release vacant spaces caused by tenant bankruptcies however our efforts to release the vacated space may not be successful additionally the bankruptcy of a tenant particularly an anchor tenant may make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the affected properties future tenant bankruptcies could adversely affect our properties or impact our ability to successfully execute our releasing strategy 

risks relating to joint venture properties 

we have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance them 

as of december 31 2011 we owned interests in 164 incomeproducing properties with other parties of those 20 properties are included in our consolidated financial statements we account for the other 144 properties under the 

equity method of accounting which we refer to as joint venture properties we serve as general partner or property manager for 85 of these 144 properties however certain major decisions such as approving the operating budget and selling refinancing and redeveloping the properties require the consent of the other owners of the properties for which we do not serve as general partner or property manager 57 are in our international joint ventures the other owners also have other participating rights that we consider substantive for purposes of determining control over the properties assets the remaining joint venture properties are managed by third parties these limitations may adversely affect our ability to sell refinance or otherwise operate these properties 

the operating partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties 

joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property as of december 31 2011 the operating partnership has loan guarantees to support 302 million of our total 65 billion share of joint venture mortgage and other indebtedness a default by a joint venture under its debt obligations may expose us to liability under a guaranty or letter of credit 

other factors affecting our business 

our common area maintenance cam contributions may not allow us to recover the majority of our operating expenses from tenants 

cam costs typically include allocable energy costs repairs maintenance and capital improvements to common areas janitorial services administrative property and liability insurance costs and security costs we have leases with variable cam provisions that adjust to reflect inflationary increases we have converted a substantial portion of our leases to a fixed payment methodology which fixes our tenants cam contributions and should in turn reduce the volatility of and limitations on the recoveries we collect from our tenants for the reimbursement of our property operating expenses however with respect to both variable and fixed payment methodologies the amount of cam charges we bill to our tenants may not allow us to recover all of these operating costs 

we face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably 

our properties compete with other retail properties and other forms of retailing such as catalogs and ecommerce websites competition may come from regional malls outlet centers communitylifestyle centers and other shopping centers both existing as well as future development projects the presence of competitive alternatives affects our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain new construction renovations and expansions at competing sites could also negatively affect our properties we also compete with other retail property developers to acquire prime development sites in addition we compete with other retail property companies for tenants and qualified management 

our international expansion may subject us to different or greater risk from those associated with our domestic operations 

as of december 31 2011 we held interests in joint venture properties that operate in italy our interests in which were sold in january 2012 japan south korea mexico and malaysia we also hold a minority investment in two uk real estate companies we may pursue additional expansion opportunities outside the united states international development and ownership activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our domestic properties and operations these risks include 

• adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies • changes in foreign political and economic environments regionally nationally and locally • challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws including corporate governance operations taxes and litigation • differing lending practices • differences in cultures • changes in applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect foreign operations • difficulties in managing international operations and 11 

• obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash although our international activities currently are a relatively small portion of our business international properties represented approximately 54 of the gross leasable area of all of our properties at december 31 2011 to the extent that we expand our international activities these risks could increase in significance which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance 

we maintain insurance coverage with third party carriers who provide a portion of the coverage for specific layers of potential losses including commercial general liability fire flood extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties in the united states the initial portion of coverage not provided by third party carriers is either insured through our whollyowned captive insurance companies rosewood indemnity ltd and bridgewood insurance company ltd or other financial arrangements controlled by us the third party carrier has in turn agreed to provide evidence of coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carriers policy a similar policy written through our captive insurance entities also provides initial coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal windstorm locations 

there are some types of losses including lease and other contract claims which generally are not insured if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue it could generate 

we currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the united states on an all risk basis in the amount of up to 1 billion the current federal laws which provide this coverage are expected to operate through 2014 despite the existence of this insurance coverage any threatened or actual terrorist attacks where we operate could adversely affect our property values revenues consumer traffic and tenant sales 

risks relating to federal income taxes 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the internal revenue code we believe we have been organized and operated in a manner which allows us to qualify for taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code we intend to continue to operate in this manner however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the internal revenue code reit qualification is governed by highly technical and complex provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

if we fail to comply with those provisions we may be subject to monetary penalties or to possible disqualification as a reit if such events occurs and if available relief provisions do not apply 

• we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income • we will be subject to corporate level income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and • unless entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions we will also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost

other policies 

the following is a discussion of our investment policies financing policies conflict of interest policies and policies with respect to certain other activities one or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote 

investment policies 

while we emphasize equity real estate investments we may invest in equity or debt securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers however any of these investments would be subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for reit qualification these reit limitations mean that we cannot make an investment that would cause our real estate assets to be less than 75 of our total assets in addition at least 75 of our gross income must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including rents from real property dividends from other reits and in certain circumstances interest from certain types of temporary investments at least 95 of our income must be derived from such real property investments and from dividends interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing 

subject to reit limitations we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate such an investment would normally be in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties we may in the future acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies 

financing policies 

we must comply with the covenants contained in our financing agreements that limit our ratio of debt to total assets or market value as defined for example the operating partnerships line of credit and the indentures for the operating partnerships debt securities contain covenants that restrict the total amount of debt of the operating partnership to 65 or 60 in relation to certain debt of total assets as defined under the related arrangement and secured debt to 50 of total assets in addition these agreements contain other covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios furthermore the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for our equity securities and the debt securities of the operating partnership we strive to maintain investment grade ratings at all times but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 

if our board of directors determines to seek additional capital we may raise such capital by offering equity or debt securities creating joint ventures with existing ownership interests in properties retaining cash flows or a combination of these methods our ability to retain cash flows is limited by the requirement for reits to distribute at least 90 of their taxable income we must also take into account taxes that would be imposed on undistributed taxable income if the board of directors determines to raise additional equity capital it may without stockholder approval issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock the board of directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate such securities may be senior to the outstanding classes of common stock such securities also may include additional classes of preferred stock which may be convertible into common stock existing stockholders have no preemptive right to purchase shares in any subsequent offering of our securities any such offering could dilute a stockholders investment in us 

we expect most future borrowings would be made through the operating partnership or its subsidiaries we might however incur borrowings that would be reloaned to the operating partnership borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings publicly and privately placed debt instruments or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties any such indebtedness may be secured or unsecured any such indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to the borrower or crosscollateralized with other debt or may be fully or partially guaranteed by the operating partnership although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends we currently have no expectation that we will regularly be required to do so 

the operating partnership has a 39 billion unsecured revolving credit facility or the credit facility the credit facility has an accordion feature allowing the maximum borrowing capacity to expand to 40 billion we issue debt securities through the operating partnership but we may issue our debt securities which may be convertible into capital stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase capital stock we also may sell or securitize our lease receivables the proceeds from any borrowings or financings may be used for one or more of the following 

• financing acquisitions • developing or redeveloping properties • refinancing existing indebtedness • working capital or capital improvements or • meeting the taxable income distribution requirements applicable to reits if we have taxable income without the receipt of cash sufficient to enable us to meet such distribution requirements we may also finance acquisitions through the following 

• issuance of shares of common stock or preferred stock • issuance of additional units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership or units • issuance of preferred units of the operating partnership • issuance of other securities or • sale or exchange of ownership interests in properties the ability of the operating partnership to issue units to transferors of properties or other partnership interests may permit the transferor to defer gain recognition for tax purposes it may also be advantageous for us since there are ownership limits that restrict the number of shares of our capital stock that investors may own 

we do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property mortgage financing instruments however usually limit additional indebtedness on such properties we also have covenants on our unsecured debt that limit our total secured debt 

typically we invest in or form special purpose entities to assist us in obtaining permanent financing at attractive terms permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage loan on a single property or on a group of properties and generally requires us to provide a mortgage interest on the property in favor of an institutional third party as a joint venture with a third party or as a securitized financing for securitized financings we create special purpose entities to own the properties these special purpose entities which are common in the real estate industry are structured so that they would not be consolidated in a bankruptcy proceeding involving a parent company we decide 

upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives for accounting purposes we include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness 

conflict of interest policies 

we maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest we have adopted governance principles governing the function conduct selection orientation and duties of our board of directors and the company as well as written charters for each of the standing committees of the board of directors in addition we have a code of business conduct and ethics which applies to all of our officers directors and employees at least a majority of the members of our board of directors must qualify as independent under the listing standards for new york stock exchange companies and cannot be affiliated with the simon family who are significant stockholders andor unitholders in the operating partnership any transaction between us and the simons including property acquisitions service and property management agreements and retail space leases must be approved by a majority of our nonaffiliated directors 

the sale by the operating partnership of any property that it owns may have an adverse tax impact on the simons andor other limited partners of the operating partnership in order to avoid any conflict of interest between simon property and the simons our charter requires that at least six of our independent directors must authorize and require the operating partnership to sell any property it owns any such sale is subject to applicable agreements with third parties noncompetition agreements executed by each of the simons contain covenants limiting the ability of the simons to participate in certain shopping center activities in north america 

policies with respect to certain other activities 

we intend to make investments which are consistent with our qualification as a reit unless the board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to so qualify as a reit the board of directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the reit requirements we have authority to offer shares of our capital stock or other securities in exchange for property we also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities we may issue shares of our common stock or cash at our option to holders of units in future periods upon exercise of such holders rights under the operating partnership agreement our policy prohibits us from making any loans to our directors or executive officers for any purpose we may make loans to the joint ventures in which we participate 

competition 

the retail industry is dynamic and competitive we compete with numerous merchandise distribution channels including regional malls outlet centers communitylifestyle centers and other shopping centers in the united states and abroad internet retailing sites and catalogs also provide retailers with distribution options beyond existing brick and mortar retail properties the existence of competitive alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we can obtain this results in competition for both the tenants to occupy the properties that we develop and manage as well as for the acquisition of prime sites including land for development and operating properties we believe that there are numerous factors that make our properties highly desirable to retailers including 

• the quality location and diversity of our properties • our management and operational expertise • our extensive experience and relationships with retailers and lenders • our mall marketing initiatives and consumer focused strategic corporate alliances and certain activities 

during the past three years we have 

• issued 4688722 shares of common stock upon the exchange of units of limited partnership interest of the operating partnership 5

 item 1a risk factors 

  the following factors among others could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time these factors among others may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows and you should carefully consider them it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties and we may update them in our future periodic reports 

risks relating to debt and the financial markets 

we have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations 

as of december 31 2010 our consolidated mortgages and other indebtedness excluding the related premium and discount totaled 175 billion we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the property such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants cause a reduction in the income from the property should such events occur our operations may be adversely affected if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from this is insufficient to pay that indebtedness the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value 

disruption in the credit markets or downgrades in our credit ratings may adversely affect our ability to access external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements 

we depend primarily on external financings principally debt financings to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt our access to financing depends on our credit rating the willingness of banks to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature or that the financing available to us will be on acceptable terms 

adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

our outstanding senior unsecured notes and preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and the economic outlook in general our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund our growth adverse changes in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our future growth 

our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk 

we manage our exposure to interest rate risk by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of our variable rate debt in addition we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and terms are appropriate our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful 

our use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs 

factors affecting real estate investments and operations 

we face risks associated with the acquisition development and expansion of properties 

we regularly acquire and develop new properties and expand and redevelop existing properties and these activities are subject to various risks we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition development or redevelopmentexpansion opportunities in addition newly acquired developed or redevelopedexpanded properties may not perform 

as well as expected we are subject to other risks in connection with any acquisition development and redevelopmentexpansion activities including the following 

• construction costs of a project may be higher than projected potentially making the project unfeasible or unprofitable • we may not be able to obtain financing or to refinance construction loans on favorable terms if at all • we may be unable to obtain zoning occupancy or other governmental approvals • occupancy rates and rents may not meet our projections and the project may not be profitable and • we may need the consent of third parties such as anchor tenants mortgage lenders and joint venture partners and those consents may be withheld if a development or redevelopmentexpansion project is unsuccessful either because it is not meeting our expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project planning we could lose our investment in the project further if we guarantee the propertys financing our loss could exceed our investment in the project 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid 

our properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets these investments are relatively illiquid as a result our ability to sell one or more of our properties or investments in real estate in response to any changes in economic or other conditions is limited if we want to sell a property we cannot assure you that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or that the sales price of a property will exceed the cost of our investment 

environmental risks 

as owners of real estate we can face liabilities for environmental contamination 

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require us as a current or previous owner or operator of real property to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at a property or at impacted neighboring properties these laws often impose liability regardless of whether the property owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances these laws and regulations may require the abatement or removal of asbestos containing materials in the event of damage demolition or renovation reconstruction or expansion of a property and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air those laws and regulations also govern the installation maintenance and removal of underground storage tanks used to store waste oils or other petroleum products many of our properties contain or at one time contained asbestos containing materials or underground storage tanks primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition but is not estimable the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may also adversely affect our ability to sell lease or redevelop a property or to borrow using a property as collateral 

our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful 

although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances this belief is based on limited testing nearly all of our properties have been subjected to phase i or similar environmental audits these environmental audits have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition however we cannot assure you that 

• existing environmental studies with respect to the portfolio reveal all potential environmental liabilities • any previous owner occupant or tenant of a property did not create any material environmental condition not known to us • the current environmental condition of the portfolio will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by other unrelated third parties or 9 

• future uses or conditions including without limitation changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof will not result in environmental liabilities retail operations risks 

overall economic conditions may adversely affect the general retail environment 

our concentration in the retail real estate market means that we are subject to the risks that affect the retail environment generally including the levels of consumer spending seasonality the willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers tenant bankruptcies changes in economic conditions consumer confidence casualties and other natural disasters and the potential for terrorist activities the economy and consumer spending appear to be recovering from the effects of the recent recession we derive our cash flow from operations primarily from retail tenants many of whom have been and continue to be under some degree of economic stress a significant deterioration in our cash flow from operations could require us to curtail planned capital expenditures or seek alternative sources of financing 

we may not be able to lease newly developed properties and renew leases and relet space at existing properties 

we may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants or for rents that are consistent with our projections also when leases for our existing properties expire the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms to the extent that our leasing plans are not achieved our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures could be adversely affected 

some of our properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of or a store closure by one or more of these tenants 

regional malls are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally recognized tenants the value of some of our properties could be adversely affected if these tenants fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations department store and larger store also referred to as big box consolidations typically result in the closure of existing stores or duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations we do not control the disposition of those department stores or larger stores that we do not own we also may not control the vacant space that is not released in those stores we do own other tenants may be entitled to modify the terms of their existing leases in the event of such closures the modification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and could decrease rents or expense recovery charges additionally major tenant closures may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sales at other stores if the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to closing of anchors economic conditions or other reasons tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges in the event of default by a tenant or anchor store we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with those parties 

we face potential adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies 

bankruptcy filings by retailers occur regularly in the course of our operations we continually seek to release vacant spaces resulting from tenant terminations the bankruptcy of a tenant particularly an anchor tenant may make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the affected properties future tenant bankruptcies could adversely affect our properties or impact our ability to successfully execute our releasing strategy 

risks relating to joint venture properties 

we have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance them 

as of december 31 2010 we owned interests in 175 incomeproducing properties with other parties of those 19 properties are included in our consolidated financial statements we account for the other 156 properties under the equity method of accounting which we refer to as joint venture properties we serve as general partner or property manager for 92 of these 156 properties however certain major decisions such as selling or refinancing these properties require the consent of the other owners of the properties for which we do not serve as general partner or property manager 55 are in our international joint ventures the other owners also have other participating rights that 

we consider substantive for purposes of determining control over the properties assets the remaining joint venture properties are managed by third parties these limitations may adversely affect our ability to sell refinance or otherwise operate these properties 

the operating partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties 

joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property as of december 31 2010 the operating partnership has loan guarantees to support 607 million of our total 66 billion share of joint venture mortgage and other indebtedness a default by a joint venture under its debt obligations may expose us to liability under a guaranty or letter of credit 

other factors affecting our business 

our common area maintenance cam contributions may not allow us to recover the majority of our operating expenses from tenants 

cam costs typically include allocable energy costs repairs maintenance and capital improvements to common areas janitorial services administrative property and liability insurance costs and security costs we historically have used leases with variable cam provisions that adjust to reflect inflationary increases we have made a concerted effort to convert our leases to a fixed payment methodology which fixes our tenants cam contributions and should in turn reduce the volatility of and limitations on the recoveries we collect from our tenants for the reimbursement of our property operating expenses however with respect to both variable and fixed payment methodologies the amount of cam charges we bill to our tenants may not allow us to recover all of these operating costs 

we face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably 

our properties compete with other retail properties and other forms of retailing such as catalogs and ecommerce websites competition may come from regional malls outlet centers communitylifestyle centers and other shopping centers both existing as well as future development projects the presence of competitive alternatives affects our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain new construction renovations and expansions at competing sites could also negatively affect our properties 

we also compete with other retail property developers to acquire prime development sites in addition we compete with other retail property companies for tenants and qualified management 

our international expansion may subject us to different or greater risk from those associated with our domestic operations 

we hold interests in joint venture properties that operate in italy japan korea and mexico and an interest in a joint venture property under development in malaysia we have a minority investment in two uk real estate companies we may pursue additional expansion opportunities outside the united states international development and ownership activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our domestic properties and operations these risks include 

• adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies • changes in foreign political and economic environments regionally nationally and locally • challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws including corporate governance operations taxes and litigation • differing lending practices • differences in cultures • changes in applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect foreign operations • difficulties in managing international operations and • obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash although our international activities currently are a relatively small portion of our business international properties represented approximately 50 of the gla of all of our properties at december 31 2010 to the extent 

that we expand our international activities these risks could increase in significance which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance 

we maintain insurance coverage with third party carriers who provide a portion of the coverage for specific layers of potential losses including commercial general liability fire flood extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties in the united states the initial portion of coverage not provided by third party carriers is either insured through our whollyowned captive insurance companies rosewood indemnity ltd and bridgewood insurance company ltd and other financial arrangements controlled by us the third party carrier has in turn agreed to provide evidence of coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carriers policy a similar policy written through our captive insurance entities also provides initial coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal windstorm locations 

there are some types of losses including lease and other contract claims which generally are not insured if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue it could generate 

we currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the united states on an all risk basis in the amount of up to 1 billion the current federal laws which provide this coverage are expected to operate through 2014 despite the existence of this insurance coverage any threatened or actual terrorist attacks where we operate could adversely affect our property values revenues consumer traffic and tenant sales 

risks relating to federal income taxes 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the internal revenue code we believe we have been organized and operated in a manner which allows us to qualify for taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code we intend to continue to operate in this manner however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the internal revenue code reit qualification is governed by highly technical and complex provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

if we fail to comply with those provisions we may be subject to monetary penalties or ultimately to possible disqualification as a reit if such events occurs and if available relief provisions do not apply 

• we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income • we will be subject to corporate level income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and • unless entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions we will also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost

for a description of our operational strategies and developments in our business during 2009 see the managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of the 2009 annual report to shareholders filed as exhibit 131 to this form 10k 

other policies 

the following is a discussion of our investment policies financing policies conflict of interest policies and policies with respect to certain other activities one or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote 

investment policies 

while we emphasize equity real estate investments we may at our discretion invest in mortgages and other real estate interests consistent with our qualification as a reit we do not currently intend to invest to a significant extent in mortgages or deeds of trust however we hold a mortgage note which results in us receiving 100 of the economics of a property we may invest in participating or convertible mortgages if we conclude that we may benefit from the cash flow or any appreciation in the value of the property 

we may invest in securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers however any of these investments would be subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for reit qualification these reit limitations mean that we cannot make an investment that would cause our real estate assets to be less than 75 of our total assets in addition at least 75 of our gross income must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including rents from real property dividends from other reits and in certain circumstances interest from certain types of temporary investments at least 95 of our income must be derived from such real property investments and from dividends interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing 

subject to reit limitations we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate such an investment would normally be in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties we may in the future acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies 

financing policies 

we must comply with the covenants contained in our financing agreements that limit our ratio of debt to total assets or market value as defined for example the operating partnerships lines of credit and the indentures for the operating partnerships debt securities contain covenants that restrict the total amount of debt of the operating partnership to 65 or 60 in relation to certain debt of total assets as defined under the related arrangement and secured debt to 50 of total assets in addition these agreements contain other covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios furthermore the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for our equity securities and the debt securities of the operating partnership 

if our board of directors determines to seek additional capital we may raise such capital through additional equity offerings debt financing creating joint ventures with existing ownership interests in properties retention of cash flows or a combination of these methods our ability to retain cash flows is limited by the requirement for reits to distribute at least 90 of their taxable income we must also take into account taxes that would be imposed on undistributed taxable income if the board of directors determines to raise additional equity capital it may without stockholder approval issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock the board of directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate such securities may be senior to the outstanding classes of common stock such securities also may include additional classes of preferred stock which may be convertible into common stock existing stockholders have no preemptive right to purchase shares in any subsequent offering of our securities any such offering could dilute a stockholders investment in us 

we expect most future borrowings would be made through the operating partnership or its subsidiaries we might however incur borrowings that would be reloaned to the operating partnership borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings publicly and privately placed debt instruments or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties any such indebtedness may be secured or unsecured any such indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to the borrower or crosscollateralized with other debt or may be fully or partially guaranteed by the operating partnership although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends we currently have no expectation that we will regularly be required to do so 

on december 8 2009 the operating partnership entered into a new 3565 billion unsecured revolving corporate credit facility which replaced its 35 billion unsecured credit facility or the credit facility which expired on january 11 2010 the new credit facility contains an accordion feature allowing the maximum borrowing capacity to expand to 40 billion the new credit facility matures on march 31 2013 we issue debt securities through the operating partnership but we may issue our debt securities which may be convertible into capital stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase capital stock we also may sell or securitize our lease receivables the proceeds from any borrowings or financings may be used for one or more of the following 

• financing acquisitions • developing or redeveloping properties • refinancing existing indebtedness • working capital or capital improvements or • meeting the income distribution requirements applicable to reits if we have income without the receipt of cash sufficient to enable us to meet such distribution requirements we may also finance acquisitions through the following 

• issuance of shares of common stock or preferred stock • issuance of additional units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership • issuance of preferred units of the operating partnership • issuance of other securities or • sale or exchange of ownership interests in properties the ability of the operating partnership to issue units of limited partnership interest to transferors of properties or other partnership interests may defer gain recognition for tax purposes by the transferor it may also be advantageous for us since there are ownership limits that restrict the number of shares of our capital stock that investors may own 

we do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property mortgage financing instruments however usually limit additional indebtedness on such properties we also have covenants on our unsecured debt that limit our total secured debt 

typically we invest in or form special purpose entities to assist us in obtaining permanent financing at attractive terms permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage loan on a single property or on a group of properties and generally requires us to provide a mortgage interest on the property in favor of an institutional third party as a joint venture with a third party or as a securitized financing for securitized financings we create special purpose entities to own the properties these special purpose entities are structured so that they would not be consolidated with us in the event we would ever become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding we decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives for accounting purposes we include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness 

conflict of interest policies 

we maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest we have adopted governance principles governing our affairs and the board of directors as well as written charters for each of the standing committees of the board of directors in addition we have a code of business conduct and ethics which applies to all of our officers directors and employees at least a majority of the members of our board of directors must qualify as independent under the listing standards for new york stock exchange companies and cannot be affiliated with the simon family who are significant stockholders andor unitholders in the operating partnership any transaction between us and the simons including property acquisitions service and property management agreements and retail space leases must be approved by a majority of our nonaffiliated directors 

the sale by the operating partnership of any property that it owns may have an adverse tax impact on the simons and the other limited partners of the operating partnership in order to avoid any conflict of interest between simon property and the limited partners of the operating partnership our charter requires that at least six of our independent directors must authorize and require the operating partnership to sell any property it owns any such sale is subject to applicable agreements with third parties noncompetition agreements executed by each of the simons contain covenants limiting the ability of the simons to participate in certain shopping center activities in north america 

policies with respect to certain other activities 

we intend to make investments which are consistent with our qualification as a reit unless the board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to so qualify as a reit the board of directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the reit requirements we have authority to offer shares of our capital stock or other securities in exchange for property we also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities we may issue shares of our common stock or cash at our option to holders of units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership in future periods upon exercise of such holders rights under the operating partnership agreement our policy prohibits us from making any loans to our directors or executive officers for any purpose we may make loans to the joint ventures in which we participate 

competition 

the retail industry is dynamic and competitive we compete with numerous merchandise distribution channels including regional malls outlet centers communitylifestyle centers and other shopping centers in the united states and abroad internet retailing sites and catalogs also provide retailers with distribution options beyond existing brick and mortar retail properties and the numerous projects in development by commercial developers real estate companies and other owners of retail real estate the existence of competitive alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we can obtain this results in competition for both the tenants to occupy the properties that we develop and manage as well as for the acquisition of prime sites including 

land for development and operating properties we believe that there are numerous factors that make our properties highly desirable to retailers including

 item 1a risk factors 

  the following factors among others could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time these factors among others may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows and you should carefully consider them it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties and we may update them in our future periodic reports 

risks relating to debt and the financial markets 

we have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations 

as of december 31 2009 our consolidated mortgages and other indebtedness excluding the related premium and discount totaled 186 billion we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the property such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants cause a reduction in the income from the property should such events occur our operations may be adversely affected if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from this is insufficient to pay that indebtedness the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value 

disruption in the credit markets or downgrades in our credit ratings may adversely affect our ability to access external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements 

we depend primarily on external financings principally debt financings to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt our access to financing depends on our credit rating the willingness of banks to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature or that the financing available to us will be on acceptable terms 

adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

our outstanding senior unsecured notes and preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and the economic outlook in general our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund our growth adverse changes in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our future growth 

our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk 

we manage our exposure to interest rate risk by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of our variable rate debt in addition we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and terms are appropriate our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful 

our use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs 

factors affecting real estate investments and operations 

we face risks associated with the acquisition development and expansion of properties 

we regularly acquire and develop new properties and expand and redevelop existing properties and these activities are subject to various risks we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition development or redevelopmentexpansion opportunities in addition newly acquired developed or redevelopedexpanded properties may not perform 

as well as expected we are subject to other risks in connection with any acquisition development and redevelopmentexpansion activities including the following 

• construction costs of a project may be higher than projected potentially making the project unfeasible or unprofitable • we may not be able to obtain financing or to refinance construction loans on favorable terms if at all • we may be unable to obtain zoning occupancy or other governmental approvals • occupancy rates and rents may not meet our projections and the project may not be profitable and • we may need the consent of third parties such as anchor tenants mortgage lenders and joint venture partners and those consents may be withheld if a development or redevelopmentexpansion project is unsuccessful either because it is not meeting our expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project planning we could lose our investment in the project further if we guarantee the propertys financing our loss could exceed our investment in the project 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid 

our properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets these investments are relatively illiquid as a result our ability to sell one or more of our properties or investments in real estate in response to any changes in economic or other conditions is limited if we want to sell a property we cannot assure you that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or that the sales price of a property will exceed the cost of our investment 

environmental risks 

as owners of real estate we can face liabilities for environmental contamination 

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require us as a current or previous owner or operator of real property to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at a property or at impacted neighboring properties these laws often impose liability regardless of whether the property owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances these laws and regulations may require the abatement or removal of asbestos containing materials in the event of damage demolition or renovation reconstruction or expansion of a property and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air those laws and regulations also govern the installation maintenance and removal of underground storage tanks used to store waste oils or other petroleum products many of our properties contain or at one time contained asbestos containing materials or underground storage tanks primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition but is not estimable the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may also adversely affect our ability to sell lease or redevelop a property or to borrow using a property as collateral 

our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful 

although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances this belief is based on limited testing nearly all of our properties have been subjected to phase i or similar environmental audits these environmental audits have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition however we cannot assure you that 

• existing environmental studies with respect to the portfolio reveal all potential environmental liabilities • any previous owner occupant or tenant of a property did not create any material environmental condition not known to us • the current environmental condition of the portfolio will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by other unrelated third parties or • future uses or conditions including without limitation changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof will not result in environmental liabilities 9 

retail operations risks 

ongoing economic conditions are adversely affecting the general retail environment 

our concentration in the retail real estate market means that we are subject to the risks that affect the retail environment generally including the levels of consumer spending seasonality the willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers tenant bankruptcies changes in economic conditions consumer confidence and terrorist activities the economy appears to be recovering from the recent recession during which consumer spending in the united states declined significantly the unemployment rate remains relatively high and consumer confidence remains relatively depressed we derive our cash flow from operations primarily from retail tenants many of whom are currently under considerable economic stress a significant deterioration in our cash flow from operations could require us to curtail planned capital expenditures or seek alternative sources of financing 

we may not be able to lease newly developed properties and renew leases and relet space at existing properties 

we may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants or for rents that are consistent with our projections also when leases for our existing properties expire the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms to the extent that our leasing plans are not achieved our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures could be adversely affected 

some of our properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of or a store closure by one or more of these tenants 

regional malls are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally recognized tenants the value of some of our properties could be adversely affected if these tenants fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations department store and larger store also referred to as big box consolidations typically result in the closure of existing stores or duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations we do not control the disposition of those department stores or larger stores that we do not own we also may not control the vacant space that is not released in those stores we do own other tenants may be entitled to modify the terms of their existing leases in the event of such closures the modification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and could decrease rents or expense recovery charges additionally major tenant closures may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sales at other stores if the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to closing of anchors economic conditions or other reasons tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges in the event of default by a tenant or anchor store we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with those parties 

we face potential adverse effects from the increasing number of tenant bankruptcies 

although bankruptcy filings by retailers occur regularly in the course of our operations the number of tenant bankruptcies has increased in the past two years we continually seek to release vacant spaces resulting from tenant terminations the bankruptcy of a tenant particularly an anchor tenant may make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the affected properties future tenant bankruptcies could adversely affect our properties or impact our ability to successfully execute our releasing strategy 

risks relating to joint venture properties 

we have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance them 

as of december 31 2009 we owned interests in 182 incomeproducing properties with other parties of those 18 properties are included in our consolidated financial statements we account for the other 164 properties under the equity method of accounting which we refer to as joint venture properties we serve as general partner or property manager for 93 of these 164 properties however certain major decisions such as selling or refinancing these properties require the consent of the other owners of the properties for which we do not serve as general partner or property manager 61 are in our international joint ventures the other owners also have other participating rights that we consider substantive for purposes of determining control over the properties assets the remaining joint venture 

properties are managed by third parties these limitations may adversely affect our ability to sell refinance or otherwise operate these properties 

the operating partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties 

joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property as of december 31 2009 the operating partnership has loan guarantees to support 472 million of our total 65 billion share of joint venture mortgage and other indebtedness a default by a joint venture under its debt obligations may expose us to liability under a guaranty or letter of credit 

other factors affecting our business 

our common area maintenance cam contributions may not allow us to recover the majority of our operating expenses from tenants 

cam costs typically include allocable energy costs repairs maintenance and capital improvements to common areas janitorial services administrative property and liability insurance costs and security costs we historically have used leases with variable cam provisions that adjust to reflect inflationary increases we have made a concerted effort to convert our leases to a fixed payment methodology which fixes our tenants cam contributions and should in turn reduce the volatility of and limitations on the recoveries we collect from our tenants for the reimbursement of our property operating expenses however with respect to both variable and fixed payment methodologies the amount of cam charges we bill to our tenants may not allow us to recover all of these operating costs 

we face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably 

our properties compete with other retail properties and other forms of retailing such as catalogs and ecommerce websites competition may come from regional malls outlet centers communitylifestyle centers and other shopping centers both existing as well as future development projects the presence of competitive alternatives affects our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain renovations and expansions at competing sites could also negatively affect our properties 

we also compete with other retail property developers to acquire prime development sites in addition we compete with other retail property companies for tenants and qualified management 

our international expansion may subject us to different or greater risk from those associated with our domestic operations 

we hold interests in joint venture properties that operate in italy france poland japan korea and mexico and we have a minority investment in common shares of a uk retail real estate company we may pursue additional expansion opportunities outside the united states international development and ownership activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our domestic properties and operations these risks include 

• adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies • changes in foreign political and economic environments regionally nationally and locally • challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws including corporate governance operations taxes and litigation • differing lending practices • differences in cultures • changes in applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect foreign operations • difficulties in managing international operations and • obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash although our international activities currently are a relatively small portion of our business international properties represented approximately 63 of the gla of all of our properties at december 31 2009 to the extent that we expand our international activities these risks could increase in significance which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance 

we maintain commercial general liability fire flood extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties in the united states through whollyowned captive insurance entities and other selfinsurance mechanisms rosewood indemnity ltd and bridgewood insurance company ltd are our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiaries and have agreed to indemnify our general liability carrier for a specific layer of losses for the properties that are covered under these arrangements the carrier has in turn agreed to provide evidence of coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carriers policy a similar policy written through these captive insurance entities also provides initial coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal windstorm locations 

there are some types of losses including lease and other contract claims that generally are not insured if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property if this happens we may still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 

we currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the united states on an all risk basis in the amount of up to 1 billion per occurrence for certified foreign acts of terrorism and 500 million per occurrence for noncertified domestic acts of terrorism the current federal laws which provide this coverage are expected to operate through 2014 despite the existence of this insurance coverage any threatened or actual terrorist attacks in high profile markets could adversely affect our property values revenues consumer traffic and tenant sales 

risks relating to federal income taxes 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the internal revenue code we believe we have been organized and operated in a manner which allows us to qualify for taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code we intend to continue to operate in this manner however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the internal revenue code reit qualification is governed by highly technical and complex provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

if we fail to comply with those provisions we may be subject to monetary penalties or ultimately to possible disqualification as a reit if such events occurs and if available relief provisions do not apply 

• we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income • we will be subject to corporate level income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and • unless entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions we will also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost

other policies 

the following is a discussion of our investment policies financing policies conflict of interest policies and policies with respect to certain other activities one or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote 

investment policies 

while we emphasize equity real estate investments we may at our discretion invest in mortgages and other real estate interests consistent with our qualification as a reit we do not currently intend to invest to a significant extent in mortgages or deeds of trust however we hold a mortgage note which results in us receiving 100 of the economics of a property we may invest in participating or convertible mortgages if we conclude that we may benefit from the cash flow or any appreciation in the value of the property 

we may invest in securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers however any of these investments would be subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for reit qualification these reit limitations mean that we cannot make an investment that would cause our real estate assets to be less than 75 of our total assets in addition at least 75 of our gross income must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including rents from real property dividends from other reits and in certain circumstances interest from certain types of temporary investments at least 95 of our income must be derived from such real property investments and from dividends interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing 

subject to reit limitations we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate such an investment would normally be in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties we may in the future acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies 

financing policies 

we must comply with the covenants contained in our financing agreements that limit our ratio of debt to total assets or market value as defined for example the operating partnerships lines of credit and the indentures for the operating partnerships debt securities contain covenants that restrict the total amount of debt of the operating partnership to 65 or 60 in relation to certain debt of total assets as defined under the related arrangement and secured debt to 50 of total assets in addition these agreements contain other covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios furthermore the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for our equity securities and the debt securities of the operating partnership 

if our board of directors determines to seek additional capital we may raise such capital through additional equity offerings debt financing creating joint ventures with existing ownership interests in properties retention of cash flows or a combination of these methods our ability to retain cash flows is limited by the requirement for reits to distribute at least 90 of their taxable income we must also take into account taxes that would be imposed on undistributed taxable income if the board of directors determines to raise additional equity capital it may without stockholder approval issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock the board of directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate such securities may be senior to the outstanding classes of common stock such securities also may include additional classes of preferred stock which may be convertible into common stock existing stockholders have no preemptive right to purchase shares in any subsequent offering of our securities any such offering could dilute a stockholders investment in us 

we expect most future borrowings would be made through the operating partnership or its subsidiaries we might however incur borrowings that would be reloaned to the operating partnership borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings publicly and privately placed debt instruments or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties any such indebtedness may be secured or unsecured any such indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to the borrower or crosscollateralized with other debt or may be fully or partially guaranteed by the operating partnership although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends we currently have no expectation that we will regularly be required to do so 

the operating partnership has a 35 billion revolving unsecured credit facility or the credit facility we issue debt securities through the operating partnership but we may issue our debt securities which may be convertible into capital stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase capital stock we also may sell or securitize our lease receivables the proceeds from any borrowings or financings may be used for one or more of the following 

• financing acquisitions • developing or redeveloping properties • refinancing existing indebtedness • working capital or capital improvements or • meeting the income distribution requirements applicable to reits if we have income without the receipt of cash sufficient to enable us to meet such distribution requirements we may also finance acquisitions through the following 

• issuance of shares of common stock or preferred stock • issuance of additional units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership • issuance of preferred units of the operating partnership • issuance of other securities or • sale or exchange of ownership interests in properties the ability of the operating partnership to issue units of limited partnership interest to transferors of properties or other partnership interests may defer gain recognition for tax purposes by the transferor it may also be advantageous for us since there are ownership limits that restrict the number of shares of our capital stock that investors may own 

we do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property mortgage financing instruments however usually limit additional indebtedness on such properties we also have covenants on our unsecured debt that limit our total secured debt 

typically we invest in or form special purpose entities to assist us in obtaining permanent financing on attractive terms permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage loan on a single property or on a group of properties and generally requires us to provide a mortgage interest on the property in favor of an institutional third party as a joint venture with a third party or as a securitized financing for securitized financings we create special purpose entities to own the properties these special purpose entities are structured so that they would not be consolidated with us in the event we would ever become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding we decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives for accounting purposes we include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness 

conflict of interest policies 

we maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest we have adopted governance principles governing our affairs and the board of directors as well as written charters for each of the standing committees of the board of directors in addition we have a code of business conduct and ethics which applies to all of our officers directors and employees at least a majority of the members of our board of directors must qualify as independent under the listing standards for new york stock exchange companies and cannot be affiliated with the simon family who are significant stockholders any transaction between us and the simons including property acquisitions service and property management agreements and retail space leases must be approved by a majority of our nonaffiliated directors 

the sale by the operating partnership of any property that it owns may have an adverse tax impact on the simons and the other limited partners of the operating partnership in order to avoid any conflict of interest between simon property and the limited partners of the operating partnership our charter requires that at least six of our independent directors must authorize and require the operating partnership to sell any property it owns any such sale is subject to applicable agreements with third parties noncompetition agreements executed by each of the simons contain covenants limiting the ability of the simons to participate in certain shopping center activities in north america 

policies with respect to certain other activities 

we intend to make investments which are consistent with our qualification as a reit unless the board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to so qualify as a reit the board of directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the reit requirements we have authority to offer shares of our capital stock or other securities in exchange for property we also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities we may issue shares of our common stock or cash at our option to holders of units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership in future periods upon exercise of such holders rights under the operating partnership agreement our policy prohibits us from making any loans to our directors or executive officers for any purpose we may make loans to the joint ventures in which we participate 

competition 

our principal competitors are nine other major united states or internationally publiclyheld companies that own or operate regional malls outlet centers and other shopping centers in the united states and abroad we also compete with many commercial developers real estate companies and other owners of retail real estate that operate in our trade areas some of our properties and investments are of the same type and are within the same market area as competitor properties the existence of competitive properties could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we can obtain this results in competition for both the acquisition of prime sites including land for development and operating properties and for tenants to occupy the space that we and our competitors develop and manage in addition our properties compete against other forms of retailing such as catalog and ecommerce websites that offer retail products and services 

we believe that we have a competitive advantage in the retail real estate business as a result of 

• the size quality and diversity of our properties • our management and operational expertise • our extensive experience and relationships with retailers and lenders • our mall marketing initiatives and consumer focused strategic corporate alliances and 5 

• our ability to use our size to reduce the total occupancy cost of our tenants our size reduces our dependence upon individual retail tenants approximately 4300 different retailers occupy more than 28600 stores in our properties and no retail tenant represents more than 20 of our properties total minimum rents

• issued 4353882 shares of common stock upon the exchange of units of limited partnership interest of the operating partnership or units • issued 914695 restricted shares of common stock net of forfeitures under the simon property group 1998 stock incentive plan • issued 927790 shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options under 1998 plan • purchased and retired 93000 shares of common stock • purchased 572000 shares of common stock in the open market • issued 5426696 shares of common stock upon the conversion of 6786886 shares of series i preferred stock • redeemed all of the outstanding 8000000 shares of series f preferred stock • redeemed all of the outstanding 3000000 shares of series g preferred stock • issued 541976 shares of series i preferred stock upon the exchange of series i preferred units • issued 4000 shares of common stock upon conversion and retirement of all 4000 shares of class c common stock • borrowed a maximum amount of 26 billion under our the credit facility the outstanding amount of borrowings under this facility as of december 31 2008 was 10 billion • as a coborrower with the operating partnership borrowed 18 billion under an unsecured acquisition facility in connection with our acquisition of the former chelsea property group in 2004 that was fully repaid as of december 31 2006 • provided annual reports containing financial statements certified by our independent registered public accounting firm and quarterly reports containing unaudited financial statements to our security holders • not made loans to other entities or persons including our officers and directors other than to certain joint venture properties • not invested in the securities of other issuers for the purpose of exercising control other than the operating partnership certain whollyowned subsidiaries and to acquire interests in real estate • not underwritten securities of other issuers and • not engaged in the purchase and sale or turnover of investments for the purpose of trading employees

 item 1a risk factors 

  the following factors among others could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time these factors among others may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows and you should carefully consider them it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties and we may update them in our future periodic reports 

risks relating to debt and the financial markets 

we have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations 

as of december 31 2008 our consolidated mortgages and other indebtedness excluding the related premium and discount totaled 180 billion of which approximately 15 billion matures during 2009 including recurring principal amortization on mortgages maturing during 2009 we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the property such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants cause a reduction in the income from the property should such events occur our operations may be adversely affected if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from this is insufficient to pay that indebtedness the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value 

the ongoing disruption in the credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements 

we depend primarily on external financings principally debt financings to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt our access to financing depends on our credit rating the willingness of banks to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets the disruption in the capital markets that began in 2008 has continued into 2009 restricting access to capital markets for many companies we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature or that the financing available to us will be on acceptable terms 

adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

our outstanding senior unsecured notes and preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and the economic outlook in general our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund our growth adverse changes in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our future growth 

our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk 

we manage our exposure to interest rate risk by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of our variable rate debt or in the case of a fair value hedge effectively convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt in addition we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and terms are appropriate our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful 

our use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs 

factors affecting real estate investments and operations 

we face risks associated with the acquisition development and expansion of properties 

we regularly acquire and develop new properties and expand and redevelop existing properties and these activities are subject to various risks we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition development or redevelopmentexpansion opportunities in addition newly acquired developed or redevelopedexpanded properties may not perform as well as expected we are subject to other risks in connection with any acquisition development and redevelopmentexpansion activities including the following 

• construction costs of a project may be higher than projected potentially making the project unfeasible or unprofitable • we may not be able to obtain financing or to refinance construction loans on favorable terms if at all • we may be unable to obtain zoning occupancy or other governmental approvals • occupancy rates and rents may not meet our projections and the project may not be profitable and • we may need the consent of third parties such as anchor tenants mortgage lenders and joint venture partners and those consents may be withheld if a development or redevelopmentexpansion project is unsuccessful either because it is not meeting our expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project planning we could lose our investment in the project further if we guarantee the propertys financing our loss could exceed our investment in the project 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid 

our properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets these investments are relatively illiquid as a result our ability to sell one or more of our properties or investments in real estate in response to any changes in economic or other conditions is limited if we want to sell a property we cannot assure you that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or that the sales price of a property will exceed the cost of our investment 

environmental risks 

as owners of real estate we can face liabilities for environmental contamination 

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require us as a current or previous owner or operator of real property to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at a property or at impacted neighboring properties these laws often impose liability regardless of whether the property owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances these laws and regulations may require the abatement or removal of asbestos containing materials in the event of damage demolition or renovation reconstruction or expansion of a property and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air those laws and regulations also govern the installation maintenance and removal of underground storage tanks used to store waste oils or other petroleum products many of our properties contain or at one time contained asbestos containing materials or underground storage tanks primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition but is not estimable the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may also adversely affect our ability to sell lease or redevelop a property or to borrow using a property as collateral 

our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful 

although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances this belief is based on limited testing nearly all of our properties have been subjected to phase i or similar environmental audits these environmental audits have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition however we cannot assure you that 

• existing environmental studies with respect to the portfolio reveal all potential environmental liabilities • any previous owner occupant or tenant of a property did not create any material environmental condition not known to us 9 

• the current environmental condition of the portfolio will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by other unrelated third parties or • future uses or conditions including without limitation changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof will not result in environmental liabilities retail operations risks 

deteriorating economic conditions are adversely affecting the general retail environment 

our concentration in the retail real estate market means that we are subject to the risks that affect the retail environment generally including the levels of consumer spending seasonality the willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers tenant bankruptcies changes in economic conditions consumer confidence and terrorist activities a recession is currently affecting the economy and consumer spending in the united states has recently declined the unemployment rate is rising and consumer confidence has decreased significantly in addition we derive our cash flow from operations primarily from retail tenants many of whom are currently under considerable economic stress a prolonged recession is likely to adversely affect our tenants and as a result this could affect our results of operations and financial condition a significant deterioration in our cash flow from operations could require us to curtail planned capital expenditures or seek alternative sources of financing 

we may not be able to lease newly developed properties and renew leases and relet space at existing properties 

we may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants or for rents that are consistent with our projections also when leases for our existing properties expire the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms to the extent that our leasing plans are not achieved our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures could be adversely affected 

some of our properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of or a store closure by one or more of these tenants 

regional malls are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally recognized tenants the value of some of our properties could be adversely affected if these tenants fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations department store and larger store also referred to as big box consolidations typically result in the closure of existing stores or duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations we do not control the disposition of those department stores or larger stores that we do not own we also may not control the vacant space that is not released in those stores we do own other tenants may be entitled to modify the terms of their existing leases in the event of such closures the modification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and could decrease rents or expense recovery charges additionally major tenant closures may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sales at other stores if the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to closing of anchors economic conditions or other reasons tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges in the event of default by a tenant or anchor store we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with those parties 

we face potential adverse effects from the increasing number of tenant bankruptcies 

although bankruptcy filings by retailers occur regularly in the course of our operations the number of tenant bankruptcies has increased substantially in the past twelve months we continually seek to release vacant spaces resulting from tenant terminations the bankruptcy of a tenant particularly an anchor tenant may make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the affected properties future tenant bankruptcies could adversely affect our properties or impact our ability to successfully execute our releasing strategy 

risks relating to joint venture properties 

we have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance them 

as of december 31 2008 we owned interests in 183 incomeproducing properties with other parties of those 18 properties are included in our consolidated financial statements we account for the other 165 properties under the 

equity method of accounting which we refer to as joint venture properties we serve as general partner or property manager for 93 of these 165 properties however certain major decisions such as selling or refinancing these properties require the consent of the other owners of the properties for which we do not serve as general partner or property manager 62 are in our international joint ventures the other owners also have other participating rights that we consider substantive for purposes of determining control over the properties assets the remaining joint venture properties are managed by third parties these limitations may adversely affect our ability to sell refinance or otherwise operate these properties 

the operating partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties 

joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property as of december 31 2008 the operating partnership has loan guarantees and other guarantee obligations to support 719 million and 66 million respectively of our total 66 billion share of joint venture mortgage and other indebtedness a default by a joint venture under its debt obligations may expose us to liability under a guaranty or letter of credit 

other factors affecting our business 

our common area maintenance cam contributions may not allow us to recover the majority of our operating expenses from tenants 

cam costs typically include allocable energy costs repairs maintenance and capital improvements to common areas janitorial services administrative property and liability insurance costs and security costs we historically have used leases with variable cam provisions that adjust to reflect inflationary increases recently we have made a concerted effort to convert our leases to a fixed payment methodology which fixes our tenants cam contributions and should in turn reduce the volatility of and limitations on the recoveries we collect from our tenants for the reimbursement of our property operating expenses however with respect to both variable and fixed payment methodologies the amount of cam charges we bill to our tenants may not allow us to recover all of these operating costs 

we face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably 

our properties compete with other retail properties for tenants on the basis of the rent charged and location the principal competition may come from existing or future developments in the same market areas and from discount shopping centers outlet malls catalogues discount shopping clubs and electronic commerce the presence of competitive properties also affects our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain renovations and expansions at competing malls could also negatively affect our properties 

we also compete with other retail property developers to acquire prime development sites in addition we compete with other retail property companies for tenants and qualified management 

our international expansion may subject us to different or greater risk from those associated with our domestic operations 

we hold interests in joint venture properties that are under operation in italy france poland japan korea mexico and china and we have recently made an investment in a uk retail real estate company we may pursue additional expansion opportunities outside the united states international development and ownership activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our domestic properties and operations these risks include 

• adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies • changes in foreign political and economic environments regionally nationally and locally • challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws including corporate governance operations taxes and litigation • differing lending practices • differences in cultures • changes in applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect foreign operations • difficulties in managing international operations and • obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash 11 

although our international activities currently are a relatively small portion of our business international properties represented approximately 63 of the gla of all of our properties at december 31 2008 to the extent that we expand our international activities these risks could increase in significance which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance 

we maintain commercial general liability fire flood extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties in the united states through whollyowned captive insurance entities and other selfinsurance mechanisms rosewood indemnity ltd and bridgewood insurance company ltd are our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiaries and have agreed to indemnify our general liability carrier for a specific layer of losses for the properties that are covered under these arrangements the carrier has in turn agreed to provide evidence of coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carriers policy a similar policy written through these captive insurance entities also provides initial coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal windstorm locations 

there are some types of losses including lease and other contract claims that generally are not insured if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property if this happens we may still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 

we currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the united states on an all risk basis in the amount of up to 1 billion per occurrence for certified foreign acts of terrorism and 500 million per occurrence for noncertified domestic acts of terrorism the current federal laws which provide this coverage are expected to operate through 2014 despite the existence of this insurance coverage any threatened or actual terrorist attacks in high profile markets could adversely affect our property values revenues consumer traffic and tenant sales 

risks relating to federal income taxes 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the internal revenue code we believe we have been organized and operated in a manner which allows us to qualify for taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code we intend to continue to operate in this manner however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the internal revenue code reit qualification is governed by highly technical and complex provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

if we fail to comply with those provisions we may be subject to monetary penalties or ultimately to possible disqualification as a reit if such events occurs and if available relief provisions do not apply 

• we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income • we will be subject to corporate level income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and • unless entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions we will also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost 12

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  as previously disclosed for several years we have been defending actions brought by the attorneys general of massachusetts new hampshire and connecticut in their respective state courts and similar litigation brought by other parties alleging that the sale of cobranded bankissued gift cards by our affiliate spggc inc at certain of our properties violated state gift certificate and consumer protection laws we previously reported the dismissal of the new hampshire litigation during the fourth quarter of 2008 the complaint in the massachusetts litigation was dismissed and we settled the connecticut litigation the only remaining legal proceedings involving gift card sales are two purported class actions brought by private parties in new york with the resolution of the remaining attorneys generals actions in 2008 we no longer believe that the ultimate outcome of these related actions would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows and accordingly we do not expect to report further developments in these actions 

  we are also involved in various other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business we believe that such litigation claims and administrative proceedings will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or our results of operations we record a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated

other policies 

the following is a discussion of our investment policies financing policies conflict of interest policies and policies with respect to certain other activities one or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote 

investment policies 

while we emphasize equity real estate investments we may at our discretion invest in mortgages and other real estate interests consistent with our qualification as a reit we do not currently intend to invest to a significant extent in mortgages or deeds of trust however we hold an interest in one property through a mortgage note which results in us receiving 100 of the economics of the property we may invest in participating or convertible mortgages if we conclude that we may benefit from the cash flow or any appreciation in the value of the property 

we may invest in securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers however any of these investments would be subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for reit qualification these reit limitations mean that we cannot make an investment that would cause our real estate assets to be less than 75 of our total assets in addition at least 75 of our gross income must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including rents from real property dividends from other reits and in certain circumstances interest from certain types of temporary investments at least 95 of our income must be derived from such real property investments and from dividends interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing 

subject to reit limitations we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate such an investment would normally be in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties we may in the future acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies 

financing policies 

we must comply with the covenants contained in our financing agreements that limit our ratio of debt to total asset or market value as defined for example the operating partnerships lines of credit and the indentures for the 

operating partnerships debt securities contain covenants that restrict the total amount of debt of the operating partnership to 65 or 60 in relation to certain debt of total assets as defined under the related arrangement and secured debt to 50 of total assets in addition these agreements contain other covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios furthermore the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for our equity securities and the debt securities of the operating partnership 

if our board of directors determines to seek additional capital we may raise such capital through additional equity offerings debt financing creating joint ventures with existing ownership interests in properties retention of cash flows or a combination of these methods our ability to retain cash flows is limited by the requirement for reits to distribute at least 90 of their taxable income we must also take into account taxes that would be imposed on undistributed taxable income if the board of directors determines to raise additional equity capital it may without stockholder approval issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock the board of directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate this may include issuing stock in exchange for property such securities may be senior to the outstanding classes of common stock such securities also may include additional classes of preferred stock which may be convertible into common stock existing stockholders have no preemptive right to purchase shares in any subsequent offering of our securities any such offering could dilute a stockholders investment in us 

we expect most additional borrowings would be made through the operating partnership or its subsidiaries we might however incur borrowings that would be reloaned to the operating partnership borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings publicly and privately placed debt instruments or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties any such indebtedness may be secured or unsecured any such indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to the borrower or crosscollateralized with other debt or may be fully or partially guaranteed by the operating partnership although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends we currently have no expectation that we will regularly be required to do so 

we have a 35 billion revolving unsecured credit facility we issue debt securities through the operating partnership but we may issue our debt securities which may be convertible into capital stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase capital stock we also may sell or securitize our lease receivables the proceeds from any borrowings or financings may be used for one or more of the following 

• financing acquisitions • developing or redeveloping properties • refinancing existing indebtedness • working capital or capital improvements or • meeting the income distribution requirements applicable to reits if we have income without the receipt of cash sufficient to enable us to meet such distribution requirements we may also finance acquisitions through the following 

• issuance of shares of common stock or preferred stock • issuance of additional units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership • issuance of preferred units of the operating partnership • issuance of other securities or • sale or exchange of ownership interests in properties the ability of the operating partnership to issue units of limited partnership interest to transferors of properties or other partnership interests may defer gain recognition for tax purposes by the transferor it may also be advantageous for us since there are ownership limits that restrict the number of shares of our capital stock that investors may own 

we do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property mortgage financing instruments however usually limit additional indebtedness on such properties we also have covenants on our unsecured debt that limit our total secured debt 

typically we invest in or form special purpose entities to assist us in obtaining permanent financing on attractive terms permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage loan on a single property or on a group of properties and generally requires us to provide a mortgage interest on the property in favor of an institutional third party as a joint venture with a third party or as a securitized financing for securitized financings we create special purpose entities to own the properties these special purpose entities are structured so that they would not be 

consolidated with us in the event we would ever become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding we decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives for accounting purposes we include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness 

conflict of interest policies 

we maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest we have adopted governance principles governing our affairs and the board of directors as well as written charters for each of the standing committees of the board of directors in addition we have a code of business conduct and ethics which applies to all of our officers directors and employees at least a majority of the members of our board of directors must qualify as independent under the listing standards for new york stock exchange companies and cannot be affiliated with the simon or debartolo families who are significant stockholders any transaction between us and the simons or the debartolos including property acquisitions service and property management agreements and retail space leases must be approved by a majority of our nonaffiliated directors 

the sale by the operating partnership of any property that it owns may have an adverse tax impact on the simons or the debartolos and the other limited partners of the operating partnership in order to avoid any conflict of interest between simon property and the limited partners of the operating partnership our charter requires that at least six of our independent directors must authorize and require the operating partnership to sell any property it owns any such sale is subject to applicable agreements with third parties noncompetition agreements executed by each of the simons contain covenants limiting the ability of the simons to participate in certain shopping center activities in north america 

policies with respect to certain other activities 

we intend to make investments which are consistent with our qualification as a reit unless the board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to so qualify as a reit the board of directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the reit requirements we have authority to offer shares of our capital stock or other securities in exchange for property we also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities we may issue shares of our common stock or cash at our option to holders of units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership in future periods upon exercise of such holders rights under the operating partnership agreement our policy prohibits us from making any loans to our directors or executive officers for any purpose we may make loans to the joint ventures in which we participate 

competition 

our principal competitors are nine other major united states or internationally publiclyheld companies that own or operate regional malls outlet centers and other shopping centers in the united states and abroad we also compete with many commercial developers real estate companies and other owners of retail real estate that operate in our trade areas some of our properties and investments are of the same type and are within the same market area as competitor properties the existence of competitive properties could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we can obtain this results in competition for both the acquisition of prime sites including land for development and operating properties and for tenants to occupy the space that we and our competitors develop and manage in addition our properties compete against other forms of retailing such as catalog and ecommerce websites that offer retail products and services 

we believe that we have a competitive advantage in the retail real estate business as a result of 

• the size quality and diversity of our properties • our management and operational expertise • our extensive experience and relationships with retailers and lenders • our mall marketing initiatives and consumer focused strategic corporate alliances and • our ability to use our size to reduce the total occupancy cost of our tenants our size reduces our dependence upon individual retail tenants approximately 5100 different retailers occupy more than 28600 stores in our properties and no retail tenant represents more than 21 of our properties total minimum rents 

certain activities 

during the past three years we have 

• issued 4060755 shares of common stock upon the conversion of common units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership • issued 1038364 restricted shares of common stock net of forfeitures under the simon property group 1998 stock incentive plan • issued 852148 shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options under 1998 plan • purchased and retired 111000 shares of common stock • purchased 3387400 shares of common stock in the open market • issued 274920 shares of common stock upon the conversion of 349814 shares of series i preferred stock • redeemed all of the outstanding 8000000 shares of series f preferred stock • redeemed all of the outstanding 3000000 shares of series g preferred stock • issued 716731 shares of series i preferred stock upon the exchange of series i preferred units • borrowed a maximum amount of 26 billion under our unsecured 35 billion credit facility the outstanding amount of borrowings under this facility as of december 31 2007 was 24 billion • as a coborrower with the operating partnership borrowed 18 billion under an unsecured acquisition facility in connection with our acquisition of the former chelsea property group in 2004 that was fully repaid as of december 31 2006 • provided annual reports containing financial statements certified by our independent registered public accounting firm and quarterly reports containing unaudited financial statements to our security holders • not made loans to other entities or persons including our officers and directors other than to certain joint venture properties • not invested in the securities of other issuers for the purpose of exercising control other than the operating partnership certain whollyowned subsidiaries and to acquire interests in real estate • not underwritten securities of other issuers and • not engaged in the purchase and sale or turnover of investments for the purpose of trading employees

 item 1a risk factors 

  the following factors among others could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time these factors among others may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows and you should carefully consider them it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties and we may update them in our future periodic reports 

risks relating to debt and the financial markets 

we have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations 

as of december 31 2007 our consolidated mortgages and other indebtedness excluding the related premium and discount totaled 172 billion of which approximately 751 million matures during 2008 including recurring principal amortization on mortgages maturing during 2007 we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the property such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants cause a reduction in the income from the property should such events occur our operations may be adversely affected if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from the is insufficient to pay that indebtedness the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value 

we depend on external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements 

we depend primarily on external financings principally debt financings to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt our access to financing depends on our credit rating the willingness of banks to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets which have experienced increasing volatility in recent months we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature or that the financing available to us will be on acceptable terms 

adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

our outstanding senior unsecured notes and preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and the economic outlook in general our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund our growth adverse changes in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our future growth 

our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk 

we manage our exposure to interest rate risk by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of our variable rate debt or in the case of a fair value hedge effectively convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt in addition we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and terms are appropriate our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful 

our use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs 

factors affecting real estate investments and operations 

we face risks associated with the acquisition development and expansion of properties 

we regularly acquire and develop new properties and expand and redevelop existing properties and these activities are subject to various risks we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition development or redevelopmentexpansion opportunities in addition newly acquired developed or redevelopedexpanded properties may not perform as well as expected we are subject to other risks in connection with any acquisition development and redevelopmentexpansion activities including the following 

• construction costs of a project may be higher than projected potentially making the project unfeasible or unprofitable • we may not be able to obtain financing or to refinance construction loans on favorable terms if at all • we may be unable to obtain zoning occupancy or other governmental approvals • occupancy rates and rents may not meet our projections and the project may not be profitable and • we may need the consent of third parties such as anchor tenants mortgage lenders and joint venture partners and those consents may be withheld if a development or redevelopmentexpansion project is unsuccessful either because it is not meeting our expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project planning we could lose our investment in the project further if we guarantee the propertys financing our loss could exceed our investment in the project 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid 

our properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets these investments are relatively illiquid as a result our ability to sell one or more of our properties or investments in real estate in response to any changes in economic or other conditions is limited if we want to sell a property we cannot assure you that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or that the sales price of a property will exceed the cost of our investment 

environmental risks 

as owners of real estate we can face liabilities for environmental contamination 

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require us as a current or previous owner or operator of real property to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at a property or at impacted neighboring properties these laws often impose liability regardless of whether the property owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances these laws and regulations may require the abatement or removal of asbestos containing materials in the event of damage demolition or renovation reconstruction or expansion of a property and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air those laws and regulations also govern the installation maintenance and removal of underground storage tanks used to store waste oils or other petroleum products many of our properties contain or at one time contained asbestos containing materials or underground storage tanks primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition but is not estimable the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may also adversely affect our ability to sell lease or redevelop a property or to borrow using a property as collateral 

our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful 

although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances this belief is based on limited testing nearly all of our properties have been subjected to phase i or similar environmental audits these environmental audits have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition however we cannot assure you that 

• existing environmental studies with respect to the portfolio reveal all potential environmental liabilities • any previous owner occupant or tenant of a property did not create any material environmental condition not known to us 9 

• the current environmental condition of the portfolio will not be affected by tenants and occupants by the condition of nearby properties or by other unrelated third parties or • future uses or conditions including without limitation changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof will not result in environmental liabilities retail operations risks 

we are subject to risks that affect the general retail environment 

our concentration in the retail real estate market means that we are subject to the risks that affect the retail environment generally including the levels of consumer spending seasonality the willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers tenant bankruptcies changes in economic conditions consumer confidence and terrorist activities the possibility that the united states may currently be experiencing a recession could adversely affect consumer spending any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we may not be able to lease newly developed properties and renew leases and relet space at existing properties 

we may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants or for rents that are consistent with our projections also when leases for our existing properties expire the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms to the extent that our leasing plans are not achieved our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures could be adversely affected 

some of our properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of or a store closure by one or more of these tenants 

regional malls are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally recognized tenants the value of some of our properties could be adversely affected if these tenants fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations department store and larger store also referred to as big box consolidations typically result in the closure of existing stores or duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations we do not control the disposition of those department stores or larger stores that we do not own we also may not control the vacant space that is not released in those stores we do own other tenants may be entitled to modify the terms of their existing leases in the event of such closures the modification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and could decrease rents or expense recovery charges additionally major tenant closures may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sales at other stores if the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to closing of anchors economic conditions or other reasons tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges in the event of default by a tenant or anchor store we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with those parties 

we face potential adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies 

bankruptcy filings by retailers occur frequently in the course of our operations we are continually releasing vacant spaces resulting from tenant terminations the bankruptcy of a tenant particularly an anchor tenant may make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the affected properties future tenant bankruptcies could adversely affect our properties or impact our ability to successfully execute our releasing strategy 

risks relating to joint venture properties 

we have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance them 

as of december 31 2007 we owned interests in 181 incomeproducing properties with other parties of those 19 properties are included in our consolidated financial statements we account for the other 162 properties under the equity method of accounting which we refer to as joint venture properties we serve as general partner or property manager for 93 of these 162 properties however certain major decisions such as selling or refinancing these properties require the consent of the other owners of the properties for which we do not serve as general partner or 

property manager 59 are in our international joint ventures the other owners also have other participating rights that we consider substantive for purposes of determining control over the properties assets the remaining joint venture properties are managed by third parties these limitations may adversely affect our ability to sell refinance or otherwise operate these properties 

the operating partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties 

joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property as of december 31 2007 the operating partnership has loan guarantees and other guarantee obligations to support 1325 million and 606 million respectively of our total 66 billion share of joint venture mortgage and other indebtedness a default by a joint venture under its debt obligations may expose us to liability under a guaranty or letter of credit 

other factors affecting our business 

our common area maintenance cam contributions may not allow us to recover the majority of our operating expenses from tenants 

cam costs typically include allocable energy costs repairs maintenance and capital improvements to common areas janitorial services administrative property and liability insurance costs and security costs we historically have used leases with variable cam provisions that adjust to reflect inflationary increases however we are making a concerted effort to shift from variable to fixed cam contributions for our cost recoveries which will fix our tenants cam contributions to us as a result our cam contributions may not allow us to recover a substantial portion of these operating costs 

we face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably 

our properties compete with other retail properties for tenants on the basis of the rent charged and location the principal competition may come from existing or future developments in the same market areas and from discount shopping centers outlet malls catalogues discount shopping clubs and electronic commerce the presence of competitive properties also affects our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain renovations and expansions at competing malls could also negatively affect our properties 

we also compete with other retail property developers to acquire prime development sites in addition we compete with other retail property companies for attractive tenants and qualified management 

our international expansion may subject us to different or greater risk from those associated with our domestic operations 

we hold interests in joint venture properties that are under operation in europe japan south korea and mexico we have also established arrangements to develop joint venture properties in china and expect to pursue additional expansion opportunities outside the united states international development and ownership activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our domestic properties and operations these risks include 

• adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies • changes in foreign political and economic environments regionally nationally and locally • challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws including corporate governance operations taxes and litigation • differing lending practices • differences in cultures • changes in applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect foreign operations • difficulties in managing international operations and • obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash although our international activities currently are a relatively small portion of our business international properties represented less than 6 of the gla of all of our properties at december 31 2007 to the extent that we expand our international activities these risks could increase in significance which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance 

we maintain commercial general liability all risk property coverage including fire flood extended coverage and rental loss insurance on our properties our captive insurance company subsidiaries indemnify our general liability carrier for a specific layer of losses a similar policy written through our subsidiary also provides a portion of our initial coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal windstorm locations even insured losses could result in a serious disruption to our business and delay our receipt of revenue 

there are some types of losses including lease and other contract claims that generally are not insured if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property if this happens we may still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 

we currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties on an all risk basis in the amount of up to 1 billion per occurrence for certified foreign acts of terrorism and 500 million per occurrence for noncertified domestic acts of terrorism the current federal laws which provide this coverage are expected to operate through 2014 despite the existence of this insurance coverage any threatened or actual terrorist attacks in high profile markets could adversely affect our property values revenues consumer traffic and tenant sales 

inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although inflation has not materially impacted our operations in the recent past increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on our mortgage and debt interest and general and administrative expenses as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents also inflation may adversely affect tenant leases with stated rent increases which could be lower than the increase in inflation at any given time inflation could also have an adverse effect on consumer spending which could impact our tenants sales and in turn our overage rents where applicable 

risks relating to federal income taxes 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have adverse tax consequences to us and our stockholders 

we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a reit qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes is governed by highly technical and complex provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations if we fail to comply with those provisions we may be subject to monetary penalties or ultimately to possible disqualification as a reit if such events occurs and if available relief provisions do not apply 

• we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income • we will be subject to corporate level income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and • unless entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions we will also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost as a result net income and funds available for distribution to our stockholders will be reduced for those years in which we fail to qualify as a reit also we would no longer be required to distribute money to our stockholders although we currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a reit future economic market legal tax or other considerations might cause us to revoke our reit election

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in november of 2004 the attorneys general of massachusetts new hampshire and connecticut filed complaints in their respective state courts against us and our affiliate spggc inc alleging that the sale of cobranded bankissued gift cards sold in certain of our properties violated gift certificate statutes and consumer protection laws in those states we filed our own actions for declaratory relief in federal district courts in each of the three states we have also been named as a defendant in two other state court proceedings in new york which have been brought by private parties as purported class actions they allege violation of state consumer protection and contract laws and seek a variety of remedies including unspecified damages and injunctive relief 

in 2006 we received a judgment in our favor in the federal district court in new hampshire the first circuit court of appeals affirmed that ruling on may 30 2007 holding that the current gift card program is a banking product and state law regulation is preempted by federal banking laws the first circuit court of appeals did not however rule on the question of whether the gift card program as it existed prior to january 1 2005 was similarly exempt from state regulation in february 2007 we entered into a voluntary nofault settlement with the new hampshire attorney general relating to the gift card program in new hampshire as it existed prior to january 1 2005 the new hampshire litigation was dismissed at that time 

in october 2007 the second circuit court of appeals issued a ruling in the case brought by the connecticut attorney general holding that the connecticut gift card statute could be applied to the gift card program as it existed prior to january 1 2005 and could prohibit the charging of administrative fees but could not prohibit the use of expiration dates on gift cards 

we believe we have viable defenses under both state and federal laws to the pending gift card actions in massachusetts connecticut and new york although it is not possible to provide any assurance of the ultimate outcome of any of these pending actions management does not believe they will have any material adverse affect on our financial position results of operations or cash flow 

we are involved in various other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business we believe that such litigation claims and administrative proceedings will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or our results of operations we record a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated
