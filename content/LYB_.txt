 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

overview 

lyondellbasell industries nv is a global independent chemical company and was incorporated as a naamloze vennootschap under dutch law on october 15 2009 unless otherwise indicated the “company” “we” “our” “us” and “lyondellbasell” are used in this report to refer to the businesses of lyondellbasell industries nv and its consolidated subsidiaries we are one of the world’s top independent chemical companies based on revenues 

we participate globally across the petrochemical value chain and are an industry leader in many of our product lines our chemicals businesses consist primarily of large processing plants that convert large volumes of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon feedstocks into plastic resins and other chemicals our chemical products tend to be basic building blocks for other chemicals and plastics our plastic products are used in large volumes as well as smaller specialty applications our customers use our plastics and chemicals to manufacture a wide range of products that people use in their everyday lives including food packaging home furnishings automotive components paints and coatings our refining business consists of our houston refinery which processes crude oil into refined products such as gasoline and distillates we also develop and license chemical and polyolefin process technologies and manufacture and sell polyolefin catalysts 

our financial performance is influenced by the supply and demand for our products the cost and availability of feedstocks and commodity products global and regional production capacity our operational efficiency and our ability to control costs we have a strong operational focus and as a producer of large volume commodities continuously strive to differentiate ourselves through safe reliable and lowcost operations in all our businesses we purchase large quantities of natural gas electricity and steam which we use as energy to fuel our facilities and purchase large quantities of natural gas liquids and crude oil derivatives which we use as feedstocks the relatively low cost of natural gasderived raw materials in the us versus the global cost of crude oilderived raw materials has had a significant positive influence on the profitability of our north american operations

financial information about our business segments and geographical areas can be found in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements information about the locations where we produce our primary products can be found under “description of properties” no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues in 2021 2020 or 2019 

olefins and polyolefins segments generally 

we are one of the leading worldwide producers of olefins and polyethylene “pe” and we are the world’s second largest producer of polypropylene “pp” we manage our olefin and polyolefin business in two reportable segments op — americas and op — eai 

olefins  coproducts —ethylene is the most significant petrochemical in terms of worldwide production volume and is the key building block for pe and many other chemicals and plastics ethylene is produced by steam cracking hydrocarbons such as ethane propane butane and naphtha this production results in coproducts such as aromatics and other olefins including propylene and butadiene ethylene and its coproducts are fundamental to many parts of the economy including the production of consumer products packaging housing and automotive components and other durable and nondurable goods olefins  coproducts sales accounted for approximately 11 of our consolidated revenues in 2021 and 9 of our consolidated revenues in each of 2020 and 2019 

polyolefins —polyolefins such as pe and pp are polymers derived from olefins including ethylene and propylene polyolefins are the most widely used thermoplastics in the world and are found in applications and products that enhance the everyday quality of life our products are used in consumer automotive and industrial applications ranging from food and beverage packaging to housewares and construction materials 

polyethylene —we produce high density polyethylene “hdpe” low density polyethylene “ldpe” and linear low density polyethylene “lldpe” pe sales accounted for approximately 22 21 and 17 of our consolidated revenues in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

polypropylene —we produce pp homopolymers and copolymers pp sales accounted for approximately 17 16 and 14 of our consolidated revenues in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

olefins and polyolefins—americas segment 

overview —our op—americas segment produces and markets olefins and coproducts polyethylene and polypropylene 

sales  marketing  customers —most of the ethylene we produce is consumed internally as a raw material in the production of pe and other derivatives with the balance sold to third party customers primarily under multiyear contracts 

we use all the propylene we produce in the production of pp propylene oxide and other derivatives of those products we also purchase propylene from third parties in addition to purchases of propylene we purchase ethylene for resale when necessary to satisfy customer demand above our own production levels volumes of any of these products purchased for resale can vary significantly from period to period and are typically most significant during extended outages of our own production such as during planned maintenance however purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profits except to the extent that they replace our lowercost production we also consume pp in our pp compounding business which is included in our aps segment 

most of the ethylene and propylene production from our channelview corpus christi and la porte texas facilities is shipped via a pipeline system which has connections to numerous us gulf coast consumers this pipeline system extends from corpus christi to mont belvieu texas in addition exchange agreements with other ethylene and coproducts producers allow access to customers who are not directly connected to this pipeline system some ethylene is shipped by railcar from our clinton iowa facility to our morris illinois facility and some is shipped directly to customers propylene from clinton and morris is generally shipped by marine vessel barge railcar or truck 

our pp and pe production is typically sold through our sales organization to an extensive base of established customers and distributors servicing both the domestic and export markets either under annual contracts or on a spot basis we have sales offices in various locations in north america and our polyolefins are primarily transported in north america by railcar or truck export sales are primarily to customers in latin america with sales to asia expected to increase in the coming years as global supply and demand balances shift 

joint venture relationships —in december 2020 we purchased a 50 interest in louisiana integrated polyethylene jv llc “louisiana joint venture” which provides us with capacity of approximately 770 thousand tons of ethylene and 445 thousand tons of low density and linearlow density pe production per year we operate the joint venture assets and market the polyethylene offtake for all partners through our global sales team we also participate in a joint venture in mexico which provides us with capacity of approximately 290 thousand tons of pp production per year we do not hold a majority interest in or have operational control of this joint venture 

the capacities are based on our percentage ownership of the joint venture’s total capacity 

raw materials —raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost to produce ethylene and its coproducts the primary raw materials used in our americas olefin facilities are natural gas liquids “ngls” and heavy liquids heavy liquids include crude oilbased naphtha and other refined products as well as condensate a very light crude oil resulting from natural gas production ngls include ethane propane and butane the use of heavy liquid raw materials results in the production of significant volumes of coproducts such as propylene butadiene and benzene as well as gasoline blending components while the use of ngls results in the production of a smaller volume of coproducts 

our ability to pass on raw material price increases to our customers is dependent on marketdriven demand for olefins and polyolefins sales prices for products sold in the spot market are determined by market forces our contract prices are influenced by product supply and demand conditions spot prices indices published in industry publications and in some instances cost recovery formulas 

we can manufacture olefins by utilizing a variety of feedstocks including heavy liquids and ngls technological advances for extracting shalebased oil and gas have led to an increased supply of ngls providing a cost advantage over heavy liquids particularly in the us a plant’s flexibility to consume a wide range of raw materials generally provides an advantage over plants that are restricted in their processing capabilities our americas facilities can process significant quantities of either heavy liquids or ngls we estimate that in the us we can produce up to approximately 90 of our total ethylene output using ngls changes in the raw material feedstock mix utilized in the production process will result in variances in production capacities among products we believe our raw material flexibility in the us is a key advantage in our production of ethylene and its coproducts 

industry dynamics  competition —with respect to olefins and polyolefins competition is based on price and to a lesser extent on product quality product delivery reliability of supply product performance and customer service profitability is affected not only by supply and demand for olefins and polyolefins but also by raw material costs and price competition among producers which may intensify due to among other things the addition of new capacity in general demand is a function of economic growth including the regional dynamics that underlie global growth trends 

we compete in north america with other large marketers and producers including global chemical companies chemical divisions of large oil companies and regional marketers and producers 

based on published capacity data and including our proportionate share of joint ventures we believe as of december 31 2021 we were 

• the second largest producer of ethylene in north america with ethylene capacity of 62 million tons per year including our share of our louisiana joint venture capacity 

• the third largest producer of pe in north america with capacity of 41 million tons per year including our share of our louisiana joint venture capacity and 

• the second largest producer of pp in north america with capacity of 19 million tons per year including our share of our mexican joint venture capacity and approximately 280 thousand tons of catalloy capacity reported within our advanced polymer solutions segment 

olefins and polyolefins—europe asia international segment 

overview —our op — eai segment produces and markets olefins and coproducts polyethylene and polypropylene 

sales  marketing  customers —our ethylene production is primarily consumed internally as a raw material in the production of polyolefins and we purchase additional ethylene as needed to meet our production needs our propylene production is used as a raw material in the production of pp and propylene oxide and derivatives of those products and we regularly purchase propylene from third parties because our internal needs exceed our internal production 

with respect to pp and pe our production is typically sold through our sales organization to an extensive base of established customers under annual contracts or on a spot basis and is also sold through distributors our polyolefins are primarily transported in europe by railcar or truck 

our regional sales offices are in various locations including the netherlands hong kong china india australia and the united arab emirates we also operate through a worldwide network of local sales and representative offices in europe and asia our joint ventures described below typically manage their domestic sales and marketing efforts independently and we typically operate as their agent for all or a portion of their exports 

joint venture relationships —we participate in several manufacturing joint ventures in saudi arabia china poland south korea thailand and the netherlands we do not hold majority interests in any of these joint ventures nor do we have operational control these joint ventures provide us with additional annual production capacity of approximately 16 million tons of pp approximately 12 million tons of olefins and approximately 820 thousand tons of pe these capacities are based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint ventures’ total capacities 

our 50 joint venture in quality circular polymers “qcp” located in the netherlands uses mechanical recycling to transform postconsumer plastic waste into highquality polymers that can be used to make new products the qcp plants located in the netherlands and belgium are capable of converting consumer waste into 55 thousand tons of recycled polypropylene and recycled highdensity polyethylene annually 

we generally license our polyolefin process technologies and supply catalysts to our joint ventures through our technology segment some of our joint ventures are able to source cost advantaged raw materials from their local shareholders 

raw materials —raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost for the production of olefins and coproducts the primary raw material used in our european olefin facilities is naphtha however we also have the capability to displace up to half of our european assets naphtha needs with other feedstocks such as liquified petroleum gases we have flexibility to vary the raw material mix and process conditions in our plants in order to maximize profitability as market prices for both feedstocks and products change 

the principal raw materials used in the production of polyolefins are propylene and ethylene in europe we have the capacity to produce approximately 50 of the propylene requirements for our european pp production and all of the ethylene requirements for our european pe production propylene and ethylene requirements that are not produced internally are generally acquired pursuant to longterm contracts with third party suppliers or via spot purchases 

our ability to pass through the increased cost of raw materials to customers is dependent on global market demand for olefins and polyolefins in general the pricing for purchases and sales of most products is determined by global market forces including the impacts of foreign exchange rates relative to the pricing of the underlying raw materials most of which are priced in us dollars there can be a lag between raw material price changes and contract product price changes that will cause volatility in our product margins 

industry dynamics  competition —with respect to olefins and polyolefins competition is based on price product quality product delivery reliability of supply product performance and customer service we compete with regional and multinational chemical companies and divisions of large oil companies the petrochemical market has been affected by the price volatility of naphtha the primary feedstock for olefins in the region 

based on published capacity data and including our proportionate share of our joint ventures we believe as of december 31 2021 we were 

• the fifth largest producer of ethylene in europe with an ethylene capacity of 19 million tons per year 

• the largest producer of pe in europe with 22 million tons per year of capacity including our share of our joint ventures in poland and the netherlands and 

• the largest producer of pp in europe with 27 million tons per year of capacity including our share of our joint ventures in poland and the netherlands and approximately 280 thousand tons of catalloy capacity reported within our advanced polymer solutions segment 

intermediates and derivatives segment 

overview —our id segment produces and markets propylene oxide “po” and its derivatives oxyfuels and related products and intermediate chemicals such as styrene monomer “sm” acetyls and ethylene oxides and derivatives 

po and derivatives— we produce po through two distinct technologies one of which yields tertiary butyl alcohol “tba” as the coproduct and the other of which yields sm as the coproduct the two technologies are mutually exclusive with dedicated assets for manufacturing either potba or posm po is an intermediate commodity chemical and is a precursor of polyols propylene glycol propylene glycol ethers and butanediol po and derivatives are used in a variety of durable and consumable items with key applications such as polyurethanes used for insulation automotivefurniture cushioning coatings surfactants synthetic resins and several other household usages we are currently constructing a worldscale potba plant in houston texas once completed the plant will have the capacity to produce 470 thousand tons of po and 10 million tons of tertiary butyl alcohol per year the project is expected to startup at the end of 2022 and expected to result in total capital expenditures of approximately 34 billion 

oxyfuels and related products —we produce two distinct etherbased oxyfuels methyl tertiary butyl ether “mtbe” and ethyl tertiary butyl ether “etbe” these oxyfuels are produced by converting the tba coproduct of po into isobutylene and reacting with methanol or ethanol to produce either mtbe or etbe both are used as highoctane gasoline components that help gasoline burn cleaner and reduce automobile emissions other tba derivatives which we refer to as “c4 chemicals” are largely used to make synthetic rubber and other gasoline additives 

intermediate chemicals —we produce other commodity chemicals that utilize ethylene as a key component feedstock including sm acetyls and ethylene oxide derivatives sm is utilized in various applications such as plastics expandable polystyrene for packaging foam cups and containers insulation products and durables and engineering resins our acetyls products comprise methanol glacial acetic acid “gaa” and vinyl acetate monomer “vam” natural gas methane is the feedstock for methanol some of which is converted to gaa and a portion of the gaa is reacted with ethylene to create vam vam is an intermediate chemical used in fabric or wood treatments pigments coatings films and adhesives ethylene oxide is an intermediate chemical that is used to produce ethylene glycol glycol ethers and other derivatives ethylene oxide and its derivatives are used in the production of polyester antifreeze fluids solvents and other chemical products 

sales  marketing  customers —we sell our po and derivatives through multiyear sales and processing agreements as well as spot sales some of our contract sales agreements have cost plus pricing terms po and derivatives are transported by barge marine vessel pipeline railcar and tank truck 

we sell our oxyfuels and related products under market and costbased sales agreements and in the spot market oxyfuels are transported by barge marine vessel and tank truck and are used as octane blending components worldwide outside of the us due to their blending characteristics and emission benefits c4 chemicals such as highpurity isobutylene are sold to producers of synthetic rubber and other chemical products primarily in the us and europe and are transported by railcar tank truck pipeline and marine shipments 

intermediate chemicals are shipped by barge marine vessel pipeline railcar and tank truck sm is sold globally into regions such as north america europe asia and south america export markets through spot sales and commercial contracts within acetyls methanol is consumed internally to make gaa used as a feedstock for oxyfuels and related products and also sold directly into the merchant commercial market gaa is converted with ethylene to produce vam which is sold worldwide under multiyear commercial contracts and on a spot basis 

sales of our po and derivatives oxyfuels and related products and intermediate chemicals are made by our marketing and sales personnel and also through distributors and independent agents in the americas europe the middle east africa and the asiapacific region 

joint venture relationships —we have two po joint ventures with covestro ag one in the us and one in europe we operate all production facilities for the po joint ventures covestro’s interest in the us po joint ventures represents ownership of an inkind portion of the po production of 680 thousand tons per year we take inkind the remaining po production and all coproduct production covestro also has the right to 50 of the po and sm production of our european po joint venture our proportional production capacity provided through this venture is approximately 160 thousand tons of po and approximately 340 thousand tons of sm we do not share marketing or product sales with covestro under either of these po joint ventures 

we also have two joint venture manufacturing relationships in china with china petroleum  chemical corporation “sinopec” the first joint venture provides us with additional production capacity of approximately 50 thousand tons of po per year the second joint venture which began production in january 2022 will provide us with additional annual production capacity of approximately 140 thousand tons of po and 300 thousand tons of sm these capacities are based on our operational share of the joint ventures’ total capacities we market our share of the joint ventures production in the chinese market 

raw materials —the cost of raw materials is the largest component of total production cost for po its coproducts and its derivatives propylene isobutane or mixed butane ethylene and benzene are the primary raw materials used in the production of po and its coproducts the market prices of these raw materials historically have been related to the price of crude oil ngls and natural gas as well as supply and demand for the raw materials 

in the us we obtain a large portion of our propylene benzene and ethylene raw materials needed for the production of po and its coproducts from our op — americas segment and to a lesser extent from third parties raw materials for the nonus production of po and its coproducts are obtained from our op — eai segment and from third parties we consume a significant portion of our internallyproduced po in the production of po derivatives 

the raw material requirements not sourced internally are purchased at marketbased prices from numerous suppliers in the us and europe with which we have established contractual relationships as well as in the spot market 

for the production of oxyfuels we purchase our ethanol feedstock requirements from third parties and obtain our methanol from both internal production and external sources carbon monoxide and methanol are the primary raw materials required for the production of gaa we source carbon monoxide from internal production which can be complemented by purchases from external sources as needed the methanol required for our downstream production of acetyls is internally sourced from our methanol plants in la porte texas and channelview texas natural gas is the primary raw material required for the production of methanol 

in addition to ethylene acetic acid is a primary raw material for the production of vam we obtain all our requirements for acetic acid and ethylene from our internal production historically we have used a large percentage of our acetic acid production to produce vam 

industry dynamics  competition —with respect to product competition the market is influenced and based on a variety of factors including product quality price reliability of supply technical support customer service and potential substitute materials profitability is affected by the worldwide level of demand along with price competition which may intensify due to among other things new industry capacity and industry outages demand growth could be impacted by further development of alternative biobased methodologies our major worldwide competitors include other multinational chemical and refining companies as well as some regional marketers and producers 

based on published capacity data and including our proportionate share of our joint ventures we believe as of december 31 2021 we were 

• the second largest producer of po worldwide and 

• the second largest producer of oxyfuels worldwide 

advanced polymer solutions segment 

overview —our aps segment produces and markets compounding and solutions such as polypropylene compounds engineered plastics masterbatches colors and powders engineered composites and advanced polymers which include catalloy and polybutene1 polyolefin resins 

compounding and solutions —our polypropylene compounds are produced from blends of polyolefins and additives and are largely focused on automotive applications engineered plastics and engineered composites add value for more specialized highperformance applications used across a variety of industries masterbatches are compounds that provide differentiated properties when combined with commodity plastics used in packaging agriculture and durable goods applications specialty powders are largely used to mold toys industrial tanks and sporting goods such as kayaks performance colors provide powdered pelletized and liquid color concentrates for the plastics industry 

advanced polymers — catalloy and polybutene1 are unique polymers that can be used within the segment for downstream compounding or can be sold as raw materials to third parties catalloy is a line of differentiated propylenebased polymers that add value in packaging applications and construction materials such as the white membranes used in the commercial roofing market polybutene1 is used in both specialty piping and packaging applications 

sales  marketing  customers —our products are sold through our global sales organization to a broad base of established customers and distributors under contract or on a spot basis these products are transported to our customers primarily by either truck or bulk rail the sales of compounding and solutions products accounted for approximately 9 of our consolidated revenues in 2021 and 12 of consolidated revenues in each of 2020 and 2019 

joint venture relationships —we participate in several manufacturing joint ventures in saudi arabia indonesia and thailand we hold majority interests and have operational control of the joint ventures in indonesia we do not hold majority interests in any of the remaining joint ventures nor do we have operational control these ventures provide us with additional production capacity of approximately 75 thousand tons of compounding and solutions these capacities are based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint ventures’ total capacities 

raw materials —the principal materials used in the production of our compounding and solutions products are polypropylene polyethylene polystyrene nylon and titanium dioxide raw materials required for the production of our compounding and solutions products are obtained from our wholly owned or joint venture facilities and from a number of major plastic resin producers or other suppliers at marketbased prices 

the principal raw materials used in the production of advanced polymers are ethylene propylene and butene1 ethylene and propylene requirements that are not produced internally and externallysupplied butene1 are acquired through longterm contracts with third party suppliers or via spot purchases 

our ability to pass through the increased cost of raw materials to customers is dependent on global market demand in general the pricing for purchases and sales of most products is determined by global market forces 

industry dynamics  competition —with respect to product competition the market is influenced and based on a variety of factors including price product quality product delivery reliability of supply product performance and customer service we compete with regional and multinational marketers and producers of plastic resins and compounds 

based on published capacity data and including our proportionate share of our joint ventures we believe as of december 31 2021 we were the largest global producer of polypropylene compounds 

refining segment 

overview —the primary products of our refining segment are refined products made from heavy highsulfur crude oil and other crude oils of varied types and sources available on the us gulf coast these refined products include gasoline and distillates 

sales  marketing  customers —the houston refinery’s products are primarily sold in bulk to other refiners marketers distributors and wholesalers at marketrelated prices most of the houston refinery’s products are sold under contracts with a term of one year or less or are sold in the spot market the houston refinery’s products generally are transported to customers via pipelines and terminals owned and operated by other parties the sales of refined products accounted for approximately 16 of our consolidated revenues in each of 2021 and 2020 and 22 of consolidated revenues in 2019 

raw materials —our houston refinery which is located on the houston ship channel in houston texas has a heavy highsulfur crude oil processing capacity of approximately 268 thousand barrels per day on a calendar day basis normal operating basis or approximately 292 thousand barrels per day on a stream day basis maximum achievable over a 24hour period the houston refinery is a full conversion refinery designed to refine heavy highsulfur crude oil this crude oil is more viscous and denser than traditional crude oil and contains higher concentrations of sulfur and heavy metals making it more difficult to refine into gasoline and other highvalue fuel products while heavy highsulfur crude oil has historically been less costly to purchase than light lowsulfur crude oil in recent years the price difference has narrowed us production is predominantly light sweet crude and much of the heavy crude has generally been imported from canada mexico and other global producers which has at times been subject to supply disruptions 

we purchase the crude oil used as a raw material for the houston refinery on the open market on a spot basis and under a number of supply agreements with regional producers generally with terms varying from one to two years 

industry dynamics  competition —our refining competitors are major integrated oil companies refineries owned or controlled by foreign governments and independent domestic refiners based on published data as of january 2021 there were 129 operable crude oil refineries in the us and total us refinery capacity was approximately 18 million barrels per day during 2021 the houston refinery processed an average of approximately 231 thousand barrels per day of heavy crude oil 

our refining operations compete for the purchases of crude oil based on price and quality supply disruptions could impact the availability and pricing we compete in gasoline and distillate markets as a bulk supplier of fungible products satisfying industry and government specifications competition is based on price and location 

the markets for fuel products tend to be volatile as well as cyclical due to supply and demand fundamentals and changing crude oil and refined product prices crude oil prices are impacted by worldwide political events the economics of exploration and production and refined products demand prices and demand for fuel products are influenced by seasonal and shortterm factors such as weather and driving patterns as well as by longer term issues such as the economy environmental concerns energy conservation and alternative fuels industry fuel products supply is dependent on shortterm industry operating capabilities and on longterm refining capacity 

a crack spread is a benchmark indication of refining margins based on the processing of a specific type of crude oil into an assumed selection of major refined products the houston refinery generally tracks the maya 211 crack spread which represents the difference between the current month us gulf coast price of two barrels of maya crude oil as set by petróleos mexicanos and one barrel each of us gulf coast reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending gasoline and of us gulf coast ultra low sulfur diesel while these benchmark refining spreads are generally indicative of the level of profitability at the houston refinery and similarly configured refineries there are many other factors specific to each refinery and the industry in general such as the value of refinery byproducts which influence operating results refinery byproducts are products other than gasoline and distillates that represent about onethird of the total product volume and include coke sulfur and lighter materials such as ngls and crude olefins streams the cost of renewable identification numbers “rins” which are renewable fuel credits mandated by the us environmental protection agency the “epa” can also affect profitability 

technology segment 

overview —our technology segment develops and licenses chemical and polyolefin process technologies and manufactures and sells polyolefin catalysts we market our process technologies and our polyolefin catalysts to external customers and also use them in our own manufacturing operations over the past three years approximately 20 to 25 of our catalyst sales were sold internally to other segments 

our polyolefin process licenses are structured to provide a standard core technology with individual customer needs met by adding customized modules that provide the required capabilities to produce the defined production grade slate and plant capacity in addition to the basic license agreement a range of services can also be provided including project assistance training assistance in starting up the plant and ongoing technical support after startup we may also offer marketing and sales services in addition licensees may continue to purchase polyolefin catalysts that are consumed in the production process generally under longterm catalyst supply agreements with us

in 2021 2020 and 2019 our rd expenditures were 124 million 113 million and 111 million respectively a portion of these expenses are related to technical support and customer service and are allocated to the other business segments in 2021 2020 and 2019 approximately 45 45 and 50 respectively of all rd costs were allocated to business segments other than technology 

general 

intellectual property 

we maintain an extensive patent portfolio and continue to file new patent applications in the us and other countries as of december 31 2021 we owned approximately 6000 patents and patent applications worldwide our patents and trade secrets cover our processes products and catalysts and are significant to our competitive position particularly with regard to po intermediate chemicals petrochemicals polymers and our process technologies while we believe that our intellectual property provides competitive advantages we do not regard our businesses as being materially dependent upon any single patent trade secret or trademark some of our production capacity operates under licenses from third parties 

environmental 

most of our operations are affected by national state regional and local environmental laws matters pertaining to the environment are discussed in part i item 1a risk factors  part i item 3 legal proceedings  part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation s and notes 2 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

we have made and intend to continue to make the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to environmental health and safety matters we incurred capital expenditures of 198 million in 2021 for health safety and environmental compliance purposes and improvement programs and estimate such expenditures to be approximately 285 million in 2022 and 390 million in 2023 

while capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance including compliance with potential legislation and potential regulation related to climate change cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe they will have a material effect on our competitive position in the near term 

while there can be no assurance that physical impacts to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future we do not believe these impacts are material in the near term 

sustainability 

lyondellbasell is taking action to help tackle the global challenges of eliminating plastic waste addressing climate change and supporting a thriving society our sustainability strategy identifies five pillars that frame our response to these challenges end plastic waste in the environment advance the circular economy address climate change grow sustainable solutions and enhance our workplace operations and communities 

in 2020 we announced our ambition to produce and market two million metric tons of recycled and renewablebased polymers annually by 2030 we are pursuing this goal by focusing on mechanical recycling advanced or molecular recycling and increased use of renewable feedstocks in furtherance of this goal in april 2021 the company launched a new suite of products under the name circulen  primarily enabling brand owners to improve the sustainability of consumer products the lyondellbasell circulen product family supports the reduction of plastic waste through the use of recycled content and a lower carbon footprint through the use of renewablebased content as compared to feedstock from fossilbased sources and includes circulen recover polymers made from plastic waste through a mechanical recycling process circulen revive polymers made using an advanced or molecular recycling process to convert plastic waste into feedstock to produce new polymers and circulen renew polymers made from renewablebased feedstock derived from biobased wastes and residual oils such as used cooking oils 

in september 2021 we announced our ambition of and approach to achieving net zero scope 1 and 2 emissions from global operations by 2050 as an interim step toward 2050 we also announced a strategy to achieve an absolute reduction of 30 percent in scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 2030 these targets are consistent with efforts to support the paris agreement’s goal of limiting climate change by achieving net zero for global greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury our approach to achieve our 2030 goals include reducing flare emissions optimizing the use of energy in our operations increasing our use of lower carbon intensive fuels and a minimum of 50 percent of electricity procured from renewable sources our ambition to achieve net zero by 2050 will also need to be enabled by the development and deployment of new technology including those related to cracker electrification the use of hydrogen carbon capture and storage and carbon utilization across the company’s manufacturing footprint 

to achieve our targets we expect capital spending in the future will include investments to support lowering emissions in our operations we also anticipate incurring costs for environmental compliance including compliance with potential legislation and potential regulation related to climate change these projects are currently at various stages of evaluation or progress we do not expect capital spending to support these ambitions over the next two years will represent a significant amount of total capital expenditures

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 

risks related to our business and industry 

the cyclicality and volatility of the industries in which we participate may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 

our business operations are subject to the cyclical and volatile nature of the supplydemand balance in the chemical and refining industries our future operating results are expected to continue to be affected by this cyclicality and volatility the chemical and refining industries historically have experienced alternating periods of capacity shortages causing prices and profit margins to increase followed by periods of excess capacity resulting in oversupply declining capacity utilization rates and declining prices and profit margins 

in addition to changes in the supply and demand for products changes in energy prices and other worldwide economic conditions can cause volatility these factors result in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over business cycles 

new capacity additions around the world may lead to periods of oversupply and lower profitability the timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions are uncertain and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time as a consequence we are unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of future industry cycles or their effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

a sustained decrease in the price of crude oil may adversely impact the results of our operations primarily in north america 

energy costs generally follow price trends of crude oil and natural gas these price trends may be highly volatile and cyclical in the past raw material and energy costs have experienced significant fluctuations that adversely affected our business segments’ results of operations for example we have benefited from the favorable ratio of us crude oil prices to natural gas prices in the past if the price of crude oil remains lower relative to us natural gas prices or if the demand for natural gas and ngls increases this may have a negative impact on our results of operations 

costs and limitations on supply of raw materials and energy may result in increased operating expenses 

the costs of raw materials and energy represent a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to the significant competition we face and the commodity nature of many of our products we are not always able to pass on raw material and energy cost increases to our customers when we do have the ability to pass on the cost increases we are not always able to do so quickly enough to avoid adverse impacts on our results of operations 

cost increases for raw materials energy or broadbased price inflation also may increase working capital needs which could reduce our liquidity and cash flow even if we are able to increase our sales prices to reflect these increases demand for products may decrease as consumers and customers reduce their consumption or use substitute products which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition producers in natural gas costadvantaged regions such as the middle east and north america benefit from the lower prices of natural gas and ngls competition from producers in these regions may cause us to reduce exports from europe and elsewhere any such reductions may increase competition for product sales within europe and other markets which can result in lower margins in those regions 

for some of our raw materials and utilities there are a limited number of suppliers and in some cases the supplies are specific to the particular geographic region in which a facility is located it is also common in the chemical and refining industries for a facility to have a sole dedicated source for its utilities such as steam electricity and gas having a sole or limited number of suppliers may limit our negotiating power particularly in the case of rising raw material costs any new supply agreements we enter into may not have terms as favorable as those contained in our current supply agreements 

additionally there is growing concern over the reliability of water sources including around the us gulf coast where several of our facilities are located the decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of population growth drought or regulation could negatively impact our operations including by impacting our ability to produce or transport our products 

if our raw material or utility supplies were disrupted our businesses may incur increased costs to procure alternative supplies or incur excessive downtime which would have a negative impact on plant operations disruptions of supplies may occur as a result of transportation issues resulting from natural disasters water levels and interruptions in marine water routes among other causes that can affect the operations of vessels barges rails trucks and pipeline traffic these risks are particularly prevalent in the us gulf coast area additionally increasing exports of ngls and crude oil from the us or greater restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could restrict the availability of our raw materials thereby increasing our costs 

with increased volatility in raw material costs our suppliers could impose more onerous terms on us resulting in shorter payment cycles and increasing our working capital requirements 

our ability to source raw materials may be adversely affected by political instability civil disturbances or other governmental actions 

we obtain a portion of our principal raw materials from sources in the middle east and central and south america that may be less politically stable than other areas in which we conduct business political instability civil disturbances and actions by governments in these areas are more likely to substantially increase the price and decrease the supply of raw materials necessary for our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

incidents of civil unrest including terrorist attacks and demonstrations that have been marked by violence have occurred in a number of countries in the middle east and south america some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest political instability and civil unrest could continue to spread in the region and involve other areas such unrest if it continues to spread or grow in intensity could lead to civil wars regional conflicts or regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to countries in which we conduct substantial business such as in the us europe or their respective trading partners 

our business is capital intensive and we rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and ongoing capital needs limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results 

we require significant capital to operate our current business and fund our growth strategy moreover interest payments dividends capital requirements of our joint ventures the expansion of our current business or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital if we need external financing our access to credit markets and pricing of our capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies and the state of the capital markets generally there can be no assurances that we would be able to incur indebtedness on terms we deem acceptable and it is possible that the cost of any financings could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities which could adversely affect our operating results 

we may use our 3250 million revolving credit facility which backs our commercial paper program to meet our cash needs to the extent available as of december 31 2021 we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the facility and 204 million net of discount outstanding under our commercial paper program leaving an unused and available credit capacity of 3046 million we may also meet our cash needs by selling receivables under our 900 million us receivables facility as of december 31 2021 we had availability of 900 million under this facility in the event of a default under our credit facilities or any of our senior notes we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do any default under any of our credit arrangements could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate 

risks related to our operations 

our operations are subject to risks inherent in chemical and refining businesses and we could be subject to liabilities for which we are not fully insured or that are not otherwise mitigated 

we maintain property business interruption product general liability casualty and other types of insurance that we believe are appropriate for our business and operations as well as in line with industry practices however we are not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to our business including losses resulting from natural disasters or climaterelated exposures wars or terrorist acts changes in insurance market conditions have caused and may in the future cause premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies to increase substantially and in some instances for certain insurance to become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured we might not be able to finance the amount of the uninsured liability on terms acceptable to us or at all and might be obligated to divert a significant portion of our cash flow from normal business operations 

our business including our results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected by safety or product liability issues 

failure to appropriately manage safety human health product liability and environmental risks associated with our products product life cycles and production processes could adversely impact employees communities stakeholders our reputation and our results of operations public perception of the risks associated with our products and production processes could impact product acceptance and influence the regulatory environment in which we operate while we have procedures and controls to manage safety risks issues could be created by events outside of our control including natural disasters severe weather events and acts of sabotage 

further because a part of our business involves licensing polyolefin process technology our licensees are exposed to similar risks involved in the manufacture and marketing of polyolefins hazardous incidents involving our licensees if they do result or are perceived to result from use of our technologies may harm our reputation threaten our relationships with other licensees andor lead to customer attrition and financial losses our policy of covering these risks through contractual limitations of liability and indemnities and through insurance may not always be effective as a result our financial condition and results of operation would be adversely affected and other companies with competing technologies may have the opportunity to secure a competitive advantage 

interruptions of operations at our facilities may result in increased liabilities or lower operating results 

we own and operate largescale facilities our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our various production facilities and the ability to complete construction and maintenance projects on schedule interruptions at our facilities may materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or our business as a whole during and after the period of such operational difficulties in recent years we have had to shut down plants on the us gulf coast including the temporary shutdown of a portion of our houston refinery as a result of various hurricanes striking texas and louisiana in addition because the houston refinery is our only refining operation an outage at the refinery could have a particularly negative impact on our operating results as we do not have the ability to increase refining production elsewhere 

although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions our operations are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and refining and the related storage and transportation of raw materials products and wastes these potential hazards include 

• pipeline leaks and ruptures 

• explosions 

• fires 

• severe weather and natural disasters 

• mechanical failure 

• unscheduled downtimes 

• supplier disruptions 

• labor shortages or other labor difficulties 

• transportation interruptions 

• remediation complications 

• increased restrictions on or the unavailability of water for use at our manufacturing sites or for the transport of our products or raw materials 

• chemical and oil spills 

• discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases 

• shipment of incorrect or offspecification product to customers 

• storage tank leaks 

• other environmental risks and 

• cyber attack or other terrorist acts 

some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or personal injury and loss of life and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date negatively impacting project returns if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering procurement and construction of facilities could materially adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results for example higher costs arising from the delayed construction of our worldscale potba plant in houston due to covid19 more extensive civil construction and unexpected tariffs on materials are expected to add approximately 40 to 50 to our original cost estimate for the project impacting our projected rate of return on the project delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to contract with our customers and supply certain products we produce such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors many of which are beyond our control including 

• denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals andor permits 

• unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor 

• disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials 

• adverse weather conditions natural disasters or other events such as equipment malfunctions explosions fires or spills affecting our facilities or those of vendors or suppliers 

• shortages of sufficiently skilled labor or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages and 

• nonperformance by or disputes with vendors suppliers contractors or subcontractors 

any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects if we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs or if market conditions change it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

shared control or lack of control of joint ventures may delay decisions or actions regarding our joint ventures 

a portion of our operations are conducted through joint ventures where control may be exercised by or shared with unaffiliated third parties we cannot control the actions or ownership of our joint venture partners including any nonperformance default or bankruptcy of joint venture partners the joint ventures that we do not control may also lack financial reporting systems to provide adequate and timely information for our reporting purposes 

our joint venture partners may have different interests or goals than we do and may take actions contrary to our requests policies or objectives differences in views among the joint venture participants also may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major matters potentially adversely affecting the business and operations of the joint ventures and in turn our business and operations we may develop a dispute with any of our partners over decisions affecting the venture that may result in litigation arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution if a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interest it could harm our brand business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be required to record material charges against our earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets 

we may be required to reduce production or idle facilities for extended periods of time or exit certain businesses as a result of the cyclical nature of our industry specifically oversupplies of or lack of demand for particular products or high raw material prices may cause us to reduce production we may choose to reduce production at certain facilities because we have offtake arrangements at other facilities which make any reductions or idling unavailable at those facilities any decision to permanently close facilities or exit a business would likely result in impairment and other charges to earnings for example in the fourth quarter of 2021 our refining segment recognized a noncash impairment charge of 624 million related to our houston refinery driven by our ongoing evaluation of strategic options for the houston refinery 

temporary outages at our facilities can last for several quarters and sometimes longer these outages could cause us to incur significant costs including the expenses of maintaining and restarting these facilities in addition we have significant obligations under takeorpay agreements even though we may reduce production at facilities we may be required to continue to purchase or pay for utilities or raw materials under these arrangements 

integration of acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions in order to enhance our business acquisitions involve numerous risks including meeting our standards for compliance problems combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs and liabilities diversion of management’s attention from our core businesses and potential loss of key employees 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to integrate successfully any businesses products technologies or personnel that we might acquire the integration of businesses that we may acquire is likely to be a complex timeconsuming and expensive process and we may not realize the anticipated revenues synergies or other benefits associated with our acquisitions if we do not manage and operate the acquired business up to our expectations if we are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems operating procedures financial controls and human resources practices our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

risks related to the global economy and multinational operations 

economic disruptions and downturns in general and particularly continued global economic uncertainty or economic turmoil in emerging markets could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

our results of operations can be materially affected by adverse conditions in the financial markets and depressed economic conditions generally economic downturns in the businesses and geographic areas in which we sell our products could substantially reduce demand for our products and result in decreased sales volumes and increased credit risk recessionary environments adversely affect our business because demand for our products is reduced particularly from our customers in industrial markets generally and the automotive and housing industries specifically and may result in higher costs of capital a significant portion of our revenues and earnings are derived from our business in europe in addition most of our european transactions and assets including cash reserves and receivables are denominated in euros 

we also derive significant revenues from our business in emerging markets particularly the emerging markets in asia and south america any broadbased downturn in these emerging markets or in a key market such as china could require us to reduce export volumes into these markets and could also require us to divert product sales to less profitable markets any of these conditions could ultimately harm our overall business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we sell products in highly competitive global markets and face significant price pressures 

we sell our products in highly competitive global markets due to the commodity nature of many of our products competition in these markets is based primarily on price and to a lesser extent on product performance product quality product deliverability reliability of supply and customer service often we are not able to protect our market position for these products by product differentiation and may not be able to pass on cost increases to our customers due to the significant competition in our business 

in addition we face increased competition from companies that may have greater financial resources and different cost structures or strategic goals than us these include large integrated oil companies some of which also have chemical businesses governmentowned businesses and companies that receive subsidies or other government incentives to produce certain products in a specified geographic region continuing competition from these companies especially in our olefin and refining businesses could limit our ability to increase product sales prices in response to raw material and other cost increases or could cause us to reduce product sales prices to compete effectively which would reduce our profitability competitors with different cost structures or strategic goals than we have may be able to invest significant capital into their businesses including expenditures for research and development in addition specialty products we produce may become commoditized over time increased competition could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 

we operate internationally and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations exchange controls political risks and other risks relating to international operations 

we operate internationally and are subject to the risks of doing business on a global level these risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates economic instability and disruptions restrictions on the transfer of funds and the imposition of trade restrictions or duties and tariffs and complex regulations concerning privacy and data security additional risks from our multinational business include transportation delays and interruptions war terrorist activities epidemics pandemics political instability import and export controls sanctions changes in governmental policies labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments 

we generate revenues from export sales and operations that may be denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency exchange rates between these currencies and functional currencies in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future it is possible that fluctuations in exchange rates will result in reduced operating results additionally we operate with the objective of having our worldwide cash available in the locations where it is needed including the united kingdom for our parent company’s significant cash obligations as a result of dividend payments it is possible that we may not always be able to provide cash to other jurisdictions when needed or that such transfers of cash could be subject to additional taxes including withholding taxes 

our operating results could be negatively affected by the laws rules and regulations as well as political environments in the jurisdictions in which we operate there could be reduced demand for our products decreases in the prices at which we can sell our products and disruptions of production or other operations trade protection measures such as quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures or antidumping duties imposed in the countries in which we operate could negatively impact our business additionally there may be substantial capital and other costs to comply with regulations andor increased security costs or insurance premiums any of which could reduce our operating results 

we obtain a portion of our principal raw materials from international sources that are subject to these same risks our compliance with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject could be challenged furthermore these laws may be modified the result of which may be to prevent or limit subsidiaries from transferring cash to us 

furthermore we are subject to certain existing and may be subject to possible future laws that limit or may limit our activities while some of our competitors may not be subject to such laws which may adversely affect our competitiveness 

changes in tax laws and regulations could affect our tax rate and our results of operations 

we are a tax resident in the united kingdom and are subject to the united kingdom corporate income tax system lyondellbasell industries nv has little or no taxable income of its own because as a holding company it does not conduct any operations through our subsidiaries we have substantial operations worldwide taxes are primarily paid on the earnings generated in various jurisdictions where our subsidiaries operate including the us the netherlands germany france and italy 

there continues to be increased attention to the tax practices of multinational companies including us tax reform proposals european union’s state aid investigations pillar one and two proposals by the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” with respect to base erosion and profit shifting and european union tax directives and their implementation although certain actions have occurred there continues to be uncertainty as to the enactment and implementation of us tax reform proposals and the oecd’s pillars one and two we continue to monitor these and other proposed tax law changes as they could increase our tax liabilities in the future if enacted 

risks related to health safety and the environment 

we cannot predict with certainty the extent of future costs under environmental health and safety and other laws and regulations and cannot guarantee they will not be material 

we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture handle or own in addition because our products are components of a variety of other enduse products we along with other members of the chemical industry are subject to potential claims related to those enduse products any substantial increase in the success of these types of claims could negatively affect our operating results 

we are subject to extensive national regional state and local environmental laws regulations directives rules and ordinances concerning 

• emissions to the air 

• discharges onto land or surface waters or into groundwater and 

• the generation handling storage transportation treatment disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials 

many of these laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations in addition some of these laws and regulations require us to meet specific financial responsibility requirements any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

although we have compliance programs and other processes intended to ensure compliance with all such regulations we are subject to the risk that our compliance with such regulations could be challenged noncompliance with certain of these regulations could result in the incurrence of additional costs penalties or assessments that could be material 

our industry is subject to extensive government regulation and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures 

compliance with regulatory requirements will result in higher operating costs such as regulatory requirements relating to emissions the security of our facilities and the transportation export or registration of our products we generally expect that regulatory controls worldwide will become increasingly more demanding but cannot accurately predict future developments 

increasingly strict environmental laws and inspection and enforcement policies could affect the handling manufacture use emission or disposal of products other materials or hazardous and nonhazardous waste stricter environmental safety and health laws regulations and enforcement policies could result in increased operating costs or capital expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations additionally we are required to have permits for our businesses and are subject to licensing regulations these permits and licenses are subject to renewal modification and in some circumstances revocation further the permits and licenses are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

we may incur substantial costs to comply with climate change legislation and related regulatory initiatives 

there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated international national and state laws focusing on greenhouse gas “ghg” reduction these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future laws and regulations in this field continue to evolve and while they are likely to be increasingly widespread and stringent at this stage it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation under the 2015 paris agreement parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change agreed to undertake ambitious efforts to reduce ghg emissions and strengthen adaptation to the effects of climate change in february 2021 the us recommitted to the paris agreement after having withdrawn in august 2017 other regions in which we operate including in particular the european union are preparing national legislation and protection plans to implement their emission reduction commitments under the agreement in december 2019 the european union member countries endorsed the objective to make the european union climateneutral by 2050 and a year later agreed to cut ghg emissions by at least 55 by 2030 compared with 1990 both commitments were enshrined in june 2021 in the european union climate law in addition nongovernmental organizations have been active in filing lawsuits against governments and private parties in various jurisdictions around the world seeking enforcement of existing laws and new requirements to reduce ghg emissions in one case decided in the netherlands in may 2021 plaintiffs obtained a ruling ordering royal dutch shell to reduce its scope 1 2 and 3 co2 emissions by 45 by 2030 these types of laws regulations and litigation results could increase the cost of purchased energy and increase costs of compliance in various locations 

our operations in europe participate in the european union emissions trading system “ets” and we purchase annual emission allowances to meet our obligations following the adoption of the climate law additional legislation is proposed to meet the new 2030 goals in light of these changes resulting from the commencement of ets phase iv in 2021 we expect to incur additional costs in relation to future carbon or ghg emission trading schemes 

in the us the epa promulgated federal ghg regulations under the clean air act affecting certain sources the epa issued mandatory ghg reporting requirements requirements to obtain ghg permits for certain industrial plants and ghg performance standards for some facilities addressing climate change is a stated priority of president biden and as such additional regulations and legislation are likely to be forthcoming at the us federal or state level that could result in increased operating costs for compliance or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances additionally demand for the products we produce may be reduced 

compliance with these regulations may result in increased permitting necessary for the operation of our business or for any of our growth plans difficulties in obtaining such permits could have an adverse effect on our future growth therefore any future potential regulations legislation or litigation results could impose additional operating restrictions or delays in implementing growth projects or other capital investments require us to incur increased costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

legislation and regulatory initiatives could lead to a decrease in demand for our products 

new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health safety and the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products initiatives by governments and private interest groups will potentially require increased toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us for example in the united states the national toxicology program “ntp” is a federal interagency program that seeks to identify and select for study chemicals and other substances to evaluate potential human health hazards in the european union the regulation on registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals “reach” is regulation designed to identify the intrinsic properties of chemical substances assess hazards and risks of the substances and identify and implement the risk management measures to protect humans and the environment in october 2020 the european commission published a chemicals strategy for sustainability which set forth plans for introducing significant changes to reach that could result in additional restrictions on chemicals used or produced by us 

assessments under ntp reach or similar programs or regulations in other jurisdictions may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals we use or produce and may result in additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of those chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

the physical impacts of climate change can negatively impact our facilities and operations 

potential physical impacts of climate change include increased frequency and severity of hurricanes and floods as well as freezing conditions tornadoes and global sea level rise although we have preparedness plans in place designed to minimize impacts and enhance safety should an event occur it could have the potential to disrupt our supply chain and operations a number of our facilities are located on the us gulf coast which has been impacted by hurricanes that have required us to temporarily shut down operations at those sites our sites rely on rivers for transportation that may experience restrictions in times of drought or other unseasonal weather variation in addition scarcity of water and drought conditions due to climate change could reduce the availability of fresh water needed to produce our products which could increase our costs of operations 

increased regulation or deselection of plastic could lead to a decrease in demand growth for some of our products 

there is a growing concern with the accumulation of plastic including microplastics and other packaging waste in the environment additionally plastics have recently faced increased public backlash and scrutiny policy measures to address this concern are being discussed or implemented by governments at all levels in 2019 the international treaty governing transboundary shipments of waste the basel convention was amended to clarify its applicability to plastic waste the european commission has been undertaking a series of actions under its strategy for plastics in a circular economy including adoption of the single use plastics directive in 2019 which introduced policy measures for single use plastics including bans product design requirements extended producer responsibility obligations and labeling requirements member states were required to transpose these measures into national law by july 2021 in addition a host of singleuse plastic bans and taxes have been passed by countries around the world and counties and municipalities throughout the us increased regulation of or prohibition on the use of certain plastic products could increase the costs incurred by our customers to use such products or otherwise limit the use of these products and could lead to a decrease in demand for pe pp and other products we make such a decrease in demand could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

failure to effectively and timely achieve our climaterelated goals could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products 

in september 2021 we set new sustainability goals for the future including with respect to circularity and ghg emissions reduction our ability to achieve these goals depends on many factors including our ability to reduce emissions from our operations through modernization and innovation reduce the emissions intensity of the electricity we buy and invest in renewables and low carbon energy in addition any future decarbonization technologies may increase our costs or we may be limited in our ability to apply them to commercial scale we may also not timely adapt to changes or methods in carbon pricing that could increase our costs and reduce our competitiveness the cost associated with our ghg emissions reduction goals could be significant failure to achieve our emissions targets could result in reputational harm changing investor sentiment regarding investment in lyondellbasell or a negative impact on access to and cost of capital 

general risk factors 

the covid19 pandemic could continue to materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in early 2020 the covid19 pandemic spread to countries worldwide and resulted in governments and other authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the disease such as travel bans and restrictions social distancing quarantines shelterinplace orders and business shutdowns among others these measures caused significant economic disruption and adversely impacted the global economy leading to reduced consumer spending and volatility in the global financial and commodities markets a return to more ordinary course of economic activity is dependent on the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic including the severity and transmission rate of the virus the extent and effectiveness of containment efforts including the spread of virus variants such as delta and omicron the availability and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments and future policy decisions made by governments across the globe as they react to evolving local and global conditions 

while we continue to work with our stakeholders including customers employees suppliers business partners and local communities to attempt to mitigate the impact of the global pandemic on our business we cannot assure that these mitigation efforts will continue to be effective or successful an extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the covid19 pandemic could have a material negative impact on our business results of operations access to sources of liquidity and financial condition 

increased it and cybersecurity threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks data products facilities and services 

increased global information cybersecurity threats and more sophisticated targeted computer crime pose a risk to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data operations and infrastructure while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including security measures employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our employees systems networks products facilities and services remain potentially vulnerable to ransomware sophisticated espionage or cyberassault depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations 

many of our businesses depend on our intellectual property our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and our inability to do so could reduce our ability to maintain our competitiveness and margins 

we have a significant worldwide patent portfolio of issued and pending patents these patents and patent applications together with proprietary technical knowhow are significant to our competitive position particularly with regard to po intermediate chemicals polyolefins licensing and catalysts we rely on the patent copyright and trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing we operate plants sell catalysts and products participate in joint ventures and license our process technology in many foreign jurisdictions including those having heightened risks for intellectual property in some of these instances we must disclose at least a portion of our technology to third parties or regulatory bodies in these cases we rely primarily on contracts and trade secret laws to protect the associated trade secrets however we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without authorization proceedings to protect these rights could be costly and we may not prevail 

the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes apparatuses technology trade secrets or proprietary knowhow could result in significantly lower revenues reduced profit margins and cash flows andor loss of market share we also may be subject to claims that our technology patents or other intellectual property infringes on a third party’s intellectual property rights unfavorable resolution of these claims could result in restrictions on our ability to deliver the related service or in a settlement that could be material to us 

adverse results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us 

we are subject to and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty irrespective of its merits litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expenditure and diversion of management attention we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations should we fail to prevail in certain matters 

if we lose key employees or are unable to attract and retain the employees we need our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and we rely heavily on our management team the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations in addition because of the reliance on our management team our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management the retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our strategies 

there is substantial and continuous competition for diverse talented engineering manufacturing and operations employees we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel and we may experience increased compensation and training costs that may not be offset by either improved productivity or higher sales we have from time to time experienced and we may continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications and may not be able to fill positions in desired geographic areas or at all 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may adversely affect the valuation of pension obligations the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rates used to measure pension obligations the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets may result in corresponding increases and decreases in the value of plan assets particularly equity securities or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets any changes in key actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate or mortality rate would impact the valuation of pension obligations affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years 

nearly all of our current pension plans have projected benefit obligations that exceed the fair value of the plan assets as of december 31 2021 the aggregate deficit was 1015 million any declines in the fair values of the pension plans’ assets could require additional payments by us in order to maintain specified funding levels 

our pension plans are subject to legislative and regulatory requirements of applicable jurisdictions which could include under certain circumstances local governmental authority to terminate the plan

environmental matters 

from time to time we and our joint ventures receive notices or inquiries from government entities regarding alleged violations of environmental laws and regulations pertaining to among other things the disposal emission and storage of chemical and petroleum substances including hazardous wastes us securities and exchange commission rules require disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and the proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that we reasonably believe could exceed 300000 the matters below are disclosed solely pursuant to that requirement and we do not believe that any of these proceedings will have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

in september 2013 the us environmental protection agency “epa” region v issued a notice and finding of violation alleging violations at our morris illinois facility related to flaring activity the notice generally alleges failures to monitor steam usage and improper flare operations in the fall of 2020 epa referred the matter to the us department of justice “doj” and epa headquarters for civil judicial enforcement we are currently engaged in settlement discussions with epa and doj 

in connection with an enforcement initiative of epa regarding flare emissions at petrochemical plants we have settled with epa and doj in order to resolve claims initiated in july 2014 related to alleged improper operation and maintenance of flares at four of our us facilities the consent decree related to the settlement was entered by the us district court for the southern district of texas in january 2022 under the terms of the settlement we paid a penalty of 34 million in january 2022 and will conduct fence line monitoring and make investments in equipment at the facilities 

in march 2018 the cologne germany local court issued a regulatory fine notice of €18 million arising from a pipeline leak near our wesseling germany facility we expect the cologne prosecutor to issue a corresponding payment request which will resolve the matter 

in february 2020 the state of texas filed suit against houston refining lp a subsidiary of lyondellbasell in travis county district court seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief for violations of the texas clean air act related to several emission events in july 2020 harris county texas petitioned to intervene in the lawsuit and the state added additional claims to its petition relating to selfreported deviations of houston refinings air operating permit 

on july 27 2021 approximately 160000 pounds of liquid process material containing primarily acetic acid was released from a reactor at the la porte acetic acid unit in october 2021 the texas commission on environmental quality “tceq” issued a notice of enforcement for the incident in november 2021 the state of texas filed a petition on behalf of the tceq seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties for unauthorized air pollution and regulatory nuisance related to the incident we are currently engaged in settlement discussions with the state to resolve this matter

overview 

our 2021 results reflect robust demand for our products and tight market conditions during 2021 relative to 2020 ebitda increased largely due to margin improvements in our op—americas op—eai and id segments 

our 2021 cash generation allowed us to complete our goal of reducing longterm debt by 4 billion during the year and demonstrated our commitment to a solid investmentgrade credit rating we do not plan to pursue further longterm debt reduction in 2022 during 2021 we repurchased 52 million shares and increased our annual dividend for the eleventh consecutive year 

during the second quarter of 2021 we invested 104 million to purchase a 50 interest in a joint venture with the china petroleum  chemical corporation “sinopec” which will commission a new propylene oxide and styrene monomer unit in china in 2022 

results of operations for the periods discussed are presented in the table below 



results of operations 

revenues —revenues increased 18420 million or 66 in 2021 compared to 2020 average sales prices in 2021 were higher for many of our products as sales prices generally correlate with crude oil prices which increased relative to 2020 these higher prices led to a 62 increase in revenue higher sales volumes driven by increased demand resulted in a revenue increase of 3 favorable foreign exchange impacts resulted in a revenue increase of 1 

cost of sales —cost of sales increased 13038 million or 54 in 2021 compared to 2020 this increase primarily related to higher feedstock and energy costs fluctuations in our cost of sales are generally driven by changes in feedstock and energy costs feedstock and energy related costs generally represent approximately 70 to 80 of cost of sales other variable costs account for approximately 10 of cost of sales on an annual basis and fixed operating costs consisting primarily of expenses associated with employee compensation depreciation and amortization and maintenance range from approximately 15 to 20 in each annual period 

impairments —results for our refining segment include noncash impairment charges of 624 million and 582 million recognized in 2021 and 2020 respectively see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding impairment charges 

sga expense —selling general and administrative “sga” expense increased 115 million or 10 in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher employeerelated expenses 

operating income —operating income increased by 5214 million or 334 in 2021 compared to 2020 in 2021 operating income increased for our op—americas op—eai id refining technology and aps segments by 3382 million 816 million 466 million 328 million 184 million and 60 million respectively results for each of our business segments are discussed further in the segment analysis section below 

income from equity investments —income from equity method investments increased 205 million or 80 in 2021 compared to 2020 higher demand coupled with industry supply constraints resulted in improved margins for our joint ventures in our op—americas and op—eai segments 

income taxes— our effective income tax rates of 171 in 2021 and 31 in 2020 resulted in a tax provision of 1163 million and a tax benefit of 43 million respectively 

the 2021 effective income tax rate of 171 which is lower than the us statutory tax rate of 21 was favorably impacted by exempt income 45 return to accrual adjustments primarily from a tax benefit associated with an election made in 2021 to stepup certain italian assets to fair market value retroactively 18 and the impact of the coronavirus aid relief and economic security “cares” act 09 partially offset by the effects of earnings in various countries notably in europe with higher statutory tax rates 11 and us state and local income taxes 12 

the 2020 effective income tax rate of 31 which is lower than the us statutory tax rate of 21 was favorably impacted by tax law changes including the cares act 215 coupled with exempt income 104 partially offset by changes in unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions 70 

during 2021 and 2020 we recorded an overall tax benefit in relation to the cares act of approximately 64 million and 300 million respectively due to our 2020 us tax losses which we carried back to tax years with a higher tax rate for additional information see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

comprehensive income— we had comprehensive income of 5757 million in 2021 and 1268 million in 2020 comprehensive income increased by 4489 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher net income net favorable changes in defined pension and other postretirement benefits and net favorable impacts of financial derivative instruments primarily driven by periodic changes in benchmark interest rates these increases were partially offset by net unfavorable impacts of unrealized changes in foreign currency translation adjustments 

we recognized defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans pretax gains of 291 million and pretax losses of 51 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively in 2021 changes in actuarial assumptions primarily related to an increase in discount rates and higher actual returns versus expected returns on plan assets resulted in a pretax gain of 214 million in 2021 pretax gains of 77 million related to the amortization of accumulated actuarial losses and settlements were reclassified to other income net in 2020 pretax losses of 109 million were recognized due to the decrease in discount rates and higher actual returns versus expected returns on plan assets pretax losses were partially offset by pretax gains of 58 million primarily due to amortization of accumulated actuarial losses reclassified to other income net 

in 2021 the cumulative aftertax effect of our derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was a net gain of 72 million the weakening of the euro against the us dollar in 2021 and periodic changes in benchmark interest rates resulted in a pretax gain of 207 million related to our crosscurrency swaps in 2021 pretax losses of 216 million related to our crosscurrency swaps were reclassified to other income net in 2021 we recognized pretax gains of 75 million related to forwardstarting interest rate swaps primarily driven by changes in benchmark interest rates the remaining change relates to our commodity cash flow hedges 

the predominant functional currency for our operations outside of the us is the euro relative to the us dollar the value of the euro weakened during 2021 resulting in net losses related to unrealized changes in foreign currency translation impacts which are reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income these losses were partially offset by a pretax gain of 199 million related to the effective portion of our net investment hedges 

segment analysis 

we use earnings from continuing operations before interest income taxes and depreciation and amortization “ebitda” as our measure of profitability for segment reporting purposes this measure of segment operating results is used by our chief operating decision maker to assess the performance of and allocate resources to our operating segments intersegment eliminations and items that are not directly related or allocated to business operations such as foreign exchange gains losses and components of pension and other postretirement benefit costs other than service cost are included in “other” for additional information related to our operating segments as well as a reconciliation of ebitda to its nearest generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” measure income from continuing operations before income taxes see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements 

our continuing operations are managed through six reportable segments op—americas op—eai id aps refining and technology the following tables reflect selected financial information for our reportable segments 





olefins and polyolefins–americas segment 

overview —ebitda improved in 2021 relative to 2020 driven by olefin and combined polyolefin margin improvements 

in calculating the impact of margin and volume on ebitda consistent with industry practice management offsets revenues and volumes related to ethylene coproducts against the cost to produce ethylene volume and price impacts of ethylene coproducts are reported in margin 

ethylene raw materials —ethylene and its coproducts are produced from two major raw material groups 

• ngls principally ethane and propane the prices of which are generally affected by natural gas prices and 

• crude oilbased liquids “liquids” or “heavy liquids” including naphtha condensates and gas oils the prices of which are generally related to crude oil prices 

we have flexibility to vary the raw material mix and process conditions in our us olefins plants in order to maximize profitability as market prices fluctuate for both feedstocks and products although prices of crudebased liquids and natural gas liquids are generally related to crude oil and natural gas prices during specific periods the relationships among these materials and benchmarks may vary significantly in 2021 and 2020 approximately 60 of the raw materials used in our north american crackers was ethane 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the op—americas segment including income from equity investments which is a component of ebitda 



revenues —revenues increased by 7727 million or 106 in 2021 compared to 2020 higher average sales prices resulted in a 92 increase in revenue in 2021 primarily driven by tight market conditions volume improvements resulted in a revenue increase of 14 primarily due to the 2020 acquisition of our 50 interest in the louisiana joint venture 

ebitda —ebitda increased by 3463 million or 191 in 2021 compared to 2020 largely driven by margin improvements olefins results led to a 109 increase in ebitda driven by higher margins as sales prices outpaced higher feedstock and energy costs higher polyethylene and polypropylene results led to a 48 and 29 increase in ebitda respectively primarily due to polyolefin sales price increases which outpaced higher feedstock costs 

olefins and polyolefins–europe asia international segment 

overview — ebitda increased in 2021 compared to 2020 mainly as a result of higher combined polyolefins margins due to strong demand and tight markets 

in calculating the impact of margin and volume on ebitda consistent with industry practice management offsets revenues and volumes related to ethylene coproducts against the cost to produce ethylene volume and price impacts of ethylene coproducts are reported in margin 

ethylene raw materials —in europe heavy liquids are the primary raw materials for our ethylene production and represents approximately twothirds of the raw materials used in 2021 and 2020 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the op—eai segment including income from equity investments which is a component of ebitda 



revenues —revenues increased by 5123 million or 61 in 2021 compared to 2020 average sales prices in 2021 were higher across most products as sales prices generally correlate with crude oil prices which on average increased compared to 2020 these higher average sales prices were responsible for a 52 increase in revenue volume improvements resulted in a revenue increase of 6 primarily due to strong demand in combination with tight market supply favorable foreign exchange impacts resulted in a revenue increase of 3 in 2021 

ebitda —ebitda increased by 923 million or 112 in 2021 compared to 2020 polyethylene and polypropylene results improved resulting in an ebitda increase of 55 and 46 respectively these improvements were driven by higher margins as price increases outpaced higher feedstock costs higher income from our equity investments led to an increase in ebitda of 15 mainly attributable to higher polyolefins margins associated with increased demand foreign exchange impacts which on average were favorable resulted in a ebitda increase of 4 

intermediates and derivatives segment 

overview— ebitda increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily driven by higher margins across most businesses due to tight market supply from industry outages coupled with strong demand 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the id segment including income from equity investments which is a component of ebitda 



revenues —revenues increased by 3911 million or 62 in 2021 compared to 2020 higher average sales prices resulted in a 64 increase in revenue in 2021 as sales prices generally correlate with crude oil prices which on average increased compared to 2020 sales volumes declined in 2021 resulting in a 3 decrease in revenue due to the impact of unusually cold temperatures and associated electrical power outages that led to shutdowns of our manufacturing facilities in texas in early 2021 coupled with unplanned maintenance activities in 2021 favorable foreign exchange impacts resulted in a revenue increase of 1 in 2021 

ebitda —ebitda increased 545 million or 65 in 2021 compared to 2020 our propylene oxide and derivatives and intermediate chemicals results improved resulting in an ebitda increase of 54 and 18 respectively these improvements were primarily a result of higher margins due to strong demand coupled with tight market supply resulting from industry outages higher oxyfuels and related products results led to a 6 increase in ebitda primarily driven by margin improvement as a result of improved demand and higher gasoline prices results declined 4 as a result of site closure costs associated with the exit of our ethanol business 

advanced polymer solutions segment 

overview— ebitda for our aps segment increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher advanced polymer margins 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the aps segment 



revenues —revenues increased in 2021 by 1232 million or 31 compared to 2020 average sales price increased resulting in a 25 increase in revenue in 2021 as sales prices generally correlate with raw material costs and product demand  higher sales volumes resulted in a 3 increase in revenue stemming from higher demand foreign exchange impacts resulted in a revenue increase of 3 in 2021 

ebitda —ebitda increased in 2021 by 31 million or 8 compared to 2020 higher advanced polymers results led to an ebitda increase of 13 driven by margin improvements resulting from increased construction demand results benefited 10 from the absence of integration costs incurred in 2020 associated with the acquisition of a schulman inc these ebitda improvements were offset by lifo inventory charges which resulted in a 12 reduction in ebitda compounding and solutions results remained relatively unchanged during 2021 

refining segment 

overview —ebitda for our refining segment increased in 2021 relative to 2020 primarily due to higher margins 

the following table sets forth selected financial information and heavy crude oil processing rates for the refining segment and the us refining market margins for the applicable periods “brent” is a light sweet crude oil and is one of the main benchmark prices for purchases of oil worldwide “maya” is a heavy sour crude oil grade produced in mexico that is a relevant benchmark for heavy sour crude oils in the us gulf coast market references to industry benchmarks for refining market margins are to industry prices reported by platts a division of sp global 



revenues —revenues increased by 3275 million or 69 in 2021 compared to 2020 higher product prices led to a revenue increase of 71 in 2021 due to an average brent crude oil price increase of approximately 28 per barrel sales volume changes resulted in a 2 decline in revenues as higher run rates were offset by changes in product mix 

ebitda —ebitda increased by 247 million or 28in 2021 compared to 2020 this increase was primarily driven by margin improvements due to an increase in the maya 211 market margin resulting from higher demand for refined products this was partially offset by margin declines driven by higher costs for renewable identification numbers “rins” of approximately 1 per gallon 

during 2021 and 2020 we recognized noncash impairment charges of 624 million and 582 million respectively for additional information see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

we are currently weighing strategic options for our refining segment including a potential sale of our houston refinery any strategic option pursued for the houston refinery remains subject to the approval of our board of directors and assuming such approval is obtained may require certain regulatory approvals or other closing conditions 

technology segment 

overview —the technology segment recognizes revenues related to the sale of polyolefin catalysts and the licensing of chemical and polyolefin process technologies these revenues are offset in part by the costs incurred in the production of catalysts licensing and services activities and research and development “rd” activities in 2021 and 2020 our technology segment incurred approximately half of all rd costs ebitda for our technology segment increased in 2021 compared to 2020 largely due to higher licensing revenues and catalyst volumes 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the technology segment 



revenues —revenues increased by 184 million or 28 in 2021 compared to 2020 higher catalyst volumes resulted in a 10 increase in revenue in 2021 primarily driven by strong demand licensing revenues increased by 15 in 2021 favorable foreign exchange impacts increased revenue by 3 in 2021 

ebitda —ebitda in 2021 increased by 190 million or 59 compared to 2020 higher licensing revenues led to an ebitda improvement of 40 in 2021 favorable foreign exchange impacts resulted in an ebitda increase of 3 in 2021 the remaining increases was largely driven by higher catalyst sales volumes as a result of improved global demand 

financial condition 

operating investing and financing activities of continuing operations which are discussed below are presented in the following table 



operating activities —cash provided by operating activities of 7695 million in 2021 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items and cash used by the main components of working capital–accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable 

in 2021 the main components of working capital used 960 million of cash driven by an increase in inventories and accounts receivable partially offset by an increase in accounts payable the increase in inventories was primarily due to an increase in raw material costs coupled with an increase in inventory to levels required to support improved demand and in anticipation of turnarounds in 2022 the increase in accounts receivable was driven by higher revenues across most businesses primarily driven by higher average sales prices the increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by increased raw material and energy costs

for additional information related to our swaps and currency contracts see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

we plan to fund our ongoing working capital capital expenditures debt service dividends and other cash requirements with our current available liquidity and cash from operations which could be affected by general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory business and other factors many of which are beyond our control cash and cash equivalents cash from our shortterm investments cash from operating activities proceeds from the issuance of debt or a combination thereof may be used to fund the purchase of shares under our share repurchase authorization 

we intend to continue to declare and pay quarterly dividends with the goal of increasing the dividend over time after giving consideration to our cash balances and expected results from operations our focus on funding our dividends while remaining committed to a strong investment grade balance sheet continues to be the foundation of our capital allocation strategy 

cash and liquid investments 

as of december 31 2021 we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities classified as shortterm investments totaling 1481 million which includes 1136 million in jurisdictions outside of the us principally in the united kingdom there are currently no legal or economic restrictions that would materially impede our transfers of cash 

credit arrangements 

at december 31 2021 we had total debt including current maturities of 11614 million and 218 million of outstanding letters of credit bank guarantees and surety bonds issued under uncommitted credit facilities 

we had total unused availability under our credit facilities of 3946 million at december 31 2021 which included the following 

• 3046 million under our 3250 million senior revolving credit facility which backs our 2500 million commercial paper program in november 2021 we entered into a second amendment and restatement of our credit agreement to increase our availability under the senior revolving credit facility from 2500 million to 3250 million see note 11 for additional detail availability under this facility is net of outstanding borrowings outstanding letters of credit provided under the facility and notes issued under our commercial paper program at december 31 2021 we had 204 million of outstanding commercial paper net of discount and no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under this facility and 

• 900 million under our 900 million us receivables facility availability under this facility is subject to a borrowing base of eligible receivables which is reduced by outstanding borrowings and letters of credit if any at december 31 2021 we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under this facility in june 2021 we extended the term of the facility to june 2024 in accordance with the terms of the agreement 

at any time and from time to time we may repay or redeem our outstanding debt including purchases of our outstanding bonds in the open market through privately negotiated transactions or a combination thereof in each case using cash and cash equivalents cash from our shortterm investments cash from operating activities proceeds from the issuance of debt or proceeds from asset divestitures any repayment or redemption of our debt will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors in connection with such repurchases or redemptions we may incur cash and noncash charges which could be material in the period in which they are incurred 

in accordance with our current interest rate risk management strategy and subject to management’s evaluation of market conditions and the availability of favorable interest rates among other factors we may from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements to economically convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to variable rate debt or convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 

share repurchases 

in may 2021 our shareholders approved a proposal to authorize us to repurchase up to 340 million ordinary shares through november 28 2022 “2021 share repurchase authorization” which superseded any prior repurchase authorizations our share repurchase authorization does not have a stated dollar amount and purchases may be made through open market purchases private market transactions or other structured transactions repurchased shares could be retired or used for general corporate purposes including for various employee benefit and compensation plans the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased is not necessarily an indication of the number of shares that will ultimately be purchased in 2021 we purchased 52 million shares under our share repurchase authorization for 477 million 

as of february 22 2022 we had approximately 272 million shares remaining under the current authorization the timing and amounts of additional shares repurchased if any will be determined based on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors including any additional authorizations approved by our shareholders in addition cash and cash equivalents cash from our shortterm investments cash from operating activities proceeds from the issuance of debt or a combination thereof may be used to fund the purchase of shares under our share repurchase authorization for additional information related to our share repurchase authorization see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

capital budget 

in 2022 we are planning to invest approximately 21 billion in capital expenditures which includes approximately 79 million for investments in our us and european po joint ventures and louisiana joint venture approximately 40 of the 2022 budget is planned for profitgenerating growth projects primarily our potba plant with the remaining budget supporting sustaining maintenance 

cash requirements from contractual and other obligations 

as part of our ongoing operations we enter into contractual arrangements that may require us to make future cash payments under certain circumstances our cash requirements related to contractual and other obligations primarily consist of purchase obligations principal and interest payments on outstanding debt lease payments pension and other postretirement benefits and income taxes for more information regarding our debt arrangements lease obligations pension and other postretirement benefits and income taxes see notes 11 12 14 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements respectively 

we are party to obligations to purchase raw material s utilities and industrial gases which are designed to ensure sources of supply and are not expected to be in excess of normal requirements these purchase arrangements include provisions which state minimum purchase quantities however in the event we do not take the contractual minimum volumes we are obligated to compensate the vendor only for any resulting economic losses they suffer no material fees were paid to vendors for such losses in 2021 assuming that contractual minimum volumes are purchased at contract prices as of december 31 2021 these commitments represent approximately 20 of our annual cost of sales with a weighted average remaining term of 7 years 

we also have purchase obligations under takeorpay agreements which require us to either buy and take delivery of a minimum quantity of goods or to pay for any shortfall these arrangements primarily relate to product offtake agreements with joint ventures located in poland  no material shortfall was paid for quantities not taken under these contracts in 2021 when valued using a contract price as of december 31 2021 these commitments represent approximately 5 of our annual cost of sales with a weighted average remaining term of 12 years 

current business outlook 

we expect continued strength in demand for our products supply chain disruptions and virus surges have been restraining pentup consumer demand across the global economy as vaccinations facilitate a more sustainable global reopening and supply chains normalize our businesses should benefit from continued strong demand for both goods and services we are closely monitoring rising feedstock and energy costs particularly at our european operations elevated levels of ethylene industry maintenance activities scheduled for the first half of 2022 are likely to constrain supply we expect tight markets for acetyls and propylene oxide will continue to drive strong profitability within our id segment further we expect to expand our production with the commissioning of new facilities within our id segment in china and the us during 2022 in january our advanced polymers solutions segment benefited from increased order volumes for our products used in automotive production 

planned maintenance in 2022 for our op—americas op—eai and id segments is expected to impact ebitda by approximately 125 million 60 million and 80 million respectively 

related party transactions 

we have related party transactions with our joint venture partners we believe that such transactions are effected on terms substantially no more or less favorable than those that would have been agreed upon by unrelated parties on an arm’s length basis see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional related party disclosures 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management applies those accounting policies that it believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the us see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management and updated periodically based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment 

management believes the following accounting policies and estimates and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them are critical in understanding our reported operating results and financial condition 

inventories —we account for our raw materials workinprogress and finished goods inventories using the lastin firstout “lifo” method of accounting 

the cost of raw materials which represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses and energy costs generally follow price trends for crude oil andor natural gas crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to many factors including changes in economic conditions 

since our inventory consists of manufactured products derived from crude oil natural gas natural gas liquids and correlated materials as well as the associated feedstocks and intermediate chemicals our inventory market values are generally influenced by changes in the benchmark of crude oil and heavy liquid values and prices for manufactured finished goods the degree of influence of a particular benchmark may vary from period to period as the composition of the dollar value lifo pools change due to natural inventory composition changes variation in pricing from period to period does not necessarily result in a linear lower of cost or market “lcm” impact additionally an lcm condition may arise due to a volumetric decline in a particular material that had previously provided a positive impact within a pool as a result market valuations and lcm conditions are dependent upon the composition and mix of materials on hand at the balance sheet date in the measurement of an lcm adjustment the numeric input value for determining the crude oil market price includes pricing that is weighted by volume of inventories held at a point in time including wti brent and maya crude oils 

as indicated above fluctuation in the prices of crude oil natural gas and correlated products from period to period may result in the recognition of charges to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in periods of falling prices and the reversal of those charges in subsequent interim periods as market prices recover accordingly our cost of sales and results of operations may be affected by such fluctuations 

no lcm inventory valuation charge was recorded in 2021 and we do not believe any of our inventory balance at yearend is at risk for impairment given the inherent volatility in the prices of our finished goods and raw materials sustained price declines could result in lcm inventory valuation charges during 2020 we recognized an lcm inventory valuation charge of 16 million related to the decline in pricing for our raw material and finished goods inventories 

in the first quarter of 2020 we recognized lcm inventory valuation charges of 419 million which was driven by a decline in pricing for many of our raw material and finished goods inventories during the second third and fourth quarters of 2020 we recognized lcm inventory valuation benefits of 96 million 160 million and 147 million respectively as market prices began to recover subsequent to the first quarter of 2020 

market price volatility for crude oil heavy liquids and ethylene were the primary contributors to the lcm inventory valuation charges and representative prices used to determine the lcm inventory valuation charges recognized during 2020 ranged from 1214 to 4175 per barrel for crude oil 1350 to 5107 per barrel for heavy liquids and 205 to 767 per ton for ethylene 

longlived assets impairment assessment —the need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced a weakened outlook for profitability a significant reduction in margins an expectation that a longlived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment if the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows for an asset group is less than the asset group’s carrying value fair value is calculated for the asset group using an income approach or a market approach when appropriate and the carrying value is written down to the calculated fair value for purposes of impairment evaluation longlived assets including finitelived intangible assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified 

significant judgment is involved in developing estimates of future cash flows since the results are based on forecasted financial information prepared using significant assumptions which may include among other things projected changes in supply and demand fundamentals including industrywide capacity our planned utilization rate and enduser demand new technological developments capital expenditures new competitors with significant raw material or other cost advantages changes associated with world economies the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries uncertainties associated with governmental actions and other economic conditions such estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment and business performance reviews 

when an income approach is used to estimate fair value of our longlived assets the cash flows are discounted using a rate that is based on a variety of factors including market and economic conditions operational risk regulatory risk and political risk this discount rate is also compared to recent observable market transactions if possible 

houston refinery impairment —during the fourth quarter of 2021 and during the third quarter of 2020 we identified impairment triggers relating to our houston refinery’s asset group which resulted in noncash impairment charges of 624 million and 582 million respectively refer to note 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

in 2021 the estimate of the houston refinery’s undiscounted pretax cash flows utilized significant assumptions including management’s best estimates of the expected future cash flows the estimated useful lives of the asset group and the residual value of the refinery these estimates required considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions such as future commodity prices margins on refined products operating rates and capital expenditures including repairs and maintenance as a result there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our impairment determination will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future the houston refinery’s estimated fair value was calculated using a market approach which utilized unobservable inputs which generally consist of market information provided by unrelated third parties 

in 2020 the estimates of the houston refinery’s undiscounted pretax cash flows utilized significant assumptions similar to those utilized during 2021 the houston refinery’s estimated fair value was determined using an income approach that was based on projected financial information and significant inputs that were not observable in the market 

should our estimates and assumptions significantly change in future periods it is possible that we may determine future impairment charges 

an estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable given the numerous assumptions including pricing volumes discount rates and market information provided by unrelated third parties that can materially affect our estimates that is unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions 

equity method investments impairment —investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment when there are indicators of a loss in value such as a lack of sustained earnings capacity or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount 

when it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value when determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline the investee’s financial condition and nearterm prospects and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the value of the investment management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on the income approach andor market approach for the income approach the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants for the market approach since quoted market prices are usually not available we utilize market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded industrial gases companies 

goodwill —as of december 31 2021 we had goodwill of 1875 million of this amount 1357 million is related to the acquisition of a schulman in 2018 which is included in our aps segment and is mainly attributed to acquired workforce and expected synergies the remaining goodwill at december 31 2021 primarily represents the tax effect of the differences between the tax and book basis of our assets and liabilities resulting from the revaluation of those assets and liabilities to fair value in connection with the company’s emergence from bankruptcy and freshstart accounting in 2010 additional information on the amount of goodwill allocated to our reporting units appears in note 7 and note 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill of a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors assessed for each of the reporting units include but are not limited to changes in longterm commodity prices discount rates competitive environments planned capacity cost factors such as raw material prices and financial performance of the reporting units if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a quantitative test is required 

we also have the option to proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test under the quantitative impairment test the fair value of each reporting unit calculated using a discounted cash flow model is compared to its carrying value including goodwill the discounted cash flow model inherently utilizes a significant number of estimates and assumptions including operating margins tax rates discount rates capital expenditures and working capital changes if the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds its fair value an impairment charge equal to the excess would be recognized up to a maximum amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

for 2021 and 2020 management performed a qualitative impairment assessment of our reporting units which indicated that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their carrying value including goodwill accordingly a quantitative goodwill impairment test was not required and no goodwill impairment was recognized in 2021 or 2020 

longterm employee benefit costs —our costs for longterm employee benefits particularly pension and other postretirement medical and life insurance benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is management’s responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent its best estimates of the future effects of those uncertainties and to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors 

the current benefit service costs as well as the existing liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis the discount rate is a current rate related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled our assumed discount rate is based on yield information for highquality corporate bonds with durations comparable to the expected cash settlement of our obligations for the purpose of measuring the benefit obligations at december 31 2021 we used a weighted average discount rate of 280 for the us plans which reflects the different terms of the related benefit obligations the weighted average discount rate used to measure obligations for nonus plans at december 31 2021 was 145 reflecting market interest rates the discount rates in effect at december 31 2021 will be used to measure net periodic benefit cost during 2022 

the benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost of other postretirement medical benefits are also measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits as of december 31 2021 the assumed rate of increase for our us plans was 63 decreasing to 45 in 2029 and thereafter 

the net periodic benefit cost of pension benefits included in expense is affected by the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption investment returns that are recognized currently in net income represent the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets applied to a marketrelated value of plan assets which is defined as the market value of assets the expected rate of return on plan assets is a longerterm rate and is expected to change less frequently than the current assumed discount rate reflecting longterm market expectations rather than current fluctuations in market conditions 

the weighted average expected longterm rate of return on assets in our us plans of 725 is based on the average level of earnings that our independent pension investment advisor advised could be expected to be earned over time the weighted average expected longterm rate of return on assets in our nonus plans of 144 is based on expectations and asset allocations that vary by region the asset allocations are summarized in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets management’s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 

net periodic pension cost recognized each year includes the expected asset earnings rather than the actual earnings or loss along with other gains and losses this unrecognized amount to the extent it cumulatively exceeds 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of the plan assets for the respective plan is recognized as additional net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service period of the participants in each plan 

the following table reflects the sensitivity of the benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans to changes in the actuarial assumptions 



the sensitivity of our postretirement benefit plans obligations and net periodic benefit costs to changes in actuarial assumptions are reflected in the following table 



additional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

accruals for taxes based on income —the determination of our provision for income taxes and the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities is subject to management’s estimates and judgments due to the complexity of the tax laws and regulations in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of these complex laws and regulations 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 

we recognize future tax benefits to the extent that the realization of these benefits is more likely than not our current provision for income taxes is impacted by the recognition and release of valuation allowances related to net deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions further changes to these valuation allowances may impact our future provision for income taxes which will include no tax benefit with respect to losses incurred and no tax expense with respect to income generated in these countries until the respective valuation allowance is eliminated 

we recognize the financial statement benefits with respect to an uncertain income tax position that we have taken or may take on an income tax return when we believe it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our management of commodity price risk foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk 

commodity price risk —prices for our products and raw materials are subject to changes in supply and demand natural gas crude oil and refined products along with feedstocks for ethylene and propylene production constitute the main commodity exposures pricing terms in our raw material contracts are generally indexed to market prices changes in market prices for raw materials generally correlate with market prices for our products in certain sales contracts we may negotiate pricing terms to better align with changes in raw material costs we also selectively enter commodity swap and futures contracts to manage commodity price risk the impact of a 10 change in commodity prices at december 31 2021 and 2020 would not materially impact the fair values of our commodity derivative contracts 

foreign exchange risk —we manufacture and market our products in many countries throughout the world and as a result are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our reporting currency is the us dollar many of our operating entities use the euro as their functional currency translation adjustments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income 

we enter foreign currency derivatives that are designated as net investment hedges to reduce the volatility in shareholders’ equity resulting from translation adjustments associated with our net investments in foreign operations we also enter foreign currency contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges to manage the variability in cash flows associated with intercompany debt balances the table below illustrates the impact on other comprehensive loss of a 10 fluctuation in the foreign currency rate associated with the hedges at december 31 



some of our consolidated entities enter transactions that are not denominated in their functional currency this results in exposure to foreign currency risk for financial instruments including but not limited to thirdparty and intercompany receivables and payables and intercompany loans 

our policy is to maintain a balanced position in foreign currencies to minimize exchange gains and losses arising from changes in exchange rates we maintain risk management control practices to monitor the foreign currency risk attributable to our intercompany and third party outstanding foreign currency balances these practices involve the centralization of our exposure to underlying currencies that are not subject to central bank andor country specific restrictions by centralizing most of our foreign currency exposure into one subsidiary we are able to take advantage of natural offsets thereby reducing the overall impact of changes in foreign currency rates on our earnings 

to minimize the effects of our net currency exchange exposures we enter into forward exchange contracts and crosscurrency swaps we also engage in shortterm forward exchange contracts to manage our net exposure to foreign currencies as economic hedges changes in the fair value of these foreign currency contracts are reporting in the consolidated statements of income and offset the currency exchange results recognized on foreign currency balances 

other income net in the consolidated statements of income reflects net foreign currency losses of 2 million and 7 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively as of december 31 2021 our foreign currency contracts that are accounted for as economic hedges mature between january 2022 and march 2022  inclusively had an aggregate notional amount of 222 million and the fair value was a net liability of 1 million  a 10 fluctuation compared to the us dollar would have resulted in an additional impact to earnings of approximately 4 million and 5 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively 

interest rate risk —we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our fixedrate and variablerate debt fluctuations in interest rates impact the fair value of fixedrate debt and expose us to the risk that we may need to refinance debt at higher rates fluctuations in interest rates impact interest expense from our variablerate debt to minimize earnings at risk as part of our interest rate risk management strategy we target to maintain floatingrate debt through the use of interest rate swaps and issuance of variablerate debt equal to our cash and cash equivalents as those assets earn interest based on floatingrates 

preissuance interest rate —to mitigate the risk that benchmark interest rates may increase in connection with future financing activities we adopted a preissuance interest rate strategy under which we entered forwardstarting interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges we estimate that a 10 change in market interest rates as of december 31 2021 and 2020 would change the fair value of these forwardstarting interest rate swaps by approximately 48 million and 44 million respectively 

fixedrate debt —we enter into interest rate swaps that effectively convert our fixedrate debt to variablerate debt these interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges at december 31 2021 and 2020 the total notional amount of these interest rate swaps was 1163 million and 122 million respectively 

at december 31 2021 after giving consideration to the fixedrate debt that we have effectively converted to variablerate debt approximately 90 of our debt portfolio on a gross basis incurred interest at a fixedrate and the remaining 10 of the portfolio incurred interest at a variablerate we estimate that a 10 change in market interest rates as of december 31 2021 and 2020 would not materially impact the fair value of these interest rate swaps 

variablerate debt —at december 31 2021 our variable ratedebt consisted of 204 million outstanding under our commercial paper program we also have available borrowing capacity under our 3250 million senior revolving credit facility and our 900 million us receivables facility at december 31 2021 there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities based on our average variablerate debt outstanding per year we estimate that a 10 change in market interest rates as of december 31 2021 and 2020 would not materially impact the fair value of these facilities

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

overview 

lyondellbasell industries nv is a global independent chemical company and was incorporated as a naamloze vennootschap under dutch law on october 15 2009 unless otherwise indicated the “company” “we” “our” “us” and “lyondellbasell” are used in this report to refer to the businesses of lyondellbasell industries nv and its consolidated subsidiaries we are one of the world’s top independent chemical companies based on revenues 

we participate globally across the petrochemical value chain and are an industry leader in many of our product lines our chemicals businesses consist primarily of large processing plants that convert large volumes of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon feedstocks into plastic resins and other chemicals our chemical products tend to be basic building blocks for other chemicals and plastics our plastic products are used in large volumes as well as smaller specialty applications our customers use our plastics and chemicals to manufacture a wide range of products that people use in their everyday lives including food packaging home furnishings automotive components paints and coatings our refining business consists of our houston refinery which processes crude oil into refined products such as gasoline diesel and jet fuel we also develop and license chemical and polyolefin process technologies and manufacture and sell polyolefin catalysts 

our financial performance is influenced by the supply and demand for our products the cost and availability of feedstocks and commodity products global and regional production capacity our operational efficiency and our ability to control costs we have a strong operational focus and as a producer of large volume commodities continuously strive to differentiate ourselves through safe reliable and lowcost operations in all our businesses we purchase large quantities of natural gas electricity and steam which we use as energy to fuel our facilities and purchase large quantities of natural gas liquids and crude oil derivatives which we use as feedstocks the relatively low cost of natural gasderived raw materials in the us versus the global cost of crude oilderived raw materials has had a significant positive influence on the profitability of our north american operations 

segments 

we manage our operations through six operating segments our reportable segments are 

• olefins and polyolefins—americas “op—americas” our op—americas segment produces and markets olefins and coproducts polyethylene and polypropylene 

• olefins and polyolefins—europe asia international “op—eai” our op—eai segment produces and markets olefins and coproducts polyethylene and polypropylene 

• intermediates and derivatives “id” our id segment produces and markets propylene oxide and its derivatives oxyfuels and related products and intermediate chemicals such as styrene monomer acetyls ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol 

• advanced polymer solutions “aps” our aps segment produces and markets compounding and solutions such as polypropylene compounds engineered plastics masterbatches colors and powders engineered composites and advanced polymers which includes catalloy and polybutene1 

• refining  our refining segment refines heavy highsulfur crude oil and other crude oils of varied types and sources available on the us gulf coast into refined products including gasoline and distillates 

• technology  our technology segment develops and licenses chemical and polyolefin process technologies and manufactures and sells polyolefin catalysts 

financial information about our business segments and geographical areas can be found in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements information about the locations where we produce our primary products can be 

found under “description of properties” no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues in 2020 2019 or 2018 

olefins and polyolefins segments generally 

we are one of the leading worldwide producers of olefins and polyethylene “pe” and we are the world’s second largest producer of polypropylene “pp” we manage our olefin and polyolefin business in two reportable segments op–americas and op — eai 

olefins  coproducts —ethylene is the most significant petrochemical in terms of worldwide production volume and is the key building block for pe and many other chemicals and plastics ethylene is produced by steam cracking hydrocarbons such as ethane propane butane and naphtha this production results in coproducts such as aromatics and other olefins including propylene and butadiene ethylene and its coproducts are fundamental to many parts of the economy including the production of consumer products packaging housing and automotive components and other durable and nondurable goods 

polyolefins —polyolefins such as pe and pp are polymers derived from olefins including ethylene and propylene polyolefins are the most widely used thermoplastics in the world and are found in applications and products that enhance the everyday quality of life our products are used in consumer automotive and industrial applications ranging from food and beverage packaging to housewares and construction materials 

polyethylene —we produce high density polyethylene “hdpe” low density polyethylene “ldpe” and linear low density polyethylene “lldpe” pe sales accounted for approximately 21 17 and 19 of our consolidated revenues in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

polypropylene —we produce pp homopolymers and copolymers pp sales accounted for approximately 16 14 and 15 of our consolidated revenues in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

olefins and polyolefins—americas segment 

overview 

our op—americas segment produces and markets olefins and coproducts polyethylene and polypropylene 

sales  marketing  customers 

most of the ethylene we produce is consumed internally as a raw material in the production of pe and other derivatives with the balance sold to third party customers primarily under multiyear contracts 

we use all the propylene we produce in the production of pp propylene oxide and other derivatives of those products we also purchase propylene from third parties in addition to purchases of propylene we purchase ethylene for resale when necessary to satisfy customer demand above our own production levels volumes of any of these products purchased for resale can vary significantly from period to period and are typically most significant during extended outages of our own production such as during planned maintenance however purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profits except to the extent that they replace our lowercost production 

most of the ethylene and propylene production from our channelview corpus christi and la porte texas facilities is shipped via a pipeline system which has connections to numerous us gulf coast consumers this pipeline system extends from corpus christi to mont belvieu texas in addition exchange agreements with other ethylene and coproducts producers allow access to customers who are not directly connected to this pipeline system some ethylene is shipped by railcar from our clinton iowa facility to our morris illinois facility and some is shipped directly to customers propylene from clinton and morris is generally shipped by marine vessel barge railcar or truck 

in 2020 we added a total of 785 thousand tons of olefins and 1170 thousand tons of pe capacity at our whollyowned and joint venture facilities in north america this capacity is based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint ventures’ total capacities our pp and pe production is typically sold through our sales organization to an extensive base of established customers and distributors servicing both the domestic and export markets either under annual contracts or on a spot basis we have sales offices in various locations in north america and our polyolefins are primarily transported in north america by railcar or truck export sales are primarily to customers in latin america with sales to asia expected to increase in the coming years as global supply and demand balances shift we also consume pp in our pp compounds business which is managed worldwide by our aps segment 

joint venture relationships 

in december 2020 we formed a 5050 joint venture in louisiana which provides us with capacity of approximately 770 thousand tons of ethylene and 445 thousand tons of low density and linearlow density pe production per year we operate the joint venture assets and market all the production on behalf of the joint venture 

we participate in a joint venture in mexico which provides us with capacity of approximately 290 thousand tons of pp production per year we do not hold a majority interest in or have operational control of this joint venture 

the capacities are based on our percentage ownership of the joint venture’s total capacity 

raw materials 

raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost to produce ethylene and its coproducts the primary raw materials used in our americas olefin facilities are natural gas liquids “ngls” and heavy liquids heavy liquids include crude oilbased naphtha and other refined products as well as condensate a very light crude oil resulting from natural gas production ngls include ethane propane and butane the use of heavy liquid raw materials results in the production of significant volumes of coproducts such as propylene butadiene and benzene as well as gasoline blending components while the use of ngls results in the production of a smaller volume of coproducts 

our ability to pass on raw material price increases to our customers is dependent on marketdriven demand for olefins and polyolefins sales prices for products sold in the spot market are determined by market forces our contract prices are influenced by product supply and demand conditions spot prices indices published in industry publications and in some instances cost recovery formulas 

we can manufacture olefins by utilizing a variety of feedstocks including heavy liquids and ngls technological advances for extracting shalebased oil and gas have led to an increased supply of ngls providing a cost advantage over heavy liquids particularly in the us a plant’s flexibility to consume a wide range of raw materials generally provides an advantage over plants that are restricted in their processing capabilities our americas facilities can process significant quantities of either heavy liquids or ngls we estimate that in the us we can produce up to approximately 90 of our total ethylene output using ngls changes in the raw material feedstock mix utilized in the production process will result in variances in production capacities among products we believe our raw material flexibility in the us is a key advantage in our production of ethylene and its coproducts 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to olefins and polyolefins competition is based on price and to a lesser extent on product quality product delivery reliability of supply product performance and customer service profitability is affected not only by supply and demand for olefins and polyolefins but also by raw material costs and price competition among producers which may intensify due to among other things the addition of new capacity in general demand is a function of economic growth including the regional dynamics that underlie global growth trends 

we compete in north america with other large marketers and producers including global chemical companies chemical divisions of large oil companies and regional marketers and producers 

based on published capacity data and including our proportionate share of joint ventures we believe as of december 31 2020 we were 

• the second largest producer of ethylene in north america with ethylene capacity of 62 million tons per year including our share of our louisianabased joint venture capacity 

• the third largest producer of pe in north america with 41 million tons per year including our share of our louisianabased joint venture capacity and 

• the largest producer of pp in north america with 19 million tons per year including our share of our mexican joint venture capacity and approximately 280 thousand tons of catalloy capacity reported within our advanced polymer solutions segment 

olefins and polyolefins—europe asia international segment 

overview 

our op — eai segment produces and markets olefins and coproducts polyethylene and polypropylene 

sales  marketing  customers 

our ethylene production is primarily consumed internally as a raw material in the production of polyolefins and we purchase additional ethylene as needed to meet our production needs our propylene production is used as a raw material in the production of pp and propylene oxide and derivatives of those products and we regularly purchase propylene from third parties because our internal needs exceed our internal production 

with respect to pp and pe our production is typically sold through our sales organization to an extensive base of established customers under annual contracts or on a spot basis and is also sold through distributors our polyolefins are primarily transported in europe by railcar or truck in 2020 we added a total of 550 thousand tons of olefins 400 thousand tons of pe and 310 thousand tons of pp at our whollyowned and joint venture facilities this capacity is based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint ventures’ total capacities 

our regional sales offices are in various locations including the netherlands hong kong china india australia and the united arab emirates we also operate through a worldwide network of local sales and representative offices in europe and asia our joint ventures described below typically manage their domestic sales and marketing efforts independently and we typically operate as their agent for all or a portion of their exports 

joint venture relationships 

on september 1 2020 we established and startedup a 5050 joint venture in china which provides us with capacity of 550 thousand tons of ethylene 400 thousand tons of linearlow density pe and 300 thousand tons of pp capacity the materials produced at the joint venture facility are expected to be sold in china 

we participate in several manufacturing joint ventures in saudi arabia china poland south korea thailand and the netherlands we do not hold majority interests in any of these joint ventures nor do we have operational control these ventures provide us with additional annual production capacity of approximately 15 million tons of pp approximately 12 million tons of olefins and approximately 820 thousand tons of pe these capacities are based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint ventures’ total capacities 

we generally license our polyolefin process technologies and supply catalysts to our joint ventures through our technology segment some of our joint ventures are able to source cost advantaged raw materials from their local shareholders 

raw materials 

raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost for the production of olefins and coproducts the primary raw material used in our european olefin facilities is naphtha however we also use advantaged ngls we have flexibility to vary the raw material mix and process conditions in our plants in order to maximize profitability as market prices for both feedstocks and products change the principal raw materials used in the production of polyolefins are propylene and ethylene in europe we have the capacity to produce approximately 50 of the propylene requirements for our european pp production and all of the ethylene requirements for our european pe production propylene and ethylene requirements that are not produced internally are generally acquired pursuant to longterm contracts with third party suppliers or via spot purchases 

our ability to pass through the increased cost of raw materials to customers is dependent on global market demand for olefins and polyolefins in general the pricing for purchases and sales of most products is determined by global market forces including the impacts of foreign exchange rates relative to the pricing of the underlying raw materials most of which are priced in us dollars there can be a lag between raw material price changes and contract product price changes that will cause volatility in our product margins 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to olefins and polyolefins competition is based on price product quality product delivery reliability of supply product performance and customer service we compete with regional and multinational chemical companies and divisions of large oil companies the petrochemical market has been affected by the price volatility of naphtha the primary feedstock for olefins in the region 

based on published capacity data and including our proportionate share of our joint ventures we believe as of december 31 2020 we were 

• the fifth largest producer of ethylene in europe with an ethylene capacity of 19 million tons per year 

• the largest producer of pe in europe with 22 million tons per year of capacity including our share of our joint ventures in poland and the netherlands and 

• the largest producer of pp in europe with 27 million tons per year of capacity including our share of our joint ventures in poland belgium and the netherlands approximately 265 thousand tons of catalloy capacity reported within our advanced polymer solutions segment 

intermediates and derivatives segment 

overview 

our id segment produces and markets propylene oxide “po” and its derivatives oxyfuels and related products and intermediate chemicals such as styrene monomer “sm” acetyls and ethylene oxides and derivatives 

po and derivatives— we produce po through two distinct technologies one of which yields tertiary butyl alcohol “tba” as the coproduct and the other of which yields sm as the coproduct the two technologies are mutually exclusive with dedicated assets for manufacturing either potba or posm po is an intermediate commodity chemical and is a precursor of polyols propylene glycol propylene glycol ethers and butanediol po and derivatives are used in a variety of durable and consumable items with key applications such as polyurethanes used for insulation automotivefurniture cushioning coatings surfactants synthetic resins and several other household usages 

oxyfuels and related products —we produce two distinct etherbased oxyfuels methyl tertiary butyl ether “mtbe” and ethyl tertiary butyl ether “etbe” these oxyfuels are produced by converting the tba coproduct of po into isobutylene and reacting with methanol or ethanol to produce either mtbe or etbe both are used as highoctane gasoline components that help gasoline burn cleaner and reduce automobile emissions other tba derivatives which we refer to as “c4 chemicals” are largely used to make synthetic rubber and other gasoline additives 

intermediate chemicals —we produce other commodity chemicals that utilize ethylene as a key component feedstock including sm acetyls and ethylene oxide derivatives sm is utilized in various applications such as plastics expandable polystyrene for packaging foam cups and containers insulation products and durables and engineering resins our acetyls products comprise methanol glacial acetic acid “gaa” and vinyl acetate monomer “vam” natural gas methane is the feedstock for methanol some of which is converted to gaa and a portion of the gaa is reacted with ethylene to create vam vam is an intermediate chemical used in fabric or wood treatments pigments coatings films and adhesives ethylene oxide is an intermediate chemical that is used to produce ethylene glycol glycol ethers and other derivatives ethylene oxide and its derivatives are used in the production of polyester antifreeze fluids solvents and other chemical products 

sales  marketing  customers 

we sell our po and derivatives through multiyear sales and processing agreements as well as spot sales some of our contract sales agreements have cost plus pricing terms po and derivatives are transported by barge marine vessel pipeline railcar and tank truck 

we sell our oxyfuels and related products under market and costbased sales agreements and in the spot market oxyfuels are transported by barge marine vessel and tank truck and are used as octane blending components worldwide outside of the us due to their blending characteristics and emission benefits c4 chemicals such as highpurity isobutylene are sold to producers of synthetic rubber and other chemical products primarily in the us and europe and are transported by railcar tank truck pipeline and marine shipments 

intermediate chemicals are shipped by barge marine vessel pipeline railcar and tank truck sm is sold globally into regions such as north america europe asia and south america export markets through spot sales and commercial contracts within acetyls methanol is consumed internally to make gaa used as a feedstock for oxyfuels and related products and also sold directly into the merchant commercial market gaa is converted with ethylene to produce vam which is sold worldwide under multiyear commercial contracts and on a spot basis 

sales of our po and derivatives oxyfuels and related products and intermediate chemicals are made by our marketing and sales personnel and also through distributors and independent agents in the americas europe the middle east africa and the asiapacific region 

joint venture relationships 

we have two po joint ventures with covestro ag one in the us and one in europe we operate four of the us po production facilities for the us po joint venture covestro’s interest represents ownership of an inkind portion of the po production of 680 thousand tons per year we take inkind the remaining po production and all coproduct production the parties’ rights in the joint venture are based on offtake volumes related to actual production of po as opposed to ownership percentages covestro also has the right to 50 of the po and sm production of our european po joint venture our proportional production capacity provided through this venture is approximately 160 thousand tons of po and approximately 340 thousand tons of sm we do not share marketing or product sales with covestro under either of these po joint ventures 

we also have a joint venture manufacturing relationship in china this venture provides us with additional production capacity of approximately 50 thousand tons of po this capacity is based on our operational share of the joint venture’s total capacity 

raw materials 

the cost of raw materials is the largest component of total production cost for po its coproducts and its derivatives propylene isobutane or mixed butane ethylene and benzene are the primary raw materials used in the production of po and its coproducts the market prices of these raw materials historically have been related to the price of crude oil ngls and natural gas as well as supply and demand for the raw materials 

in the us we obtain a large portion of our propylene benzene and ethylene raw materials needed for the production of po and its coproducts from our op — americas segment and to a lesser extent from third parties raw materials for the nonus production of po and its coproducts are obtained from our op — eai segment and from third parties we consume a significant portion of our internallyproduced po in the production of po derivatives 

the raw material requirements not sourced internally are purchased at marketbased prices from numerous suppliers in the us and europe with which we have established contractual relationships as well as in the spot market 

for the production of oxyfuels we purchase our ethanol feedstock requirements from third parties and obtain our methanol from both internal production and external sources carbon monoxide and methanol are the primary raw materials required for the production of gaa we source carbon monoxide from internal production which can be complemented by purchases from external sources as needed the methanol required for our downstream production of acetyls is internally sourced from our methanol plants in la porte texas and channelview texas natural gas is the primary raw material required for the production of methanol 

in addition to ethylene acetic acid is a primary raw material for the production of vam we obtain all our requirements for acetic acid and ethylene from our internal production historically we have used a large percentage of our acetic acid production to produce vam 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to product competition the market is influenced and based on a variety of factors including product quality price reliability of supply technical support customer service and potential substitute materials profitability is affected by the worldwide level of demand along with price competition which may intensify due to among other things new industry capacity and industry outages demand growth could be impacted by further development of alternative biobased methodologies our major worldwide competitors include other multinational chemical and refining companies as well as some regional marketers and producers 

based on published capacity data and including our proportionate share of our joint ventures we believe as of december 31 2020 we were 

• the second largest producer of po worldwide and 

• the second largest producer of oxyfuels worldwide 

advanced polymer solutions segment 

overview 

we formed the aps segment following our acquisition of a schulman inc “a schulman” in august 2018 our aps segment produces and markets compounding and solutions such as polypropylene compounds engineered plastics masterbatches colors and powders engineered composites and advanced polymers which include catalloy and polybutene1 polyolefin resins 

compounding and solutions —our polypropylene compounds are produced from blends of polyolefins and additives and are largely focused on automotive applications engineered plastics and engineered composites add value for more specialized highperformance applications used across a variety of industries masterbatches are compounds that provide differentiated properties when combined with commodity plastics used in packaging agriculture and durable goods applications specialty powders are largely used to mold toys industrial tanks and sporting goods such as kayaks performance colors provide powdered pelletized and liquid color concentrates for the plastics industry 

advanced polymers — catalloy and polybutene1 are unique polymers that can be used within the segment for downstream compounding or can be sold as raw materials to third parties catalloy is a line of differentiated propylenebased polymers that add value in packaging applications and construction materials such as the white membranes used in the commercial roofing market polybutene1 is used in both specialty piping and packaging applications 

sales  marketing  customers 

our products are sold through our global sales organization to a broad base of established customers and distributors under contract or on a spot basis these products are transported to our customers primarily by either truck or bulk rail the sales of compounding and solutions products accounted for approximately 12 of our consolidated revenues in each of 2020 and 2019 and 8 of consolidated revenue in 2018 

joint venture relationships 

we participate in several manufacturing joint ventures in saudi arabia indonesia thailand china and argentina we hold majority interests and have operational control of the joint ventures in argentina and indonesia we do not hold majority interests in any of the remaining joint ventures nor do we have operational control these ventures provide us with additional production capacity of approximately 90 thousand tons of compounding and solutions these capacities are based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint ventures’ total capacities 

raw materials 

the principal materials used in the production of our compounding and solutions products are polypropylene polyethylene polystyrene nylon and titanium dioxide raw materials required for the production of our compounding and solutions products are obtained from our wholly owned or joint venture facilities and from a number of major plastic resin producers or other suppliers at marketbased prices 

the principal raw materials used in the production of advanced polymers are ethylene propylene and butene1 ethylene and propylene requirements that are not produced internally and externallysupplied butene1 are acquired through longterm contracts with third party suppliers or via spot purchases 

our ability to pass through the increased cost of raw materials to customers is dependent on global market demand in general the pricing for purchases and sales of most products is determined by global market forces 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to product competition the market is influenced and based on a variety of factors including price product quality product delivery reliability of supply product performance and customer service we compete with regional and multinational marketers and producers of plastic resins and compounds 

based on published capacity data and including our proportionate share of our joint ventures we believe as of december 31 2020 we were the largest global producer of polypropylene compounds 

refining segment 

overview 

the primary products of our refining segment are refined products made from heavy highsulfur crude oil and other crude oils of varied types and sources available on the us gulf coast these refined products include gasoline and distillates 

sales  marketing  customers 

the houston refinery’s products are primarily sold in bulk to other refiners marketers distributors and wholesalers at marketrelated prices most of the houston refinery’s products are sold under contracts with a term of one year or less or are sold in the spot market the houston refinery’s products generally are transported to customers via pipelines and terminals owned and operated by other parties the sales of refined products accounted for approximately 16 22 and 21 of our total revenues in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

raw materials 

our houston refinery which is located on the houston ship channel in houston texas has a heavy highsulfur crude oil processing capacity of approximately 268 thousand barrels per day on a calendar day basis normal operating basis or approximately 292 thousand barrels per day on a stream day basis maximum achievable over a 24hour period the houston refinery is a full conversion refinery designed to refine heavy highsulfur crude oil this crude oil is more viscous and denser than traditional crude oil and contains higher concentrations of sulfur and heavy metals making it more difficult to refine into gasoline and other highvalue fuel products while heavy highsulfur crude oil has historically been less costly to purchase than light lowsulfur crude oil in recent years the price difference has narrowed us production is predominantly light sweet crude and much of the heavy crude has generally been imported from canada mexico and other global producers which has at times been subject to supply disruptions 

we purchase the crude oil used as a raw material for the houston refinery on the open market on a spot basis and under a number of supply agreements with regional producers generally with terms varying from one to two years 

industry dynamics  competition 

our refining competitors are major integrated oil companies refineries owned or controlled by foreign governments and independent domestic refiners based on published data as of january 2020 there were 135 operable crude oil refineries in the us and total us refinery capacity was approximately 19 million barrels per day during 2020 the houston refinery processed an average of approximately 223 thousand barrels per day of heavy crude oil 

our refining operations compete for the purchases of crude oil based on price and quality supply disruptions could impact the availability and pricing we compete in gasoline and distillate markets as a bulk supplier of fungible products satisfying industry and government specifications competition is based on price and location 

the markets for fuel products tend to be volatile as well as cyclical due to supply and demand fundamentals and changing crude oil and refined product prices crude oil prices are impacted by worldwide political events the economics of exploration and production and refined products demand prices and demand for fuel products are influenced by seasonal and shortterm factors such as weather and driving patterns as well as by longer term issues such as the economy environmental concerns energy conservation and alternative fuels industry fuel products supply is dependent on shortterm industry operating capabilities and on longterm refining capacity 

a crack spread is a benchmark indication of refining margins based on the processing of a specific type of crude oil into an assumed selection of major refined products the houston refinery generally tracks the maya 211 crack spread which represents the difference between the current month us gulf coast price of two barrels of maya crude oil as set by petróleos mexicanos “pemex” and one barrel each of us gulf coast reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending “rbob” gasoline and of us gulf coast ultra low sulfur diesel “ulsd” while these benchmark refining spreads are generally indicative of the level of profitability at the houston refinery and similarly configured refineries there are many other factors specific to each refinery and the industry in general such as the value of refinery byproducts which influence operating results refinery byproducts are products other than gasoline and distillates that represent about onethird of the total product volume and include coke sulfur and lighter materials such as ngls and crude olefins streams the cost of renewable identification numbers “rins” which are renewable fuel credits mandated by the us environmental protection agency the “epa” can also affect profitability 

technology segment 

overview 

our technology segment develops and licenses chemical and polyolefin process technologies and manufactures and sells polyolefin catalysts we market our process technologies and our polyolefin catalysts to external customers and also use them in our own manufacturing operations over the past three years approximately 20 to 25 of our catalyst sales were intercompany 

our polyolefin process licenses are structured to provide a standard core technology with individual customer needs met by adding customized modules that provide the required capabilities to produce the defined production grade slate and plant capacity in addition to the basic license agreement a range of services can also be provided including project assistance training assistance in starting up the plant and ongoing technical support after startup we may also offer marketing and sales services in addition licensees may continue to purchase polyolefin catalysts that are consumed in the production process generally under longterm catalyst supply agreements with us 

research and development 

our research and development “rd” activities are designed to improve our existing products and processes and discover and commercialize new materials catalysts and processes these activities focus on product and application development process development catalyst development and fundamental polyolefinfocused research 

in 2020 2019 and 2018 our rd expenditures were 113 million 111 million and 115 million respectively a portion of these expenses are related to technical support and customer service and are allocated to the other business segments in 2020 2019 and 2018 approximately 45 50 and 45 respectively of all rd costs were allocated to business segments other than technology 

general 

intellectual property 

we maintain an extensive patent portfolio and continue to file new patent applications in the us and other countries as of december 31 2020 we owned over 6000 patents and patent applications worldwide our patents and trade secrets cover our processes products and catalysts and are significant to our competitive position particularly with regard to po intermediate chemicals petrochemicals polymers and our process technologies while we believe that our intellectual property provides competitive advantages we do not regard our businesses as being materially dependent upon any single patent trade secret or trademark some of our production capacity operates under licenses from third parties 

environmental 

most of our operations are affected by national state regional and local environmental laws matters pertaining to the environment are discussed in part i item 1a risk factors  part i item 3 legal proceedings  part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation s and notes 2 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

we have made and intend to continue to make the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to environmental health and safety matters we incurred capital expenditures of 195 million in 2020 for health safety and environmental compliance purposes and improvement programs and estimate such expenditures to be approximately 260 million in 2021 and 250 million in 2022 

while capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance including compliance with potential legislation and potential regulation related to climate change cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe they will have a material effect on our competitive position 

while there can be no assurance that physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future we do not believe these risks are material in the near term

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 

risks related to our business and industry 

the cyclicality and volatility of the industries in which we participate may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 

our business operations are subject to the cyclical and volatile nature of the supplydemand balance in the chemical and refining industries our future operating results are expected to continue to be affected by this cyclicality and volatility the chemical and refining industries historically have experienced alternating periods of capacity shortages causing prices and profit margins to increase followed by periods of excess capacity resulting in oversupply declining capacity utilization rates and declining prices and profit margins 

in addition to changes in the supply and demand for products changes in energy prices and other worldwide economic conditions can cause volatility these factors result in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over business cycles 

new capacity additions around the world may lead to periods of oversupply and lower profitability the timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions are uncertain and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time as a consequence we are unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of future industry cycles or their effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

a sustained decrease in the price of crude oil may adversely impact the results of our operations primarily in north america 

energy costs generally follow price trends of crude oil and natural gas these price trends may be highly volatile and cyclical in the past raw material and energy costs have experienced significant fluctuations that adversely affected our business segments’ results of operations for example we have benefited from the favorable ratio of us crude oil prices to natural gas prices in the past if the price of crude oil remains lower relative to us natural gas prices or if the demand for natural gas and ngls increases this may have a negative impact on our results of operations 

costs and limitations on supply of raw materials and energy may result in increased operating expenses 

the costs of raw materials and energy represent a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to the significant competition we face and the commodity nature of many of our products we are not always able to pass on raw material and energy cost increases to our customers when we do have the ability to pass on the cost increases we are not always able to do so quickly enough to avoid adverse impacts on our results of operations 

cost increases for raw materials also may increase working capital needs which could reduce our liquidity and cash flow even if we increase our sales prices to reflect rising raw material and energy costs demand for products may decrease as customers reduce their consumption or use substitute products which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition producers in natural gas costadvantaged regions such as the middle east and north america benefit from the lower prices of natural gas and ngls competition from producers in these regions may cause us to reduce exports from europe and elsewhere any such reductions may increase competition for product sales within europe and other markets which can result in lower margins in those regions 

for some of our raw materials and utilities there are a limited number of suppliers and in some cases the supplies are specific to the particular geographic region in which a facility is located it is also common in the chemical and refining industries for a facility to have a sole dedicated source for its utilities such as steam electricity and gas having a sole or limited number of suppliers may limit our negotiating power particularly in the case of rising raw material costs any new supply agreements we enter into may not have terms as favorable as those contained in our current supply agreements 

additionally there is growing concern over the reliability of water sources including around the us gulf coast where several of our facilities are located the decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of population growth drought or regulation could negatively impact our operations including by impacting our ability to produce or transport our products 

if our raw material or utility supplies were disrupted our businesses may incur increased costs to procure alternative supplies or incur excessive downtime which would have a negative impact on plant operations disruptions of supplies may occur as a result of transportation issues resulting from natural disasters water levels and interruptions in marine water routes among other causes that can affect the operations of vessels barges rails trucks and pipeline traffic these risks are particularly prevalent in the us gulf coast area additionally increasing exports of ngls and crude oil from the us or greater restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could restrict the availability of our raw materials thereby increasing our costs 

with increased volatility in raw material costs our suppliers could impose more onerous terms on us resulting in shorter payment cycles and increasing our working capital requirements 

our ability to source raw materials may be adversely affected by political instability civil disturbances or other governmental actions 

we obtain a portion of our principal raw materials from sources in the middle east and central and south america that may be less politically stable than other areas in which we conduct business political instability civil disturbances and actions by governments in these areas are more likely to substantially increase the price and decrease the supply of raw materials necessary for our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

incidents of civil unrest including terrorist attacks and demonstrations that have been marked by violence have occurred in a number of countries in the middle east and south america some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest political instability and civil unrest could continue to spread in the region and involve other areas such unrest if it continues to spread or grow in intensity could lead to civil wars regional conflicts or regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to countries in which we conduct substantial business such as in the us europe or their respective trading partners 

our business is capital intensive and we rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and ongoing capital needs limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results 

we require significant capital to operate our current business and fund our growth strategy moreover interest payments dividends and the expansion of our current business or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital we believe that our cash from operations currently will be sufficient to meet these 

needs however if we need external financing our access to credit markets and pricing of our capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies and the state of the capital markets generally there can be no assurances that we would be able to incur indebtedness on terms we deem acceptable and it is possible that the cost of any financings could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities which could adversely affect our operating results 

we may use our 25 billion revolving credit facility which backs our commercial paper program to meet our cash needs to the extent available as of december 31 2020 we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the facility and 500 million net of discount outstanding under our commercial paper program leaving an unused and available credit capacity of 2020 million we may also meet our cash needs by selling receivables under our 900 million us receivables facility as of december 31 2020 subject to a borrowing base of eligible receivables we had availability of 757 million under this facility in the event of a default under our credit facility or any of our senior notes we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do any default under any of our credit arrangements could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate 

risks related to our operations 

our operations are subject to risks inherent in chemical and refining businesses and we could be subject to liabilities for which we are not fully insured or that are not otherwise mitigated 

we maintain property business interruption product general liability casualty and other types of insurance that we believe are appropriate for our business and operations as well as in line with industry practices however we are not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to our business including losses resulting from natural disasters wars or terrorist acts changes in insurance market conditions have caused and may in the future cause premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies to increase substantially and in some instances for certain insurance to become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured we might not be able to finance the amount of the uninsured liability on terms acceptable to us or at all and might be obligated to divert a significant portion of our cash flow from normal business operations 

our business including our results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected by safety or product liability issues 

failure to appropriately manage safety human health product liability and environmental risks associated with our products product life cycles and production processes could adversely impact employees communities stakeholders our reputation and our results of operations public perception of the risks associated with our products and production processes could impact product acceptance and influence the regulatory environment in which we operate while we have procedures and controls to manage safety risks issues could be created by events outside of our control including natural disasters severe weather events and acts of sabotage 

further because a part of our business involves licensing polyolefin process technology our licensees are exposed to similar risks involved in the manufacture and marketing of polyolefins hazardous incidents involving our licensees if they do result or are perceived to result from use of our technologies may harm our reputation threaten our relationships with other licensees andor lead to customer attrition and financial losses our policy of covering these risks through contractual limitations of liability and indemnities and through insurance may not always be effective as a result our financial condition and results of operation would be adversely affected and other companies with competing technologies may have the opportunity to secure a competitive advantage 

interruptions of operations at our facilities may result in increased liabilities or lower operating results 

we own and operate largescale facilities our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our various production facilities and the ability to complete construction and maintenance projects on schedule interruptions at our facilities may materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or our business as a whole during and after the period of such operational difficulties in recent years we have had to shut down plants on the us gulf coast including the temporary shutdown of a portion of our houston refinery as a result of various hurricanes striking texas and louisiana in addition because the houston refinery is our only refining operation an outage at the refinery could have a particularly negative impact on our operating results as we do not have the ability to increase refining production elsewhere 

although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions our operations are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and refining and the related storage and transportation of raw materials products and wastes these potential hazards include 

• pipeline leaks and ruptures 

• explosions 

• fires 

• severe weather and natural disasters 

• mechanical failure 

• unscheduled downtimes 

• supplier disruptions 

• labor shortages or other labor difficulties 

• transportation interruptions 

• remediation complications 

• increased restrictions on or the unavailability of water for use at our manufacturing sites or for the transport of our products or raw materials 

• chemical and oil spills 

• discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases 

• shipment of incorrect or offspecification product to customers 

• storage tank leaks 

• other environmental risks and 

• terrorist acts 

some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or personal injury and loss of life and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date negatively impacting project returns if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering procurement and construction of facilities could materially adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results for example higher costs arising from the delayed construction of our worldscale potba plant in houston due to covid19 more extensive civil construction and unexpected tariffs on materials are expected to add approximately 40 to 50 to our original cost estimate for the project impacting our projected rate of return on the project delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to contract with our customers and supply certain products we produce such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors many of which are beyond our control including 

• denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals andor permits 

• unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor 

• disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials 

• adverse weather conditions natural disasters or other events such as equipment malfunctions explosions fires or spills affecting our facilities or those of vendors or suppliers 

• shortages of sufficiently skilled labor or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages and 

• nonperformance by or disputes with vendors suppliers contractors or subcontractors 

any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects if we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs or if market conditions change it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

shared control or lack of control of joint ventures may delay decisions or actions regarding our joint ventures 

a portion of our operations are conducted through joint ventures where control may be exercised by or shared with unaffiliated third parties we cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners including any nonperformance default or bankruptcy of joint venture partners the joint ventures that we do not control may also lack financial reporting systems to provide adequate and timely information for our reporting purposes 

our joint venture partners may have different interests or goals than we do and may take actions contrary to our requests policies or objectives differences in views among the joint venture participants also may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major matters potentially adversely affecting the business and operations of the joint ventures and in turn our business and operations we may develop a dispute with any of our partners over decisions affecting the venture that may result in litigation arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution if a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interest it could harm our brand business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be required to record material charges against our earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets 

we may be required to reduce production or idle facilities for extended periods of time or exit certain businesses as a result of the cyclical nature of our industry specifically oversupplies of or lack of demand for particular products or high raw material prices may cause us to reduce production we may choose to reduce production at certain facilities because we have offtake arrangements at other facilities which make any reductions or idling unavailable at those facilities any decision to permanently close facilities or exit a business would likely result in impairment and other charges to earnings for example in the third quarter of 2020 our refining segment recognized a noncash impairment charge of 582 million related to our houston refinery driven by the expectation of a prolonged reduction in travel and associated transportation fuels consumption resulting from the pandemic which created an oversupply in global fuel markets that will pressure refining profitability for an extended period of time 

temporary outages at our facilities can last for several quarters and sometimes longer these outages could cause us to incur significant costs including the expenses of maintaining and restarting these facilities in addition we have significant obligations under takeorpay agreements even though we may reduce production at facilities we may be required to continue to purchase or pay for utilities or raw materials under these arrangements 

integration of acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions in order to enhance our business acquisitions involve numerous risks including meeting our standards for compliance problems combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs and liabilities diversion of management’s attention from our core businesses and potential loss of key employees 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to integrate successfully any businesses products technologies or personnel that we might acquire the integration of businesses that we may acquire is likely to be a complex timeconsuming and expensive process and we may not realize the anticipated revenues synergies or other benefits associated with our acquisitions if we do not manage and operate the acquired business up to our expectations if we are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems operating procedures financial controls and human resources practices our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

risks related to the global economy and multinational operations 

economic disruptions and downturns in general and particularly continued global economic uncertainty or economic turmoil in emerging markets could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

our results of operations can be materially affected by adverse conditions in the financial markets and depressed economic conditions generally economic downturns in the businesses and geographic areas in which we sell our products could substantially reduce demand for our products and result in decreased sales volumes and increased credit risk recessionary environments adversely affect our business because demand for our products is reduced particularly from our customers in industrial markets generally and the automotive and housing industries specifically and may result in higher costs of capital a significant portion of our revenues and earnings are derived from our business in europe in addition most of our european transactions and assets including cash reserves and receivables are denominated in euros 

we also derive significant revenues from our business in emerging markets particularly the emerging markets in asia and south america any broadbased downturn in these emerging markets or in a key market such as china could require us to reduce export volumes into these markets and could also require us to divert product sales to less profitable markets any of these conditions could ultimately harm our overall business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we sell products in highly competitive global markets and face significant price pressures 

we sell our products in highly competitive global markets due to the commodity nature of many of our products competition in these markets is based primarily on price and to a lesser extent on product performance product quality product deliverability reliability of supply and customer service often we are not able to protect our market position for these products by product differentiation and may not be able to pass on cost increases to our customers due to the significant competition in our business 

in addition we face increased competition from companies that may have greater financial resources and different cost structures or strategic goals than us these include large integrated oil companies some of which also have chemical businesses governmentowned businesses and companies that receive subsidies or other government incentives to produce certain products in a specified geographic region continuing competition from these companies especially in our olefin and refining businesses could limit our ability to increase product sales prices in 

response to raw material and other cost increases or could cause us to reduce product sales prices to compete effectively which would reduce our profitability competitors with different cost structures or strategic goals than we have may be able to invest significant capital into their businesses including expenditures for research and development in addition specialty products we produce may become commoditized over time increased competition could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 

we operate internationally and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations exchange controls political risks and other risks relating to international operations 

we operate internationally and are subject to the risks of doing business on a global level these risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates economic instability and disruptions restrictions on the transfer of funds and the imposition of trade restrictions or duties and tariffs and complex regulations concerning privacy and data security additional risks from our multinational business include transportation delays and interruptions war terrorist activities epidemics pandemics political instability import and export controls sanctions changes in governmental policies labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments 

we generate revenues from export sales and operations that may be denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency exchange rates between these currencies and functional currencies in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future it is possible that fluctuations in exchange rates will result in reduced operating results additionally we operate with the objective of having our worldwide cash available in the locations where it is needed including the united kingdom for our parent company’s significant cash obligations as a result of dividend payments it is possible that we may not always be able to provide cash to other jurisdictions when needed or that such transfers of cash could be subject to additional taxes including withholding taxes 

our operating results could be negatively affected by the laws rules and regulations as well as political environments in the jurisdictions in which we operate there could be reduced demand for our products decreases in the prices at which we can sell our products and disruptions of production or other operations trade protection measures such as quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures or antidumping duties imposed in the countries in which we operate could negatively impact our business additionally there may be substantial capital and other costs to comply with regulations andor increased security costs or insurance premiums any of which could reduce our operating results 

we obtain a portion of our principal raw materials from international sources that are subject to these same risks our compliance with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject could be challenged furthermore these laws may be modified the result of which may be to prevent or limit subsidiaries from transferring cash to us 

furthermore we are subject to certain existing and may be subject to possible future laws that limit or may limit our activities while some of our competitors may not be subject to such laws which may adversely affect our competitiveness 

changes in tax laws and regulations could affect our tax rate and our results of operations 

we are a tax resident in the united kingdom and are subject to the united kingdom corporate income tax system lyondellbasell industries nv has little or no taxable income of its own because as a holding company it does not conduct any operations through our subsidiaries we have substantial operations worldwide taxes are primarily paid on the earnings generated in various jurisdictions where our subsidiaries operate including the us the netherlands germany france and italy 

there continues to be increased attention to the tax practices of multinational companies including the european union’s state aid investigations proposals by the organization for economic cooperation and development with respect to base erosion and profit shifting and european union tax directives and their implementation management does not believe that recent changes in income tax laws will have a material impact on our business 

financial condition or results of operations although new or proposed changes to tax laws could affect our tax liabilities in the future 

risks related to health safety and the environment 

we cannot predict with certainty the extent of future costs under environmental health and safety and other laws and regulations and cannot guarantee they will not be material 

we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture handle or own in addition because our products are components of a variety of other enduse products we along with other members of the chemical industry are subject to potential claims related to those enduse products any substantial increase in the success of these types of claims could negatively affect our operating results 

we are subject to extensive national regional state and local environmental laws regulations directives rules and ordinances concerning 

• emissions to the air 

• discharges onto land or surface waters or into groundwater and 

• the generation handling storage transportation treatment disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials 

many of these laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations in addition some of these laws and regulations require us to meet specific financial responsibility requirements any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

although we have compliance programs and other processes intended to ensure compliance with all such regulations we are subject to the risk that our compliance with such regulations could be challenged noncompliance with certain of these regulations could result in the incurrence of additional costs penalties or assessments that could be material 

our industry is subject to extensive government regulation and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures 

compliance with regulatory requirements will result in higher operating costs such as regulatory requirements relating to emissions the security of our facilities and the transportation export or registration of our products we generally expect that regulatory controls worldwide will become increasingly more demanding but cannot accurately predict future developments 

increasingly strict environmental laws and inspection and enforcement policies could affect the handling manufacture use emission or disposal of products other materials or hazardous and nonhazardous waste stricter environmental safety and health laws regulations and enforcement policies could result in increased operating costs or capital expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations additionally we are required to have permits for our businesses and are subject to licensing regulations these permits and licenses are subject to renewal modification and in some circumstances revocation further the permits and licenses are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

we may incur substantial costs to comply with climate change legislation and related regulatory initiatives 

there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated international national and state laws focusing on greenhouse gas “ghg” reduction these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future laws and regulations in this field continue to evolve and while they are likely to be increasingly widespread and stringent at this stage it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation under the 2015 paris agreement parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change agreed to undertake ambitious efforts to reduce ghg emissions and strengthen adaptation to the effects of climate change in february 2021 the us recommitted to the agreement after having withdrawn in august 2017 other regions in which we operate including in particular the european union are preparing national legislation and protection plans to implement their emission reduction commitments under the agreement in december 2020 european union leadership agreed to cut ghg emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030 a step toward achieving the european union’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 these actions could result in increased cost of purchased energy and increased costs of compliance for impacted locations 

our operations in europe participate in the european union emissions trading system “ets” and we purchase annual emission allowances to meet our obligations in light of changes resulting from the commencement of ets phase iv in 2021 we expect to incur additional costs in relation to future carbon or ghg emission trading schemes 

in the us the epa promulgated federal ghg regulations under the clean air act affecting certain sources the epa issued mandatory ghg reporting requirements requirements to obtain ghg permits for certain industrial plants and ghg performance standards for some facilities although the epa recently scaled back certain ghg requirements addressing climate change is a stated priority of president biden and as such additional regulations and legislation are likely to be forthcoming at the us federal or state level that could result in increased operating costs for compliance or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances additionally demand for the products we produce may be reduced 

compliance with these regulations may result in increased permitting necessary for the operation of our business or for any of our growth plans difficulties in obtaining such permits could have an adverse effect on our future growth therefore any future potential regulations and legislation could result in additional operating restrictions or delays in implementing growth projects or other capital investments and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

legislation and regulatory initiatives could lead to a decrease in demand for our products 

new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health safety and the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products initiatives by governments and private interest groups will potentially require increased toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us for example in the united states the national toxicology program “ntp” is a federal interagency program that seeks to identify and select for study chemicals and other substances to evaluate potential human health hazards in the european union the regulation on registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals “reach” is regulation designed to identify the intrinsic properties of chemical substances assess hazards and risks of the substances and identify and implement the risk management measures to protect humans and the environment 

assessments under ntp reach or similar programs or regulations in other jurisdictions may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals we use or produce and may result in additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of those chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

the physical impacts of climate change can negatively impact our facilities and operations 

potential physical impacts of climate change include increased frequency and severity of hurricanes and floods as well as drought conditions and global sea level rise although we have preparedness plans in place designed to minimize impacts and enhance safety should an event occur it could have the potential to disrupt our supply chain and operations a number of our facilities are located on the gulf coast which has been impacted by hurricanes that have required us to temporarily shut down operations at those sites in addition our sites rely on rivers for transportation that may experience restrictions in times of drought or other unseasonal weather variation 

increased regulation or deselection of plastic could lead to a decrease in demand growth for some of our products 

there is a growing concern with the accumulation of plastic including microplastics and other packaging waste in the environment additionally plastics have recently faced increased public backlash and scrutiny policy measures to address this concern are being discussed or implemented by governments at all levels in 2019 the international treaty governing transboundary shipments of waste the basel convention was amended to clarify its applicability to plastic waste the european commission has been undertaking a series of actions under its strategy for plastics in a circular economy including adoption of the single use plastics directive in 2019 which introduced policy measures for single use plastics including bans product design requirements extended producer responsibility obligations and labeling requirements member states are required to transpose these measures into national law by july 2021 in addition a host of singleuse plastic bans and taxes have been passed by countries around the world and counties and municipalities throughout the us increased regulation of or prohibition on the use of certain plastic products could increase the costs incurred by our customers to use such products or otherwise limit the use of these products and could lead to a decrease in demand for pe pp and other products we make such a decrease in demand could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

general risk factors 

the novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic could continue to materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in early 2020 the covid19 pandemic spread to countries worldwide and resulted in governments and other authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the disease such as travel bans and restrictions social distancing quarantines shelterinplace orders and business shutdowns among others these measures caused significant economic disruption and adversely impacted the global economy leading to reduced consumer spending and volatility in the global financial and commodities markets many of our facilities and employees are located in areas impacted by the virus as a result of these measures and the general economic disruption we experienced a decline in our financial results primarily in the second and third quarters of 2020 particularly in our advanced polymer solutions and refining segments a return to more ordinary course of economic activity is dependent on the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic including the severity and transmission rate of the virus the extent and effectiveness of containment efforts including the spread of virus variants the availability of vaccines and future policy decisions made by governments across the globe as they react to evolving local and global conditions 

we continue to work with our stakeholders including customers employees suppliers business partners and local communities to attempt to mitigate the impact of the global pandemic on our business including by implementing policies and procedures to promote the safety of our employees proactively reducing costs intended to allow us to protect against further risk and investing in initiatives to support our longterm growth while also focusing on maintaining liquidity however we cannot assure that these mitigation efforts will continue to be effective or successful an extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the covid19 pandemic could have a material negative impact on our business results of operations access to sources of liquidity and financial condition to the extent that the covid19 pandemic adversely impacts our business results of operations liquidity or financial condition it may also have the effect of increasing many of the other risks described in “risk factors” set forth in this annual report on form 10k 

increased it and cybersecurity threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks data products facilities and services 

increased global information cybersecurity threats and more sophisticated targeted computer crime pose a risk to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data operations and infrastructure while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including security measures employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our employees systems networks products facilities and services remain potentially vulnerable to sophisticated espionage or cyberassault depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations 

many of our businesses depend on our intellectual property our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and our inability to do so could reduce our ability to maintain our competitiveness and margins 

we have a significant worldwide patent portfolio of issued and pending patents these patents and patent applications together with proprietary technical knowhow are significant to our competitive position particularly with regard to po intermediate chemicals polyolefins licensing and catalysts we rely on the patent copyright and trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing we operate plants sell catalysts and products participate in joint ventures and license our process technology in many foreign jurisdictions including those having heightened risks for intellectual property in some of these instances we must disclose at least a portion of our technology to third parties or regulatory bodies in these cases we rely primarily on contracts and trade secret laws to protect the associated trade secrets however we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without authorization proceedings to protect these rights could be costly and we may not prevail 

the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes apparatuses technology trade secrets or proprietary knowhow could result in significantly lower revenues reduced profit margins and cash flows andor loss of market share we also may be subject to claims that our technology patents or other intellectual property infringes on a third party’s intellectual property rights unfavorable resolution of these claims could result in restrictions on our ability to deliver the related service or in a settlement that could be material to us 

adverse results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us 

we are subject to and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty irrespective of its merits litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expenditure and diversion of management attention we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations should we fail to prevail in certain matters 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may adversely affect the valuation of pension obligations the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rates used to measure pension obligations the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets may result in corresponding increases and decreases in the value of plan assets particularly equity securities or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets any changes in key actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate or mortality rate would impact the valuation of pension obligations affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years 

nearly all of our current pension plans have projected benefit obligations that exceed the fair value of the plan assets as of december 31 2020 the aggregate deficit was 1482 million any declines in the fair values of the pension plans’ assets could require additional payments by us in order to maintain specified funding levels 

our pension plans are subject to legislative and regulatory requirements of applicable jurisdictions which could include under certain circumstances local governmental authority to terminate the plan

environmental matters 

from time to time we and our joint ventures receive notices or inquiries from government entities regarding alleged violations of environmental laws and regulations pertaining to among other things the disposal emission and storage of chemical and petroleum substances including hazardous wastes us securities and exchange commission rules require disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and the proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that we reasonably believe could exceed 300000 the matters below are disclosed solely pursuant to that requirement and we do not believe that any of these proceeding will have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

in march 2018 the cologne germany local court issued a regulatory fine notice of €1800000 arising from a pipeline leak near our wesseling germany facility we expect the cologne prosecutor to issue a corresponding payment request which will resolve the matter 

the us environmental protection agency epa has been conducting an enforcement initiative regarding flare emissions at petrochemical plants in july 2014 we received a clean air act section 114 information request regarding flares at four us facilities and entered into discussions with epa and the department of justice doj in december 2020 we reached a settlement agreement with epa and doj to resolve claims related to alleged improper operation and maintenance of flares at the four facilities the company has agreed to pay a penalty of 4100000 and make investments in equipment at the facilities the complaint and consent decree are expected to be filed in the us district court for the southern district of texas 

in february 2020 the state of texas filed suit against houston refining lp a subsidiary of lyondellbasell in travis county district court seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief for violations of the texas clean air act related to several emission events in july 2020 harris county texas petitioned to intervene in the lawsuit and the state added additional claims to its petition relating to selfreported deviations of houston refinings air operating permit we reasonably believe resolution of this matter could result in payment of a penalty in excess of 300000

overview 

during 2020 we demonstrated financial and operational resilience against the challenging backdrop of a global pandemic the associated recession volatile oil prices and significant capacity additions in our industry 

early in 2020 as the virus became more widespread our leadership team established three principles to guide our actions in the short term these were to i protect our employees both from the virus in the workplace and also from widespread layoffs ii prioritize cash flow and keep our commitments to our shareholders and iii take action to strengthen the company for the future 

our manufacturing operations have been designated as an essential industry to support society’s needs during the pandemic in the majority of the regions in which we operate our performance was supported by consumerdriven demand for many of our products and the recovery in demand for durable goods during the second half of the year our refining and oxyfuels  related products businesses suffered from the unprecedented decline in demand for transportation fuels that began during march 2020 due to the pandemic during the year we advanced our growth agenda through the formation of joint ventures in china and on the us gulf coast 

our strengths in operational excellence cost management and capital discipline served us well as we quickly adapted to dynamic conditions by minimizing working capital and bolstering liquidity by rapidly accessing capital markets and efficiently generating cash we honored commitments to maintain an investment grade credit rating and continued to fund dividends and capital investments with cash from operations 

significant items that affected results in 2020 relative to 2019 include 

• olefins and polyolefins—americas “op—americas” and olefins and polyolefins—europe asia international “op—eai” segment results declined primarily due to lower olefin and polyolefins margins 

• intermediates and derivatives “id” segment results declined due to margin decreases primarily driven by our intermediate chemicals and oxyfuels and related products businesses and 

• refining segment results declined due to lower refining margins and a 582 million noncash impairment charge which was recognized during the third quarter of 2020 

other noteworthy items include the following 

• launched production at our us gulf coast highdensity polyethylene plant using lyondellbasells nextgeneration hyperzone technology during the first quarter of 2020 

• in april 2020 issued 2000 million of guaranteed notes to bolster liquidity net proceeds from the sale of the notes totaled 1974 million 

• in april 2020 repaid 500 million outstanding under our senior revolving credit facility and 500 million outstanding under our us receivables facility which were borrowed in march 2020 

• in august 2020 invested 472 million in our new 50 percent owned joint venture polyolefin complex in china with liaoning bora enterprise group using our polyolefin technologies 

• in october 2020 issued 3900 million of guaranteed notes to be used to repay certain outstanding borrowings and fund a portion of the louisiana integrated polyethylene jv llc “louisiana joint venture” purchase net proceeds from the sale of the notes totaled 3848 million 

• in the fourth quarter of 2020 repaid 500 million outstanding under our term loan due 2022 and all amounts outstanding on our senior notes due 2021 and guaranteed notes due 2022 

• in december 2020 invested 2 billion to purchase a 50 percent interest in the newly formed louisiana joint venture with sasol chemicals usa llc 

• in january 2021 signed an agreement to form a 50 percent owned joint venture with the china petroleum  chemical corporation “sinopec” which will construct a new po and sm unit in china and 

• in january 2021 repaid an additional 500 million outstanding under our term loan due 2022 

results of operations for the periods discussed are presented in the table below 



results of operations 

revenues —revenues decreased 6974 million or 20 in 2020 compared to 2019 average sales prices in 2020 were lower for most of our products as sales prices generally correlate with crude oil prices which decreased relative to 2019 these lower prices led to a 19 decrease in revenue in 2020 lower sales volumes resulted in a revenue decrease of 2 relative to 2019 favorable foreign exchange impacts resulted in a revenue increase of 1 during 2020 

cost of sales —cost of sales decreased 4942 million or 17 in 2020 compared to 2019 this decrease primarily related to lower feedstock and energy costs costs for crude oil heavy liquid feedstocks and natural gas liquids “ngls” and other feedstocks were lower in 2020 relative to 2019 this decrease corresponds with the decrease in revenues as discussed above 

fluctuations in our cost of sales are generally driven by changes in feedstock and energy costs feedstock and energy related costs generally represent approximately 70 to 80 of cost of sales other variable costs account for approximately 10 of cost of sales on an annual basis and fixed operating costs consisting primarily of expenses associated with employee compensation depreciation and amortization and maintenance range from approximately 10 to 20 in each annual period 

impairment of longlived assets —in the third quarter of 2020 our refining segment recognized a noncash impairment charge of 582 million related to our houston refinery driven by the expectation of a prolonged reduction of travel and associated transportation fuels consumption resulting from the pandemic which created an oversupply in global fuel markets that will pressure refining profitability for an extended period of time 

sga expense —selling general and administrative “sga” expense decreased 59 million or 5 in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower integration costs related to the acquisition of a schulman integration activities related to our acquisition of a schulman were substantially completed by the third quarter of 2020 

operating income —operating income decreased by 2557 million or 62 in 2020 compared to 2019 operating income includes the effect of the noncash longlived asset impairment charge in our refining segment as noted above 

in 2020 operating income declined across all of our segments by 784 million 748 million 607 million 261 million 87 million and 64 million for our refining id op—americas op—eai technology and aps segments respectively as compared to 2019 

interest expense —interest expense increased 179 million or 52 in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in longterm debt and the recognition of 69 million in charges related to the redemption of certain longterm notes in 2020 see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

income taxes— our effective income tax rates of 31 in 2020 and 160 in 2019 resulted in a tax benefit of 43 million and a tax provision of 648 million respectively 

our effective income tax rate fluctuates based on among other factors changes in pretax income in countries with varying statutory tax rates changes in valuation allowances changes in foreign exchange gainslosses the amount of exempt income changes in unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions and changes in tax laws we continue to maintain valuation allowances in various jurisdictions totaling 132 million as of 2020 which could impact our effective income tax rate in the future 

on march 27 2020 the us enacted the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act also known as the “cares act” which contains numerous income tax provisions and other stimulus measures in 2020 we recorded an overall tax benefit in relation to the cares act of approximately 300 million which reflects the impact of our expected 2020 us tax losses which we intend to carryback to tax years with a higher tax rate and a cash refund of approximately 900 million for additional information see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

the 2020 effective income tax rate of 31 which is lower than the us statutory tax rate of 21 was favorably impacted by tax law changes including the cares act 215 coupled with exempt income 104 partially offset by changes in unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions 70 

the 2019 effective income tax rate of 16 which was lower than the us statutory tax rate of 21 was favorably impacted by exempt income 45 a tax benefit related to a patent box ruling 16 a loss on the liquidation of an entity 13 and changes in unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions 10 these favorable items were partially offset by the effects of earnings in various countries notably in europe with higher statutory tax rates 16 and us state and local income taxes 07 

during 2019 we recognized a 113 million noncash benefit to our effective tax rate primarily as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitations this amount consists of the recognition of 100 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits and the release of 13 million of previously accrued interest 

comprehensive income— we had comprehensive income of 1268 million in 2020 and 2976 million in 2019 comprehensive income decreased by 1708 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower net income and net unfavorable impacts of financial derivative instruments primarily driven by periodic changes in benchmark interest rates these decreases were partially offset by net favorable impacts of unrealized changes in foreign currency translation adjustments and improved changes in defined pension and other postretirement benefits 

the predominant functional currency for our operations outside of the us is the euro relative to the us dollar the value of the euro increased during 2020 resulting in net gains as reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income the gains related to unrealized changes in foreign currency translation impacts were partially offset by pretax losses of 166 million in 2020 which represent the effective portion of our net investment hedges 

in 2020 the cumulative aftertax effect of our derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was a net loss of 226 million the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar in 2020 and periodic changes in benchmark interest rates resulted in a pretax loss of 129 million related to our crosscurrency swaps a 170 million pretax gain related to our crosscurrency swaps was reclassified to other income net in 2020 in 2020 a pretax loss of 347 million related to forwardstarting interest rate swaps was driven by changes in benchmark interest rates the remaining change relates to our commodity cash flow hedges 

we recognized defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans pretax losses of 51 million and 361 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively primarily due to the fluctuations in the discount rate assumption used in determining the net benefit liabilities for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding net actuarial losses 

segment analysis 

we use earnings before interest income taxes and depreciation and amortization “ebitda” as our measure of profitability for segment reporting purposes this measure of segment operating results is used by our chief operating decision maker to assess the performance of and allocate resources to our operating segments intersegment eliminations and items that are not directly related or allocated to business operations such as foreign exchange gains losses and components of pension and other postretirement benefit costs other than service cost are included in “other” for additional information related to our operating segments as well as a reconciliation of ebitda to its nearest generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” measure income from continuing operations before income taxes see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements 

our continuing operations are managed through six reportable segments op—americas op—eai id aps refining and technology the following tables reflect selected financial information for our reportable segments 





olefins and polyolefins–americas segment 

overview —ebitda declined in 2020 relative to 2019 primarily due to lower margins in challenging market conditions arising from a low oil price environment and the impact of covid19 

in calculating the impact of margin and volume on ebitda consistent with industry practice management offsets revenues and volumes related to ethylene coproducts against the cost to produce ethylene volume and price impacts of ethylene coproducts are reported in margin 

ethylene raw materials —ethylene and its coproducts are produced from two major raw material groups 

• ngls principally ethane and propane the prices of which are generally affected by natural gas prices and 

• crude oilbased liquids “liquids” or “heavy liquids” including naphtha condensates and gas oils the prices of which are generally related to crude oil prices 

we have flexibility to vary the raw material mix and process conditions in our us olefins plants in order to maximize profitability as market prices fluctuate for both feedstocks and products although prices of crudebased liquids and natural gas liquids are generally related to crude oil and natural gas prices during specific periods the relationships among these materials and benchmarks may vary significantly in 2020 and 2019 approximately 5560 of the raw materials used in our north american crackers was ethane 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the op—americas segment including income from equity investments which is a component of ebitda 



revenues —revenues decreased by 1160 million or 14 in 2020 compared to 2019 average sales prices were lower in 2020 compared to 2019 due to the lower oil price environment and other impacts of covid19 these lower sales prices were responsible for a revenue decrease of 18 in 2020 volume increases resulted in a revenue increase of 4 in 2020 primarily due to high demand for polyethylene 

ebitda —ebitda decreased by 492 million or 21 in 2020 compared to 2019 lower olefin results led to a 10 decline in ebitda in 2020 primarily due to lower coproduct prices outpacing reduced feedstock costs polyethylene results declined resulting in a 5 decrease in ebitda in 2020 this decrease was driven by a 77 per ton reduction in price spreads over ethylene in 2020 polypropylene results led to a 4 decrease in ebitda in 2020 largely due to a decline in margins attributed to lower price spreads over propylene of 84 per ton in 2020 

olefins and polyolefins–europe asia international segment 

overview — ebitda decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 mainly as a result of lower olefin and polypropylene margins 

in calculating the impact of margin and volume on ebitda consistent with industry practice management offsets revenues and volumes related to ethylene coproducts against the cost to produce ethylene volume and price impacts of ethylene coproducts are reported in margin 

ethylene raw materials —in europe heavy liquids are the primary raw materials for our ethylene production in 2020 and 2019 we continued to benefit from sourcing advantaged ngls as market opportunities arose 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the op—eai segment including income from equity investments which is a component of ebitda 



revenues —revenues in 2020 decreased by 1137 million or 12 compared to 2019 average sales prices in 2020 were lower across most products as sales prices generally correlate with crude oil prices which on average decreased compared to 2019 these lower average sales prices were responsible for revenue decreases of 19 in 2020 volume improvements resulted in revenue increases of 6 in 2020 driven by strong polymer demand in europe and asia foreign exchange impacts which on average were favorable resulted in a revenue increase of 1 in 2020 

ebitda —ebitda decreased by 236 million or 22 in 2020 compared to 2019 lower olefins results led to a 13 decrease in ebitda in 2020 primarily driven by lower margins driven by a decline in ethylene prices outpacing lower feedstock costs polypropylene results led to a 10 decrease in ebitda in 2020 largely due to a decline in margins attributed to a reduction in price spreads over propylene by 29 per ton in 2020 favorable foreign exchange impacts resulted in an ebitda benefit of 2 planned maintenance in 2021 is expected to reduce ebitda by approximately 25 million 

intermediates and derivatives segment 

overview— ebitda for our id segment was lower in 2020 compared to 2019 largely driven by margin erosion due to the impacts of covid19 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the id segment including income from equity investments which is a component of ebitda 



revenues —revenues decreased by 1565 million or 20 in 2020 compared to 2019 lower average sales prices in 2020 for most products which reflect the impacts of lower feedstock and energy costs were responsible for a revenue decrease of 21 favorable foreign exchange impacts increased revenue by 1 in 2020 

ebitda —ebitda decreased 724 million or 46 in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by lower margins across most businesses oxyfuels and related products results declined resulting in a 30 decrease in ebitda in 2020 the decline was a result of a significant decrease in margins driven by lower gasoline prices and octane premiums declines in intermediate chemicals results led to an ebitda decrease of 11 in 2020 this decrease was a result of lower margins as demand weakened due to the impacts of covid19 and additional market supply derived from competitors in 2020 planned maintenance in 2021 is expected to reduce ebitda by approximately 145 million 

advanced polymer solutions segment 

overview— ebitda for our aps segment decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower compounding and solutions volumes 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the aps segment 



revenues —revenues decreased in 2020 by 937 million or 19 compared to 2019 sales volumes declined in 2020 stemming from lower market demand for compounding and solutions including lower automotive and appliance demand which led to a 15 decrease in revenue in 2020 lower average sales prices resulted in a 6 decrease in revenue favorable foreign exchange impacts increased revenue by 2 in 2020 

ebitda —ebitda decreased in 2020 by 46 million or 11 compared to 2019 compounding and solutions results declined resulting in a 18 decrease of ebitda this decrease was attributable to lower volumes driven by reduced demand for our products utilized in the automotive and appliance sectors which were impacted by covid19 advanced polymers results reduced ebitda by 8 largely due to lower margins driven by reduced construction market demand this decrease was offset by an increase in ebitda of approximately 80 million or 19 in 2020 due to lower integration costs related to the acquisition of a schulman integration activities related to our 2018 acquisition of a schulman inc were substantially completed by the third quarter of 2020 

refining segment 

overview —ebitda for our refining segment decreased in 2020 relative to 2019 primarily due to lower margins and a noncash impairment charge of 582 million recognized during the third quarter of 2020 

the following table sets forth selected financial information and heavy crude oil processing rates for the refining segment and the us refining market margins for the applicable periods “brent” is a light sweet crude oil and is one of the main benchmark prices for purchases of oil worldwide “maya” is a heavy sour crude oil grade produced in mexico that is a relevant benchmark for heavy sour crude oils in the us gulf coast market references to industry benchmarks for refining market margins are to industry prices reported by platts a division of sp global 



revenues —revenues decreased by 3524 million or 43 in 2020 compared to 2019 lower product prices led to a revenue decrease of 34 relative to 2019 due to an average crude oil price decrease of approximately 21 per barrel in 2020 heavy crude oil processing rates decreased during 2020 due to reduced demand for refined products as a result of covid19 leading to a decrease in overall sales volumes of 9 rates on conversion units were lower due to an unplanned outage at our fluid catalytic cracking unit during the first two quarters of 2020 as well as crude selection and the optimization of refinery operations 

ebitda —ebitda decreased by 806 million in 2020 compared to 2019 during the third quarter of 2020 we recognized a noncash impairment charge of 582 million relating to our houston refinery’s asset group as a result of an expected prolonged period of reduced demand and compressed margins that will decrease profitability for transportation fuels produced by our houston refinery the lower profitability is primarily a result of the impacts of covid19 and associated reductions in mobility affecting the global economy in addition the refinery is expected to continue to be adversely affected by lower discounts for the heavy crude oil feedstocks that we utilize of the remaining decrease approximately twothirds relates to a decline in margins which reflect a 28 decrease in the maya 211 market margin in 2020 relative to 2019 driven primarily by lower refined product cracks and onethird relates to lower heavy crude oil processing rates driven by lower demand for refined products 

in efforts to manage costs within the segment we deferred nonsafety related discretionary activities and reduced the employee workforce by approximately 10 through early retirements and worker redeployments to our other facilities we plan to continue to operate the refinery at approximately 80 of nameplate capacity during the first quarter of 2021 and continue to evaluate options with regard to procuring crude oil and optimizing production from the asset 

technology segment 

overview —the technology segment recognizes revenues related to the sale of polyolefin catalysts and the licensing of chemical and polyolefin process technologies these revenues are offset in part by the costs incurred in the production of catalysts licensing and services activities and research and development “rd” activities in 2020 and 2019 our technology segment incurred approximately half of all rd costs ebitda for our technology segment decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 largely due to lower licensing revenues 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the technology segment 



revenues —revenues decreased by 4 million or 1 in 2020 compared to 2019 lower licensing revenues resulted in a revenue decrease of 9 in 2020 compared to 2019 higher catalyst volumes resulted in a 2 increase in revenue in 2020 driven by increased orders as customers were likely securing inventory during the pandemic increases in average catalyst sales prices resulted in revenue increases of 4 in 2020 driven by the growth of high yield catalyst foreign exchange impacts which on average were favorable led to a revenue increase of 2 in 2020 

ebitda —ebitda in 2020 decreased by 87 million or 21 compared to 2019 this decrease was primarily driven by lower licensing revenues due to lower average contract values in 2020 compared to 2019 

financial condition 

operating investing and financing activities of continuing operations which are discussed below are presented in the following table 



operating activities —cash of 3404 million generated by operating activities in 2020 reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items payments for employee related expenses income taxes and cash provided by the main components of working capital–accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable 

in 2020 the main components of working capital provided 311 million of cash driven by a decrease in inventories and an increase in accounts payable partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable the decrease in inventory was primarily driven by companywide inventory reduction initiatives to maximize liquidity the increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by increased raw material purchases during the fourth quarter of 2020 the increase in accounts receivable was driven by higher sales in the fourth quarter 2020 for our op—americas op—eai and id segments resulting from demand recovery 

other operating activities in 2020 includes the effects of changes in tax accruals primarily driven by a tax refund of 900 million for additional information see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

cash of 4961 million generated by operating activities in 2019 reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items payments for employee bonuses income taxes and cash consumed by the main components of working capital a 

113 million noncash reduction in unrecognized tax benefits is reflected in other operating activities in 2019 

in 2019 the main components of working capital consumed 13 million of cash driven by a decrease in accounts payable and an increase in inventories partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable the decrease in accounts payable was primarily driven by weaker demand in our aps segment and a decrease in certain raw material costs in our id segment the increase in inventories was a result of inventory builds as a result of planned and unplanned maintenance in our op—eai segment the decrease in accounts receivable was driven by decreases in our aps id and op—americas segments as a result of unfavorable market conditions 

investing activities 

acquisition of equity method investments —in 2020 we invested 2440 million in cash for 50 equity interests in the bora lyondellbasell petrochemical co ltd joint venture and the louisiana joint venture for additional information related to our equity investments see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements

capital expenditures —the following table summarizes capital expenditures for the periods presented 



as a result of covid19 and current market conditions during 2020 the company postponed select growth projects and planned maintenance including slowing certain construction activities allowing us to prevent the spread of the virus at the construction site and conserve capital as we prepared for an uncertain economic environment caused by the pandemic these actions resulted in a 500 million or 20 reduction in our 2020 capital expenditures compared to what was forecasted at the beginning of year 

capital expenditures decreased by 747 million or 28 in 2020 compared to 2019 the decrease was primarily due to lower spending within our op—americas segment which resulted in a decline of 21 primarily due to the completed construction of our hyperzone polyethylene plant in la porte texas and postponement of maintenance projects additionally lower spending within our id segment resulted in a 7 decline primarily as a result of the slowed construction activities at our potba plant at our houston texas facility 

financing activities —in 2020 and 2019 we made payments of 4 million and 3752 million to acquire approximately 01 million and 427 million respectively of our outstanding ordinary shares we also made dividend payments totaling 1405 million and 1462 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively for additional information related to our share repurchases and dividend payments see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

as a result of covid19 we continue to take actions to manage our financial risk in 2020 we increased our liquidity through the issuance of guaranteed notes and we continue to focus on cost savings while minimizing working capital in april 2020 we announced that we reduced our budgeted 2020 capital expenditures by 500 million to improve liquidity we intend to continue to declare and pay quarterly dividends with the goal of increasing the dividend over time after giving consideration to our cash balances and expected results from operations we remain committed to funding our dividends while maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet in the near term we are prioritizing debt reduction on our balance sheet 

we plan to fund our ongoing working capital capital expenditures debt service and other funding requirements with cash from operations which could be affected by general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory business and other factors many of which are beyond our control we believe that our current liquidity availability and cash from operating activities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due further we believe the current economic environment will not have an adverse effect on our ability to be in compliance with our debt covenants

in may 2020 our shareholders approved a proposal to authorize us to repurchase up to 340 million of our ordinary shares through november 29 2021 which superseded our prior repurchase authorization our share repurchase authorization does not have a stated dollar amount and purchases may be made through open market purchases private market transactions or other structured transactions repurchased shares could be retired or used for general corporate purposes including for various employee benefit and compensation plans the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased is not necessarily an indication of the number of shares that will ultimately be purchased in 2020 we purchased approximately 01 million shares under our share repurchase authorizations for approximately 4 million 

as of february 23 2021 we had approximately 340 million shares remaining under the current authorization the timing and amounts of additional shares repurchased if any will be determined based on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors including any additional authorizations approved by our shareholders in addition cash and cash equivalents cash from our shortterm investments cash from operating activities proceeds from the issuance of debt or a combination thereof may be used to fund the purchase of shares under our share repurchase authorization in the near term we are prioritizing debt reduction over share repurchases for additional information related to our share repurchase authorization see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

capital budget 

in 2021 we expect our capital budget spend to remain flat at approximately 2 billion which includes approximately 63 million for investments in our us and european po joint ventures approximately half of the 2021 budget is planned for profitgenerating growth projects primarily our potba plant with the remaining budget supporting sustaining maintenance we expect a similar level of capital expenditures for 2022 followed by a modest reduction in 2023 after completion of the potba facility 

once completed our worldscale potba plant in houston texas will have the capacity to produce 470 thousand tons of po and 10 million tons of tertiary butyl alcohol earlier in 2020 we slowed construction activities on our potba plant to ensure worksite safety and preserve liquidity during the pandemic during the fourth quarter we resumed activity the project is approximately 50 complete and expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022 approximately one year later than originally estimated the delayed timing of the startup should provide benefits from a more fully recovered global economy as well as another year of global demand growth for the products higher costs arising from the delayed project execution due to covid19 more extensive civil construction and unexpected tariffs on materials are expected to add approximately 40 to 50 to our original cost estimate of 24 billion 

equity investment 

on january 25 2021 we signed an agreement with china petroleum  chemical corporation to form ningbo zrcc lyondellbasell new material company limited a 5050 joint venture the joint venture will construct a new posm unit in zhenhai ningbo china the unit will use lyondellbasells leading posm technology and will have the capacity to produce 275 thousand tons of po and 600 thousand tons of sm per year products produced by the joint venture will be marketed equally by both partners expanding our respective participation in the chinese market the formation of the joint venture is subject to approvals by relevant government authorities including antitrust review by the state administration for market regulation we expect to make an equity contribution of approximately 100 million to the joint venture during the first half of 2021 and startup is expected at the end of 2021 the joint venture will be included within our id segment 

contractual and other obligations —the following table summarizes as of december 31 2020 our future minimum payments for longterm debt including current maturities shortterm debt and contractual and other obligations 



total debt —our debt includes unsecured senior notes guaranteed notes and various other us and nonus loans see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of covenant requirements under our credit facilities and indentures and additional information regarding our debt facilities 

interest on total debt —our debt and related party debt agreements contain provisions for the payment of monthly quarterly semiannual and annual interest at a stated or variable rate of interest over the term of the debt interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the rate in effect as of december 31 2020 

pension and other postretirement benefits —we maintain several defined benefit pension plans as described in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements many of our us and nonus plans are subject to minimum funding requirements however the amounts of required future contributions for all our plans are not fixed and can vary significantly due to changes in economic assumptions liability experience and investment return on plan assets as a result we have excluded pension and other postretirement benefit obligations from the contractual and other obligations table above our annual contributions may include amounts in excess of minimum required funding levels contributions to our nonus plans in years beyond 2021 are not expected to be materially different than the expected 2021 contributions disclosed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2020 the projected benefit obligation for our pension plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by 1482 million subject to future actuarial gains and losses as well as future asset earnings we together with our consolidated subsidiaries will be required to fund the discounted obligation of 1482 million in future years we contributed 74 million and 97 million to our pension plans in 2020 and 2019 respectively we provide other postretirement 

benefits primarily medical benefits to eligible participants as described in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements we pay other unfunded postretirement benefits as incurred 

contract liabilities —we are obligated to deliver products or services in connection with sales agreements under which customer payments were received before transfer of control to the customers occurs these contract liabilities will be recognized in earnings when control of the product or service is transferred to the customer the longterm portion of such advances totaled 37 million as of december 31 2020 

other —other primarily consists of accruals for taxes and employeerelated expenses 

deferred income taxes —the scheduled settlement of the deferred tax liabilities shown in the table is based on the scheduled reversal of the underlying temporary differences actual cash tax payments will vary depending upon future taxable income see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our deferred tax liabilities 

purchase obligations —we are party to various obligations to purchase products and services principally for raw materials utilities and industrial gases these commitments are designed to ensure sources of supply and are not expected to be in excess of normal requirements the commitments are segregated into takeorpay contracts and other contracts under the takeorpay contracts we are obligated to make minimum payments whether or not we take the product or service other contracts include contracts that specify minimum quantities however in the event that we do not take the contractual minimum we are only obligated for any resulting economic loss suffered by the vendor the payments shown for the other contracts assume that minimum quantities are purchased for contracts with variable pricing terms the minimum payments reflect the contract price at december 31 2020 

operating leases —we lease various facilities and equipment under noncancelable lease arrangements for various periods see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for related lease disclosures 

current business outlook 

improving trends seen in the closing weeks of december 2020 are continuing into the first quarter of 2021 and providing a bridge to the seasonal upticks typically seen in our businesses during the second and third quarters elevated export demand to china and latin america combined with tight markets are supporting strong margins for our olefins and polyolefins businesses in early 2021 we expect increased demand from automotive and construction markets to benefit our advanced polymer solutions segment with wider deployment of coronavirus vaccines we anticipate that increasing mobility and transportation fuel demand could provide upside for our oxyfuels and refining businesses during the latter half of 2021 in february 2021 unusually cold temperatures and associated electrical power outages led to shutdowns of the majority of the petrochemical and refining capacity along the united states gulf coast including lyondellbasell’s facilities in the region the majority of our capacity in the region was down for at least one week at this time we are continuing to assess the impact of the weather event and develop timelines for the restart of each of our affected facilities 

in the near term we are prioritizing debt reduction on our balance sheet 

related party transactions 

we have related party transactions with our joint venture partners we believe that such transactions are effected on terms substantially no more or less favorable than those that would have been agreed upon by unrelated parties on an arm’s length basis see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional related party disclosures 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management applies those accounting policies that it believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the us see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management and updated periodically based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment 

management believes the following accounting policies and estimates and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them are critical in understanding our reported operating results and financial condition 

inventories —we account for our raw materials workinprogress and finished goods inventories using the lastin firstout “lifo” method of accounting 

the cost of raw materials which represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses and energy costs generally follow price trends for crude oil andor natural gas crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to many factors including changes in economic conditions 

since our inventory consists of manufactured products derived from crude oil natural gas natural gas liquids and correlated materials as well as the associated feedstocks and intermediate chemicals our inventory market values are generally influenced by changes in the benchmark of crude oil and heavy liquid values and prices for manufactured finished goods the degree of influence of a particular benchmark may vary from period to period as the composition of the dollar value lifo pools change due to natural inventory composition changes variation in pricing from period to period does not necessarily result in a linear lower of cost or market “lcm” impact additionally an lcm condition may arise due to a volumetric decline in a particular material that had previously provided a positive impact within a pool as a result market valuations and lcm conditions are dependent upon the composition and mix of materials on hand at the balance sheet date in the measurement of an lcm adjustment the numeric input value for determining the crude oil market price includes pricing that is weighted by volume of inventories held at a point in time including wti brent and maya crude oils 

as indicated above fluctuation in the prices of crude oil natural gas and correlated products from period to period may result in the recognition of charges to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in periods of falling prices and the reversal of those charges in subsequent interim periods as market prices recover accordingly our cost of sales and results of operations may be affected by such fluctuations 

during 2020 commodity price volatility resulted in a large lcm inventory charge during the first quarter which was substantially reversed by the end of the year resulting in an lcm inventory valuation charges of 16 million for the year 

in the first quarter of 2020 we recognized lcm inventory valuation charges of 419 million which was driven by a decline in pricing for many of our raw material and finished goods inventories during the second third and fourth quarters of 2020 we recognized an lcm inventory valuation benefit of 96 million 160 million and 147 million respectively as market prices began to recover subsequent to the first quarter of 2020 

market price volatility for crude oil heavy liquids and ethylene were the primary contributors to the lcm inventory valuation charges and representative prices used to determine the lcm inventory valuation charges recognized during the year ranged from 1214 to 4175 per barrel for crude oil 1350 to 5107 per barrel for heavy liquids and 205 to 767 per ton for ethylene 

currently four out of our eleven lifo inventory pools are “atrisk” for further adjustment as each impacted lifo pool has been reduced to or close to the calculated market value at the last balance sheet measurement date “atrisk” inventory accounts for 15 billion of our total inventory carrying value as of december 31 2020 sustained price declines in our finished goods and raw materials could result in future lcm inventory valuation charges the extent to which further adjustment may occur is dependent on the pool specific product prices and composition within each individual dollar value lifo pool at the balance sheet date 

longlived assets impairment assessment —the need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced a weakened outlook for profitability a significant reduction in margins other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment if the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows for an asset group is less than the asset group’s carrying value fair value is calculated for the asset group and the carrying value is written down to the calculated fair value for purposes of impairment evaluation longlived assets including finitelived intangible assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified 

fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our longlived assets for impairment is estimated using a discounted cash flow model and comparative market prices when appropriate significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted financial information prepared using significant assumptions which may include among other things projected changes in supply and demand fundamentals including industrywide capacity our planned utilization rate and enduser demand new technological developments capital expenditures new competitors with significant raw material or other cost advantages changes associated with world economies the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries uncertainties associated with governmental actions and other economic conditions such estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment and business performance reviews 

the cash flows are discounted using a rate that is based on a variety of factors including market and economic conditions operational risk regulatory risk and political risk this discount rate is also compared to recent observable market transactions if possible 

houston refinery impairment —during the third quarter of 2020 we identified impairment triggers relating to our houston refinery’s asset group which resulted in a 582 million impairment charge recognized during the third quarter of 2020 refer to note 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

the estimates of the houston refinery’s undiscounted pretax cash flows and estimated fair value utilized significant assumptions including management’s best estimates of the expected future cash flows the estimated useful lives of the asset group and the residual value of the refinery these estimates required considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions such as future commodity prices margins on refined products operating rates and capital expenditures including repairs and maintenance as a result there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our impairment determination will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future should our estimates and assumptions significantly change in future periods it is possible that we may determine future impairment charges in addition assumptions about the effects of covid19 and the macroeconomic environment are inherently subjective and contingent upon the duration of the pandemic and its impact on the macroeconomic environment which is difficult to forecast we base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable however actual results may differ from these projections 

an estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable given the numerous assumptions including pricing volumes and discount rates that can materially affect our estimates that is unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions 

equity method investments impairment —investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment when there are indicators of a loss in value such as a lack of sustained earnings capacity or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount 

when it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value when determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline the investee’s financial condition and nearterm prospects and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the value of the investment management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on the income approach andor market approach for the income approach the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants for the market approach since quoted market prices are usually not available we utilize market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded industrial gases companies 

goodwill —as of december 31 2020 we have goodwill of 1953 million of this amount 1357 million is related to the acquisition of a schulman in 2018 which is included in our aps segment and is mainly attributed to acquired workforce and expected synergies the remaining goodwill at december 31 2020 primarily represents the tax effect of the differences between the tax and book basis of our assets and liabilities resulting from the revaluation of those assets and liabilities to fair value in connection with the company’s emergence from bankruptcy and freshstart accounting in 2010 additional information on the amount of goodwill allocated to our reporting units appears in note 7 and note 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill of a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors assessed for each of the reporting units include but are not limited to changes in longterm commodity prices discount rates competitive environments planned capacity cost factors such as raw material prices and financial performance of the reporting units if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a quantitative test is required 

we also have the option to proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test under the quantitative impairment test the fair value of each reporting unit calculated using a discounted cash flow model is compared to its carrying value including goodwill the discounted cash flow model inherently utilizes a significant number of estimates and assumptions including operating margins tax rates discount rates capital expenditures and working capital changes if the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds its fair value an impairment charge equal to the excess would be recognized up to a maximum amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

for 2020 and 2019 management performed a qualitative impairment assessment of our reporting units which indicated that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their carrying value including goodwill accordingly a quantitative goodwill impairment test was not required and no goodwill impairment was recognized in 2020 or 2019 

longterm employee benefit costs —our costs for longterm employee benefits particularly pension and other postretirement medical and life insurance benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is management’s responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent its best estimates of the future effects of those uncertainties and to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors 

the current benefit service costs as well as the existing liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis the discount rate is a current rate related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled our assumed discount rate is based on yield information for highquality corporate bonds with durations comparable to the expected cash settlement of our obligations for the purpose of measuring the benefit obligations at december 31 2020 we used a weighted average discount rate of 254 for the us plans which reflects the different terms of the related benefit obligations the weighted average discount rate used to measure obligations for nonus plans at december 31 2020 was 099 reflecting market interest rates the discount rates in effect at december 31 2020 will be used to measure net periodic benefit cost during 2021 

the benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost of other postretirement medical benefits are also measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits as of december 31 2020 the assumed rate of increase for our us plans was 65 decreasing to 45 in 2029 and thereafter 

the net periodic benefit cost of pension benefits included in expense is affected by the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption investment returns that are recognized currently in net income represent the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets applied to a marketrelated value of plan assets which is defined as the market value of assets the expected rate of return on plan assets is a longerterm rate and is expected to change less frequently than the current assumed discount rate reflecting longterm market expectations rather than current fluctuations in market conditions 

the weighted average expected longterm rate of return on assets in our us plans of 725 is based on the average level of earnings that our independent pension investment advisor advised could be expected to be earned over time the weighted average expected longterm rate of return on assets in our nonus plans of 179 is based on expectations and asset allocations that vary by region the asset allocations are summarized in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets management’s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 

net periodic pension cost recognized each year includes the expected asset earnings rather than the actual earnings or loss along with other gains and losses this unrecognized amount to the extent it cumulatively exceeds 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of the plan assets for the respective plan is recognized as additional net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service period of the participants in each plan 

the following table reflects the sensitivity of the benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans to changes in the actuarial assumptions 



the sensitivity of our postretirement benefit plans obligations and net periodic benefit costs to changes in actuarial assumptions are reflected in the following table 



additional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

accruals for taxes based on income —the determination of our provision for income taxes and the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities is subject to management’s estimates and judgments due to the complexity of the tax laws and regulations in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of these complex laws and regulations 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 

we recognize future tax benefits to the extent that the realization of these benefits is more likely than not our current provision for income taxes is impacted by the recognition and release of valuation allowances related to net deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions further changes to these valuation allowances may impact our future provision for income taxes which will include no tax benefit with respect to losses incurred and no tax expense with respect to income generated in these countries until the respective valuation allowance is eliminated 

we recognize the financial statement benefits with respect to an uncertain income tax position that we have taken or may take on an income tax return when we believe it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of lyondellbasell industries nv’s management of commodity price risk foreign currency exposure and interest rate risk through its use of derivative instruments and hedging activities 

commodity price risk 

our products and raw materials are subject to changes in market price as supply and demand fundamentals change natural gas crude oil and refined products along with feedstocks for ethylene and propylene production constitute the main commodity exposures we try to protect against such instability through various business strategies including provisions in sales contracts which allows us to pass on higher raw material costs to our customers through timely price increases and through the use of commodity swap and futures contracts 

at december 31 2020 and 2019 an instantaneous parallel shift up or down in the underlying commodity price of 10 and no corresponding change in the underlying implied volatilities of those prices would have resulted in an additional impact to other comprehensive loss of approximately 11 million and less than 1 million respectively 

foreign exchange risk 

we manufacture and market our products in many countries throughout the world and as a result are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

a significant portion of our reporting entities use the euro as their functional currency our reporting currency is the us dollar the translation gains or losses that result from the process of translating the euro denominated financial statements to us dollars are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until such time as those entities may be liquidated or sold changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro can therefore have a significant impact on comprehensive income 

we have entered into hedging arrangements designated as net investment hedges to reduce the volatility in shareholders’ equity resulting from foreign currency fluctuation associated with our net investments in foreign operations the table below illustrates the impact on other comprehensive loss of a 10 fluctuation in the foreign currency rate associated with each net investment hedge and the euribor and libor rates associated with the crosscurrency basis swaps at december 31 



some of our operations enter into transactions that are not denominated in their functional currency this results in exposure to foreign currency risk for financial instruments including but not limited to third party and intercompany receivables and payables and intercompany loans 

our policy is to maintain a balanced position in foreign currencies to minimize exchange gains and losses arising from changes in exchange rates to minimize the effects of our net currency exchange exposures we enter into foreign exchange contracts and crosscurrency swaps we also engage in shortterm foreign exchange swaps in order to roll certain hedge positions and to make funds available for intercompany financing our net position in foreign currencies is monitored daily 

we maintain risk management control practices to monitor the foreign currency risk attributable to our intercompany and third party outstanding foreign currency balances these practices involve the centralization of our exposure to underlying currencies that are not subject to central bank andor country specific restrictions by centralizing most of our foreign currency exposure into one subsidiary we are able to take advantage of any natural offsets thereby reducing the overall impact of changes in foreign currency rates on our earnings at december 31 2020 and 2019 a 10 fluctuation compared to the us dollar in the underlying currencies that have no central bank or other currency restrictions related to nonhedged monetary net assets would have resulted in an additional impact to earnings of approximately 4 million and 2 million respectively 

at december 31 2020 noncancellable crosscurrency swaps with an aggregated notional of 2005 million  were designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges to reduce the variability in the functional currency equivalent cash flows of certain foreign currency denominated intercompany notes these foreign currency contracts have maturity dates ranging from 2021 to 2027 and their fair value was a net liability of 259 million  a 10 fluctuation compared to the us dollar would have resulted in an additional impact to other comprehensive loss of approximately 250 million and 238 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively 

other income net in the consolidated statements of income reflected net exchange rate foreign currency losses of 7 million gains of 9 million and 24 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively for forward contracts including swap transactions that economically hedge recognized monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies no hedge accounting is applied changes in the fair value of foreign currency forward and swap contracts are reported in the consolidated statements of income and offset the currency exchange results recognized on the assets and liabilities at december 31 2020 these foreign currency contracts which will mature between january 2021 and june 2021  inclusively had an aggregated notional amount of 225 million and the fair value was a net liability of 1 million  a 10 fluctuation compared to the us dollar would have resulted in an additional impact to earnings of approximately 5 million and 31 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk management is viewed as a tradeoff between cost and risk the cost of interest is generally lower for shortterm debt and higher for longterm debt and lower for floating rate debt and higher for fixed rate debt however the risk associated with interest rates is inversely related to the cost with shortterm debt carrying a higher refinancing risk and floating rate debt having higher interest rate volatility our interest rate risk management strategy attempts to optimize this costriskreward tradeoff 

we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our fixed and variable rate debt fluctuations in interest rates impact the fair value of fixedrate debt as well as pretax earnings stemming from interest expense on variablerate debt to minimize earnings at risk as part of our interest rate risk management strategy we target to maintain floating rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps and issuance of floating rate debt equal to our cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and triparty repurchase agreements as those assets are invested in floating rate instruments 

preissuance interest rate —a preissuance interest rate strategy is utilized to mitigate the risk that benchmark interest rates ie us treasury midswaps etc will increase between the time a decision has been made to issue debt and when the actual debt offering is issued at december 31 2020 the total notional amount of our interest rate contracts designated as cash flow hedges which have maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2024 was 1000 million and the fair value was a net liability of 343 million  we estimate that a 10 change in market interest rates as of december 31 2020 and 2019 would change the fair value of our forwardstarting interest rate swaps outstanding and would have resulted in an impact on other comprehensive loss of approximately 44 million and 66 million respectively 

fixedrate debt —we enter into interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy at december 31 2020 the total notional amount of an interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge which matures in 2026 was 122 million and their fair value was a net asset of 2 million  

at december 31 2020 after giving consideration to the 122 million of fixedrate debt that we have effectively converted to floating through these fixedforfloating interest rate swaps approximately 83 of our debt portfolio on a gross basis incurred interest at a fixedrate and the remaining 17 of the portfolio incurred interest at a variablerate we estimate that a 10 change in market interest rates as of december 31 2020 and 2019 would change the fair value of our interest rate swaps outstanding and would have resulted in an impact on our pretax income of approximately less than 1 million and 15 million respectively 

variablerate debt —our variable rate debt consists of our 2500 million senior revolving credit facility our 900 million us receivables facility our term loan due 2022 our guaranteed floating rate notes due 2023 and our commercial paper program at december 31 2020 there were no outstanding borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility and our us receivables facility at december 31 2020 our term loan due 2022 guaranteed floating rate notes due 2023 and commercial paper program had carrying values of 1448 million 646 million and 500 million respectively based on our average variablerate debt outstanding per year we estimate that a 10 change in market interest rates would have had 3 million and 1 million impact on earnings in 2020 and 2019 respectively

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

overview 

lyondellbasell industries nv is a global independent chemical company and was incorporated as a naamloze vennootschap under dutch law on october 15 2009 unless otherwise indicated the “company” “we” “our” “us” and “lyondellbasell” are used in this report to refer to the businesses of lyondellbasell industries nv and its consolidated subsidiaries we are one of the world’s top independent chemical companies based on revenues 

we participate globally across the petrochemical value chain and are an industry leader in many of our product lines our chemicals businesses consist primarily of large processing plants that convert large volumes of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon feedstocks into plastic resins and other chemicals our chemical products tend to be basic building blocks for other chemicals and plastics our plastic products are used in large volumes as well as smaller specialty applications our customers use our plastics and chemicals to manufacture a wide range of products that people use in their everyday lives including food packaging home furnishings automotive components paints and coatings our refining business consists of our houston refinery which processes crude oil into refined products such as gasoline diesel and jet fuel we also develop and license chemical and polyolefin process technologies and manufacture and sell polyolefin catalysts 

our financial performance is influenced by the supply and demand for our products the cost and availability of feedstocks and commodity products global and regional production capacity our operational efficiency and our ability to control costs we have a strong operational focus and as a producer of large volume commodities continuously strive to differentiate ourselves through safe reliable and lowcost operations in all our businesses we purchase large quantities of natural gas electricity and steam which we use as energy to fuel our facilities we also purchase large quantities of natural gas liquids and crude oil derivatives which we use as feedstocks during recent years the relatively low cost of natural gasderived raw materials in the us versus the global cost of crude oilderived raw materials has had a significant positive influence on the profitability of our north american operations while increased supply has reduced the north american feedstock advantage improved product supply and demand fundamentals in several businesses notably global polyolefins products have partially offset the decline

we manage our operations through six operating segments our reportable segments are 



financial information about our business segments and geographical areas can be found in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements information about the locations where we produce our primary products can be found under “description of properties” no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues in 2019  2018 and 2017  

olefins and polyolefins segments generally 

we are one of the leading worldwide producers of olefins and polyethylene “pe” and we are the world’s second largest producer of polypropylene “pp” we manage our olefin and polyolefin business in two reportable segments op–americas and op — eai 

olefins  coproducts —ethylene is the most significant petrochemical in terms of worldwide production volume and is the key building block for pe and many other chemicals and plastics ethylene is produced by steam cracking hydrocarbons such as ethane propane butane and naphtha this production results in coproducts such as aromatics and other olefins including propylene and butadiene ethylene and its coproducts are fundamental to many parts of the economy including the production of consumer products packaging housing and automotive components and other durable and nondurable goods 

polyolefins —polyolefins such as pe and pp are polymers derived from olefins including ethylene and propylene polyolefins are the most widely used thermoplastics in the world and are found in applications and products that enhance the everyday quality of life our products are used in consumer automotive and industrial applications ranging from food and beverage packaging to housewares and construction materials 

polyethylene —we produce high density polyethylene “hdpe” low density polyethylene “ldpe” and linear low density polyethylene pe sales accounted for approximately 17  19 and 21 of our total revenues in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

polypropylene —we produce pp homopolymers and copolymers pp sales accounted for approximately 14  15 and 17 of our total revenues in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

olefins and polyolefins—americas segment 

overview 

our op–americas segment produces and markets olefins and coproducts polyethylene and polypropylene 

sales  marketing  customers 

most of the ethylene we produce is consumed internally as a raw material in the production of pe and other derivatives with the balance sold to third party customers primarily under multiyear contracts 

we use all the propylene we produce in the production of pp propylene oxide and other derivatives of those products we also purchase propylene from third parties in addition to purchases of propylene we purchase ethylene for resale when necessary to satisfy customer demand above our own production levels volumes of any of these products purchased for resale can vary significantly from period to period and are typically most significant during extended outages of our own production such as during planned maintenance however purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profits except to the extent that they replace lowercost production 

most of the ethylene and propylene production from our channelview corpus christi and la porte texas facilities is shipped via a pipeline system which has connections to numerous us gulf coast consumers this pipeline extends from corpus christi to mont belvieu texas in addition exchange agreements with other ethylene and coproducts producers allow access to customers who are not directly connected to this pipeline system some ethylene is shipped by railcar from our clinton iowa facility to our morris illinois facility and some is shipped directly to customers propylene from clinton and morris is generally shipped by marine vessel barge railcar or truck 

in 2019 we added a total of 85 thousand tons of pp capacity at our facilities in north america our pp and pe production is typically sold through our sales organization to an extensive base of established customers and distributors servicing both the domestic and export markets either under annual contracts or on a spot basis we have sales offices in various locations in north america and our polyolefins are primarily transported in north america by railcar or truck export sales are primarily to customers in latin america with sales to asia expected to increase in the coming years as global supply and demand balances shift we also consume pp in our pp compounds business which is managed worldwide by our aps segment in addition we expect additional capacity from our hyperzone polyethylene plant in 2020 

joint venture relationships 

we participate in a joint venture in mexico which provides us with capacity of approximately 290 thousand tons of pp production per year the capacity is based on our percentage ownership of the joint venture’s total capacity we do not hold a majority interest in or have operational control of this joint venture 

raw materials 

raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost to produce ethylene and its coproducts the primary raw materials used in our americas olefin facilities are natural gas liquids “ngls” and heavy liquids heavy liquids include crude oilbased naphtha and other refined products as well as condensate a very light crude oil resulting from natural gas production ngls include ethane propane and butane the use of heavy liquid raw materials results in the production of significant volumes of coproducts such as propylene butadiene and benzene as well as gasoline blending components while the use of ngls results in the production of a smaller volume of coproducts 

our ability to pass on raw material price increases to our customers is dependent on marketdriven demand for olefins and polyolefins sales prices for products sold in the spot market are determined by market forces our contract prices are influenced by product supply and demand conditions spot prices indices published in industry publications and in some instances cost recovery formulas 

we can manufacture olefins by utilizing a variety of feedstocks including heavy liquids and ngls technological advances for extracting shalebased oil and gas have led to an increased supply of ngls providing a cost advantage over heavy liquids particularly in the us a plant’s flexibility to consume a wide range of raw materials generally provides an advantage over plants that are restricted in their processing capabilities our americas’ facilities can process significant quantities of either heavy liquids or ngls we estimate that in the us we can produce up to approximately 90 of our total ethylene output using ngls changes in the raw material feedstock mix utilized in the production process will result in variances in production capacities among products we believe our raw material flexibility in the us is a key advantage in our production of ethylene and its coproducts 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to olefins and polyolefins competition is based on price and to a lesser extent on product quality product delivery reliability of supply product performance and customer service profitability is affected not only by supply and demand for olefins and polyolefins but also by raw material costs and price competition among producers which may intensify due to among other things the addition of new capacity in general demand is a function of worldwide demographic and economic growth including the regional dynamics that underlie global growth trends 

we compete in north america with other large marketers and producers including global chemical companies chemical divisions of large oil companies and regional marketers and producers 

based on published capacity data we believe as of december 31 2019 we were 





olefins and polyolefins—europe asia international segment 

overview 

our op–eai segment produces and markets olefins and coproducts polyethylene and polypropylene 

sales  marketing  customers 

our ethylene production is primarily consumed internally as a raw material in the production of polyolefins and we purchase additional ethylene as needed to meet our production needs our propylene production is used as a raw material in the production of pp and propylene oxide and derivatives of those products and we regularly purchase propylene from third parties because our internal needs exceed our internal production 

with respect to pp and pe our production is typically sold through our sales organization to an extensive base of established customers under annual contracts or on a spot basis and is also sold through distributors our polyolefins are primarily transported in europe by railcar or truck in 2019 we added a total of 85 thousand tons of pp capacity at our whollyowned and joint venture facilities this capacity is based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint ventures’ total capacities 

our regional sales offices are in various locations including the netherlands hong kong china india australia and the united arab emirates we also operate through a worldwide network of local sales and representative offices in europe asia and africa our joint ventures described below typically manage their domestic sales and marketing efforts independently and we typically operate as their agent or distributor for all or a portion of their exports 

joint venture relationships 

we participate in several manufacturing joint ventures in saudi arabia poland south korea thailand and the netherlands we do not hold majority interests in any of these joint ventures nor do we have operational control these ventures provide us with additional annual production capacity of approximately 11 million tons of pp approximately 640 thousand tons of olefins and approximately 420 thousand tons of pe these capacities are based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint ventures’ total capacities we realize profits or losses from these ventures as income or loss on the equity basis of accounting 

we generally license our polyolefin process technologies and supply catalysts to our joint ventures through our technology segment some of our joint ventures are able to source cost advantaged raw materials from their local shareholders 

raw materials 

raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost for the production of olefins and coproducts historically the primary raw material used in our european olefin facilities was naphtha however in recent years we increased our use of advantaged ngls for our saudi arabian joint venture facilities locally sourced and cost advantaged ngls including ethane propane and butane are used the principal raw materials used in the production of polyolefins are propylene and ethylene in europe we have the capacity to produce approximately 50 of the propylene requirements for our european pp production and all of the ethylene requirements for our european pe production propylene and ethylene requirements that are not produced internally are generally 

acquired pursuant to longterm contracts with third party suppliers or via spot purchases some of our joint ventures receive propylene and ethylene from their local shareholders under longterm contracts 

our ability to pass through the increased cost of raw materials to customers is dependent on global market demand for olefins and polyolefins in general the pricing for purchases and sales of most products is determined by global market forces including the impacts of foreign exchange relative to the pricing of the underlying naphtha raw materials most of which are priced in us dollars there can be a lag between naphtha raw material price changes and contract product price changes that will cause volatility in our product margins 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to olefins and polyolefins competition is based on price product quality product delivery reliability of supply product performance and customer service we compete with regional and multinational chemical companies and divisions of large oil companies the petrochemical market in the european union “eu” has been affected by the price volatility of naphtha the primary feedstock for olefins in the region as well as fluctuating demand as a result of changing european and global economic conditions 

based on published capacity data and including our proportionate share of our joint ventures we believe as of december 31 2019 we were 



intermediates and derivatives segment 

overview 

our id segment produces and markets propylene oxide “po” and its derivatives oxyfuels and related products and intermediate chemicals such as styrene monomer “sm” acetyls and ethylene oxides and derivatives 

po and derivatives— we produce po through two distinct technologies one of which yields tertiary butyl alcohol “tba” as the coproduct and the other of which yields sm as the coproduct the two technologies are mutually exclusive with dedicated assets for manufacturing either potba or posm po is an intermediate commodity chemical and is a precursor of polyols propylene glycol propylene glycol ethers and butanediol po and derivatives are used in a variety of durable and consumable items with key applications such as polyurethanes used for insulation automotivefurniture cushioning coatings surfactants synthetic resins and several other household usages 

oxyfuels and related products —we produce two distinct etherbased oxyfuels methyl tertiary butyl ether “mtbe” and ethyl tertiary butyl ether “etbe” these oxyfuels are produced by converting the tba coproduct of po into isobutylene and reacting with methanol or ethanol to produce either mtbe or etbe both are used as highoctane gasoline components that help gasoline burn cleaner and reduce automobile emissions other tba derivatives which we refer to as “c4 chemicals” are largely used to make synthetic rubber and other gasoline additives 

intermediate chemicals —we produce other commodity chemicals that utilize ethylene as a key component feedstock including sm acetyls and ethylene oxide derivatives sm is utilized in various applications such as plastics expandable polystyrene for packaging foam cups and containers insulation products and durables and engineering resins our acetyls products comprise methanol glacial acetic acid “gaa” and vinyl acetate monomer 

“vam” natural gas methane is the feedstock for methanol some of which is converted to gaa and a portion of the gaa is reacted with ethylene to create vam vam is an intermediate chemical used in fabric or wood treatments pigments coatings films and adhesives ethylene oxide is an intermediate chemical that is used to produce ethylene glycol glycol ethers and other derivatives ethylene oxide and its derivatives are used in the production of polyester antifreeze fluids solvents and other chemical products 

sales  marketing  customers 

we sell our po and derivatives through multiyear sales and processing agreements as well as spot sales some of our contract sales agreements have cost plus pricing terms po and derivatives are transported by barge marine vessel pipeline railcar and tank truck 

we sell our oxyfuels and related products under market and costbased sales agreements and in the spot market oxyfuels are transported by barge marine vessel and tank truck and are used as octane blending components worldwide outside of the united states due to their blending characteristics and emission benefits c4 chemicals such as highpurity isobutylene are sold to producers of synthetic rubber and other chemical products primarily in the united states and europe and are transported by railcar tank truck pipeline and marine shipments 

intermediate chemicals are shipped by barge marine vessel pipeline railcar and tank truck sm is sold globally into regions such as north america europe asia and south america export markets through spot sales and commercial contracts within acetyls methanol is consumed internally to make gaa used as a feedstock for oxyfuels and related products and also sold directly into the merchant commercial market gaa is converted with ethylene to produce vam which is sold worldwide under multiyear commercial contracts and on a spot basis 

sales of our po and derivatives oxyfuels and related products and intermediate chemicals are made by our marketing and sales personnel and also through distributors and independent agents in the americas europe the middle east africa and the asiapacific region 

joint venture relationships 

we have two po joint ventures with covestro ag one in the us and one in europe we operate four of the us po production facilities for the us po joint venture covestro’s interest represents ownership of an inkind portion of the po production of 680 thousand tons per year we take inkind the remaining po production and all coproduct production the parties’ rights in the joint venture are based on offtake volumes related to actual production of po as opposed to ownership percentages covestro also has the right to 50 of the po and sm production of our european po joint venture our proportional production capacity provided through this venture is approximately 155 thousand tons of po and approximately 340 thousand tons of sm we do not share marketing or product sales with covestro under either of these po joint ventures 

we also have a joint venture manufacturing relationship in china this venture provides us with additional production capacity of approximately 50 thousand tons of po this capacity is based on our operational share of the joint venture’s total capacity 

raw materials 

the cost of raw materials is the largest component of total production cost for po its coproducts and its derivatives propylene isobutane or mixed butane ethylene and benzene are the primary raw materials used in the production of po and its coproducts the market prices of these raw materials historically have been related to the price of crude oil ngls and natural gas as well as supply and demand for the raw materials 

in the us we obtain a large portion of our propylene benzene and ethylene raw materials needed for the production of po and its coproducts from our op — americas segment and to a lesser extent from third parties raw materials for the nonus production of po and its coproducts are obtained from our op — eai segment and 

from third parties we consume a significant portion of our internallyproduced po in the production of po derivatives 

the raw material requirements not sourced internally are purchased at marketbased prices from numerous suppliers in the us and europe with which we have established contractual relationships as well as in the spot market 

for the production of oxyfuels we purchase our ethanol feedstock requirements from third parties and obtain our methanol from both internal production and external sources carbon monoxide and methanol are the primary raw materials required for the production of gaa we source carbon monoxide from internal production which can be complemented by purchases from external sources as needed the methanol required for our downstream production of acetyls is internally sourced from our methanol plants in la porte texas and channelview texas natural gas is the primary raw material required for the production of methanol 

in addition to ethylene acetic acid is a primary raw material for the production of vam we obtain all our requirements for acetic acid and ethylene from our internal production historically we have used a large percentage of our acetic acid production to produce vam 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to product competition the market is influenced and based on a variety of factors including product quality price reliability of supply technical support customer service and potential substitute materials profitability is affected by the worldwide level of demand along with price competition which may intensify due to among other things new industry capacity and industry outages demand growth could be impacted by further development of alternative biobased methodologies our major worldwide competitors include other multinational chemical and refining companies as well as some regional marketers and producers 

based on published capacity data excluding our partners’ shares of joint venture capacity we believe as of december 31 2019 we were 



advanced polymer solutions segment 

overview 

we formed the aps segment following our acquisition of a schulman inc “a schulman” in august 2018 our aps segment produces and markets compounding and solutions such as polypropylene compounds engineered plastics masterbatches colors and powders engineered composites and advanced polymers which includes catalloy and polybutene1 polyolefin resins 

compounding and solutions —our polypropylene compounds are produced from blends of polyolefins and additives and are largely focused on automotive applications engineered plastics and engineered composites add value for more specialized highperformance applications used across a variety of industries masterbatches are compounds that provide differentiated properties when combined with commodity plastics used in packaging agriculture and durable goods applications specialty powders are largely used to mold toys industrial tanks and sporting goods such as kayaks performance colors provide powdered pelletized and liquid color concentrates for the plastics industry 

advanced polymers — catalloy and polybutene1 are unique polymers that can be used within the aps segment for downstream compounding or can be sold as raw materials to third parties catalloy is a line of differentiated propylenebased polymers that add value in packaging applications and construction materials such as the white membranes used in the commercial roofing market polybutene1 is used in both specialty piping and packaging applications 

sales  marketing  customers 

our products are sold through our global sales organization to a broad base of established customers and distributors under contract or on a spot basis these products are transported to our customers primarily by either truck or bulk rail 

joint venture relationships 

we participate in several manufacturing joint ventures in saudi arabia australia indonesia malaysia thailand china and argentina we hold majority interests and have operational control of the joint ventures in argentina and indonesia we do not hold majority interests in any of the remaining joint ventures nor do we have operational control these ventures provide us with additional production capacity of approximately 140 thousand tons of compounding and solutions these capacities are based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint ventures’ total capacities 

raw materials 

the principal materials used in the production of our compounding and solutions products are polypropylene polyethylene polystyrene nylon and titanium dioxide raw materials required for the production of our compounding and solutions products are obtained from our wholly owned or joint venture facilities and from a number of major plastic resin producers or other suppliers at marketbased prices 

the principal raw materials used in the production of advanced polymers are ethylene propylene and butene1 ethylene and propylene requirements that are not produced internally and externallysupplied butene1 are acquired through longterm contracts with third party suppliers or via spot purchases 

our ability to pass through the increased cost of raw materials to customers is dependent on global market demand in general the pricing for purchases and sales of most products is determined by global market forces 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to product competition the market is influenced and based on a variety of factors including price product quality product delivery reliability of supply product performance and customer service we compete with regional and multinational marketers and producers of plastic resins and compounds 

based on published capacity data and including our proportionate share of our joint ventures we believe as of december 31 2019  we were the largest global producer of polypropylene compounds 

refining segment 

overview 

the primary products of our refining segment are refined products made from heavy highsulfur crude oil and other crude oils of varied types and sources available on the us gulf coast these refined products include gasoline and other distillates 

sales  marketing  customers 

the houston refinery’s products are primarily sold in bulk to other refiners marketers distributors and wholesalers at marketrelated prices most of the houston refinery’s products are sold under contracts with a term of one year or less or are sold in the spot market the houston refinery’s products generally are transported to customers via pipelines and terminals owned and operated by other parties the sales of refined products accounted for approximately 22  21 and 18 of our total revenues in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

raw materials 

our houston refinery which is located on the houston ship channel in houston texas has a heavy highsulfur crude oil processing capacity of approximately 268 thousand barrels per day on a calendar day basis normal operating basis or approximately 292 thousand barrels per day on a stream day basis maximum achievable over a 24hour period the houston refinery is a full conversion refinery designed to refine heavy highsulfur crude oil this crude oil is more viscous and denser than traditional crude oil and contains higher concentrations of sulfur and heavy metals making it more difficult to refine into gasoline and other highvalue fuel products while heavy highsulfur crude oil has historically been less costly to purchase than light lowsulfur crude oil in recent years the price difference has narrowed us production is predominantly light sweet crude and much of the heavy crude has generally been imported from canada venezuela and other global producers which has at times been subject to supply disruptions 

we purchase the crude oil used as a raw material for the houston refinery on the open market on a spot basis and under a number of supply agreements with regional producers generally with terms varying from one to two years 

industry dynamics  competition 

our refining competitors are major integrated oil companies refineries owned or controlled by foreign governments and independent domestic refiners based on published data as of january 2019 there were 135 operable crude oil refineries in the us and total us refinery capacity was approximately 188 million barrels per day during 2019 the houston refinery processed an average of approximately 263 thousand barrels per day of heavy crude oil 

our refining operations compete for the purchases of crude oil based on price and quality supply disruptions could impact the availability and pricing we compete in gasoline and distillate markets as a bulk supplier of fungible products satisfying industry and government specifications competition is based on price and location 

the markets for fuel products tend to be volatile as well as cyclical due to supply and demand fundamentals and changing crude oil and refined product prices crude oil prices are impacted by worldwide political events the economics of exploration and production and refined products demand prices and demand for fuel products are influenced by seasonal and shortterm factors such as weather and driving patterns as well as by longer term issues such as the economy energy conservation and alternative fuels industry fuel products supply is dependent on shortterm industry operating capabilities and on longterm refining capacity 

a crack spread is a benchmark indication of refining margins based on the processing of a specific type of crude oil into an assumed selection of major refined products the houston refinery generally tracks the maya 211 crack spread which represents the difference between the current month gulf coast price of two barrels of maya crude oil as set by petróleos mexicanos “pemex” and one barrel each of us gulf coast reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending “rbob” gasoline and of us gulf coast ultra low sulfur diesel “ulsd” while these benchmark refining spreads are generally indicative of the level of profitability at the houston refinery and similarly configured refineries there are many other factors specific to each refinery and the industry in general such as the value of refinery byproducts which influence operating results refinery byproducts are products other than gasoline and distillates that represent about onethird of the total product volume and include coke sulfur and lighter materials such as ngls and crude olefins streams the cost of renewable identification numbers “rins” which are renewable fuel credits mandated by the us environmental protection agency the “epa” can also affect profitability 

technology segment 

overview 

our technology segment develops and licenses chemical and polyolefin process technologies and manufactures and sells polyolefin catalysts we market our process technologies and our polyolefin catalysts to external customers and also use them in our own manufacturing operations over the past three years approximately 15 to 25 of our catalyst sales were intercompany 

our polyolefin process licenses are structured to provide a standard core technology with individual customer needs met by adding customized modules that provide the required capabilities to produce the defined production grade slate and plant capacity in addition to the basic license agreement a range of services can also be provided including project assistance training assistance in starting up the plant and ongoing technical support after startup we may also offer marketing and sales services in addition licensees may continue to purchase polyolefin catalysts that are consumed in the production process generally under longterm catalyst supply agreements with us 

research and development 

our research and development “rd” activities are designed to improve our existing products and processes and discover and commercialize new materials catalysts and processes these activities focus on product and application development process development catalyst development and fundamental polyolefinfocused research 

in 2019 2018 and 2017 our rd expenditures were 111 million  115 million and 106 million respectively a portion of these expenses are related to technical support and customer service and are allocated to the other business segments in 2019 approximately 50 of all rd costs were allocated to business segments other than technology while in 2018 and 2017 the allocation approximated 45  

general 

intellectual property 

we maintain an extensive patent portfolio and continue to file new patent applications in the us and other countries as of december 31 2019 we owned over 6000 patents and patent applications worldwide our patents and trade secrets cover our processes products and catalysts and are significant to our competitive position particularly with regard to po intermediate chemicals petrochemicals polymers and our process technologies we own globally registered and unregistered trademarks including marks for “lyondellbasell” “lyondell” “basell” “equistar” and “a schulman” while we believe that our intellectual property provides competitive advantages we do not regard our businesses as being materially dependent upon any single patent trade secret or trademark some of our production capacity operates under licenses from third parties 

environmental 

most of our operations are affected by national state regional and local environmental laws matters pertaining to the environment are discussed in part i item 1a risk factors  part i item 3 legal proceedings  part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation s and notes 2 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

we have made and intend to continue to make the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to environmental health and safety matters we incurred capital expenditures of 195 million in 2019 for health safety and environmental compliance purposes and improvement programs and estimate such expenditures to be approximately 275 million in 2020 and 290 million in 2021 

while capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance including compliance with potential legislation and potential regulation related to climate change cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe they will have a material effect on our competitive position 

while there can be no assurance that physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future we do not believe these risks are material in the near term 

employee relations 

as of december 31 2019 we employed approximately 19100 fulltime and parttime employees around the world of this total 8900 were located in north america and another 8200 were located in europe the remainder of our employees are in other global locations 

as of december 31 2019 approximately 900 of our employees in north america were represented by labor unions the vast majority of our employees in europe and south america are subject to staff council or works council coverage or collective bargaining agreements 

in addition to our own employees we use the services of contractors in the routine conduct of our businesses

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 

our business including our results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected by safety or product liability issues 

failure to appropriately manage safety human health product liability and environmental risks associated with our products product life cycles and production processes could adversely impact employees communities stakeholders our reputation and our results of operations public perception of the risks associated with our products and production processes could impact product acceptance and influence the regulatory environment in which we operate while we have procedures and controls to manage safety risks issues could be created by events outside of our control including natural disasters severe weather events and acts of sabotage 

the cyclicality and volatility of the industries in which we participate may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 

our business operations are subject to the cyclical and volatile nature of the supplydemand balance in the chemical and refining industries our future operating results are expected to continue to be affected by this cyclicality and volatility the chemical and refining industries historically have experienced alternating periods of capacity shortages causing prices and profit margins to increase followed by periods of excess capacity resulting in oversupply declining capacity utilization rates and declining prices and profit margins 

in addition to changes in the supply and demand for products changes in energy prices and other worldwide economic conditions can cause volatility these factors result in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over business cycles 

new capacity additions in asia the middle east and north america may lead to periods of oversupply and lower profitability a sizable number of expansions have recently started up in north america the timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions are uncertain and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time as a consequence we are unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of future industry cycles or their effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our operations are subject to risks inherent in chemical and refining businesses and we could be subject to liabilities for which we are not fully insured or that are not otherwise mitigated 

we maintain property business interruption product general liability casualty and other types of insurance that we believe are appropriate for our business and operations as well as in line with industry practices however we are not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to our business including losses resulting from natural disasters wars or terrorist acts changes in insurance market conditions have caused and may in the future cause premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies to increase substantially and in some instances for certain insurance to become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured we might not be able to finance the amount of the uninsured liability on terms acceptable to us or at all and might be obligated to divert a significant portion of our cash flow from normal business operations 

further because a part of our business involves licensing polyolefin process technology our licensees are exposed to similar risks involved in the manufacture and marketing of polyolefins hazardous incidents involving our licensees if they do result or are perceived to result from use of our technologies may harm our reputation threaten our relationships with other licensees andor lead to customer attrition and financial losses our policy of covering these risks through contractual limitations of liability and indemnities and through insurance may not always be 

effective as a result our financial condition and results of operation would be adversely affected and other companies with competing technologies may have the opportunity to secure a competitive advantage 

a sustained decrease in the price of crude oil may adversely impact the results of our operations primarily in north america 

energy costs generally follow price trends of crude oil and natural gas these price trends may be highly volatile and cyclical in the past raw material and energy costs have experienced significant fluctuations that adversely affected our business segments’ results of operations for example we have benefited from the favorable ratio of us crude oil prices to natural gas prices in recent years if the price of crude oil remains lower relative to us natural gas prices or if the demand for natural gas and ngls increases this may have a negative impact on our results of operations 

costs and limitations on supply of raw materials and energy may result in increased operating expenses 

the costs of raw materials and energy represent a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to the significant competition we face and the commodity nature of many of our products we are not always able to pass on raw material and energy cost increases to our customers when we do have the ability to pass on the cost increases we are not always able to do so quickly enough to avoid adverse impacts on our results of operations 

cost increases for raw materials also may increase working capital needs which could reduce our liquidity and cash flow even if we increase our sales prices to reflect rising raw material and energy costs demand for products may decrease as customers reduce their consumption or use substitute products which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition producers in natural gas costadvantaged regions such as the middle east and north america benefit from the lower prices of natural gas and ngls competition from producers in these regions may cause us to reduce exports from europe and elsewhere any such reductions may increase competition for product sales within europe and other markets which can result in lower margins in those regions 

for some of our raw materials and utilities there are a limited number of suppliers and in some cases the supplies are specific to the particular geographic region in which a facility is located it is also common in the chemical and refining industries for a facility to have a sole dedicated source for its utilities such as steam electricity and gas having a sole or limited number of suppliers may limit our negotiating power particularly in the case of rising raw material costs any new supply agreements we enter into may not have terms as favorable as those contained in our current supply agreements 

additionally there is growing concern over the reliability of water sources including around the texas gulf coast where several of our facilities are located the decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of population growth drought or regulation could negatively impact our operations including by impacting our ability to produce or transport our products 

if our raw material or utility supplies were disrupted our businesses may incur increased costs to procure alternative supplies or incur excessive downtime which would have a negative impact on plant operations disruptions of supplies may occur as a result of transportation issues resulting from natural disasters water levels and interruptions in marine water routes among other causes that can affect the operations of vessels barges rails trucks and pipeline traffic these risks are particularly prevalent in the us gulf coast area additionally increasing exports of ngls and crude oil from the us or greater restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could restrict the availability of our raw materials thereby increasing our costs 

with increased volatility in raw material costs our suppliers could impose more onerous terms on us resulting in shorter payment cycles and increasing our working capital requirements 

our ability to source raw materials may be adversely affected by political instability civil disturbances or other governmental actions 

we obtain a portion of our principal raw materials from sources in the middle east and central and south america that may be less politically stable than other areas in which we conduct business such as the us or europe political instability civil disturbances and actions by governments in these areas are more likely to substantially increase the price and decrease the supply of raw materials necessary for our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

increased incidents of civil unrest including terrorist attacks and demonstrations that have been marked by violence have occurred in a number of countries in the middle east and south america some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest political instability and civil unrest could continue to spread in the region and involve other areas such unrest if it continues to spread or grow in intensity could lead to civil wars regional conflicts or regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to countries in which we conduct substantial business such as in the us europe or their respective trading partners 

economic disruptions and downturns in general and particularly continued global economic uncertainty or economic turmoil in emerging markets could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

our results of operations can be materially affected by adverse conditions in the financial markets and depressed economic conditions generally economic downturns in the businesses and geographic areas in which we sell our products could substantially reduce demand for our products and result in decreased sales volumes and increased credit risk recessionary environments adversely affect our business because demand for our products is reduced particularly from our customers in industrial markets generally and the automotive and housing industries specifically and may result in higher costs of capital a significant portion of our revenues and earnings are derived from our business in europe including southern europe in addition most of our european transactions and assets including cash reserves and receivables are denominated in euros 

we also derive significant revenues from our business in emerging markets particularly the emerging markets in asia and south america any broadbased downturn in these emerging markets or in a key market such as china could require us to reduce export volumes into these markets and could also require us to divert product sales to less profitable markets any of these conditions could ultimately harm our overall business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we sell products in highly competitive global markets and face significant price pressures 

we sell our products in highly competitive global markets due to the commodity nature of many of our products competition in these markets is based primarily on price and to a lesser extent on product performance product quality product deliverability reliability of supply and customer service often we are not able to protect our market position for these products by product differentiation and may not be able to pass on cost increases to our customers due to the significant competition in our business 

in addition we face increased competition from companies that may have greater financial resources and different cost structures or strategic goals than us these include large integrated oil companies some of which also have chemical businesses governmentowned businesses and companies that receive subsidies or other government incentives to produce certain products in a specified geographic region continuing competition from these companies especially in our olefin and refining businesses could limit our ability to increase product sales prices in response to raw material and other cost increases or could cause us to reduce product sales prices to compete effectively which would reduce our profitability competitors with different cost structures or strategic goals than we have may be able to invest significant capital into their businesses including expenditures for research and development in addition specialty products we produce may become commoditized over time increased competition could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 

interruptions of operations at our facilities may result in increased liabilities or lower operating results 

we own and operate largescale facilities our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our various production facilities and the ability to complete construction and maintenance projects on schedule interruptions at our facilities may materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or our business as a whole during and after the period of such operational difficulties in the past we have had to shut down plants on the us gulf coast including the temporary shutdown of a portion of our houston refinery as a result of hurricanes striking the texas coast in addition because the houston refinery is our only refining operation an outage at the refinery could have a particularly negative impact on our operating results as we do not have the ability to increase refining production elsewhere 

although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions our operations are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and refining and the related storage and transportation of raw materials products and wastes these potential hazards include 

 some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or personal injury and loss of life and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date negatively impacting project returns if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering procurement and construction of facilities could materially adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well 

as affect our ability to contract with our customers and supply certain products we produce such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors many of which are beyond our control including 

 any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects if we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs or if market conditions change it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increased it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products facilities and services 

increased global information security threats and more sophisticated targeted computer crime pose a risk to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data operations and infrastructure while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including security measures employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our employees systems networks products facilities and services remain potentially vulnerable to sophisticated espionage or cyberassault depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations 

we operate internationally and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations exchange controls political risks and other risks relating to international operations 

we operate internationally and are subject to the risks of doing business on a global level these risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates economic instability and disruptions restrictions on the transfer of funds and the imposition of trade restrictions or duties and tariffs and increasingly complex regulations concerning privacy and data security additional risks from our multinational business include transportation delays and interruptions war terrorist activities epidemics pandemics political instability import and export controls sanctions changes in governmental policies labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments 

we generate revenues from export sales and operations that may be denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency exchange rates between these currencies and functional currencies in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future it is possible that fluctuations in exchange rates will result in reduced operating results additionally we operate with the objective of having our worldwide cash available in the locations where it is needed including the united kingdom for our parent company’s significant cash obligations as a result of dividend and interest payments it is possible that we may not always be able to provide cash to other jurisdictions when needed or that such transfers of cash could be subject to additional taxes including withholding taxes 

our operating results could be negatively affected by the laws rules and regulations as well as political environments in the jurisdictions in which we operate there could be reduced demand for our products decreases in the prices at which we can sell our products and disruptions of production or other operations trade protection measures such as quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures or antidumping duties imposed in the countries in which we operate could negatively impact our business additionally there may be substantial capital and other 

costs to comply with regulations andor increased security costs or insurance premiums any of which could reduce our operating results 

we obtain a portion of our principal raw materials from international sources that are subject to these same risks our compliance with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject could be challenged furthermore these laws may be modified the result of which may be to prevent or limit subsidiaries from transferring cash to us 

furthermore we are subject to certain existing and may be subject to possible future laws that limit or may limit our activities while some of our competitors may not be subject to such laws which may adversely affect our competitiveness 

changes in tax laws and regulations could affect our tax rate and our results of operations 

we are a tax resident in the united kingdom and are subject to the united kingdom corporate income tax system lyondellbasell industries nv has little or no taxable income of its own because as a holding company it does not conduct any operations through our subsidiaries we have substantial operations worldwide taxes are primarily paid on the earnings generated in various jurisdictions including the us the netherlands germany france and italy 

we closely monitor tax law changes and the potential impact to our results of operations there continues to be increased attention to the tax practices of multinational companies including certain provisions of hr1 also known as the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the european union’s state aid investigations proposals by the organization for economic cooperation and development with respect to base erosion and profit shifting and european union tax directives and their implementation management does not believe that recent changes in income tax laws will have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations although new or proposed changes to tax laws could affect our tax liabilities in the future 

many of our businesses depend on our intellectual property our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and our inability to do so could reduce our ability to maintain our competitiveness and margins 

we have a significant worldwide patent portfolio of issued and pending patents these patents and patent applications together with proprietary technical knowhow are significant to our competitive position particularly with regard to po intermediate chemicals polyolefins licensing and catalysts we rely on the patent copyright and trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing we operate plants sell catalysts and products participate in joint ventures and license our process technology in many foreign jurisdictions including those having heightened risks for intellectual property in some of these instances we must disclose at least a portion of our technology to third parties or regulatory bodies in these cases we rely primarily on contracts and trade secret laws to protect the associated trade secrets however we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without authorization proceedings to protect these rights could be costly and we may not prevail 

the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes apparatuses technology trade secrets or proprietary knowhow could result in significantly lower revenues reduced profit margins and cash flows andor loss of market share we also may be subject to claims that our technology patents or other intellectual property infringes on a third party’s intellectual property rights unfavorable resolution of these claims could result in restrictions on our ability to deliver the related service or in a settlement that could be material to us 

shared control or lack of control of joint ventures may delay decisions or actions regarding our joint ventures 

a portion of our operations are conducted through joint ventures where control may be exercised by or shared with unaffiliated third parties we cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners including any nonperformance 

default or bankruptcy of joint venture partners the joint ventures that we do not control may also lack financial reporting systems to provide adequate and timely information for our reporting purposes 

our joint venture partners may have different interests or goals than we do and may take actions contrary to our requests policies or objectives differences in views among the joint venture participants also may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major matters potentially adversely affecting the business and operations of the joint ventures and in turn our business and operations we may develop a dispute with any of our partners over decisions affecting the venture that may result in litigation arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution if a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interest it could harm our brand business results of operations and financial condition 

we cannot predict with certainty the extent of future costs under environmental health and safety and other laws and regulations and cannot guarantee they will not be material 

we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture handle or own in addition because our products are components of a variety of other enduse products we along with other members of the chemical industry are subject to potential claims related to those enduse products any substantial increase in the success of these types of claims could negatively affect our operating results 

we are subject to extensive national regional state and local environmental laws regulations directives rules and ordinances concerning 

 many of these laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations in addition some of these laws and regulations require us to meet specific financial responsibility requirements any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

although we have compliance programs and other processes intended to ensure compliance with all such regulations we are subject to the risk that our compliance with such regulations could be challenged noncompliance with certain of these regulations could result in the incurrence of additional costs penalties or assessments that could be material 

our industry is subject to extensive government regulation and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures 

compliance with regulatory requirements will result in higher operating costs such as regulatory requirements relating to emissions the security of our facilities and the transportation export or registration of our products we generally expect that regulatory controls worldwide will become increasingly more demanding but cannot accurately predict future developments 

increasingly strict environmental laws and inspection and enforcement policies could affect the handling manufacture use emission or disposal of products other materials or hazardous and nonhazardous waste stricter environmental safety and health laws regulations and enforcement policies could result in increased operating costs or capital expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations additionally we are required to have permits for our businesses and are subject to licensing regulations these permits and licenses are subject to renewal 

modification and in some circumstances revocation further the permits and licenses are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

we may incur substantial costs to comply with climate change legislation and related regulatory initiatives 

there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated international national and state laws focusing on greenhouse gas “ghg” reduction these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future laws and regulations in this field continue to evolve and while they are likely to be increasingly widespread and stringent at this stage it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation under the 2015 paris agreement parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change agreed to undertake ambitious efforts to reduce ghg emissions and strengthen adaptation to the effects of climate change while the us notified the united nations in august 2017 that it will be withdrawing from the agreement other regions in which we operate including in particular the european union are preparing national legislation and protection plans to implement their emission reduction commitments under the agreement furthermore the european union is considering accelerating its own commitments and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 these actions could result in increased cost of purchased energy and increased costs of compliance for impacted locations 

within the framework of the eu emissions trading scheme “ets” we were allocated certain allowances of carbon dioxide for the affected plants of our european sites for the period from 2008 to 2012 “ets ii period” the ets ii period did not bring additional cost to us as the allowance allocation was sufficient to cover the actual emissions of the affected plants we were able to build an allowance surplus during the ets ii period which was banked to the scheme for the period from 2013 to 2020 “ets iii period” we have incurred additional costs for the ets iii period despite the allowance surplus accrued over the ets ii period as allowance allocations were reduced for the ets iii period and more of our plants are affected by the scheme we expect to incur additional costs in relation to future carbon or ghg emission trading schemes 

in the us the epa has promulgated federal ghg regulations under the clean air act affecting certain sources the epa has issued mandatory ghg reporting requirements requirements to obtain ghg permits for certain industrial plants and ghg performance standards for some facilities although the epa recently proposed to repeal and replace certain ghg requirements additional ghg regulation may be forthcoming at the us federal or state level that could result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances 

compliance with these or other changes in laws regulations and obligations that create a ghg emissions trading scheme or ghg reduction policies generally could significantly increase our costs or reduce demand for products we produce additionally compliance with these regulations may result in increased permitting necessary for the operation of our business or for any of our growth plans difficulties in obtaining such permits could have an adverse effect on our future growth therefore any future potential regulations and legislation could result in increased compliance costs additional operating restrictions or delays in implementing growth projects or other capital investments and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition climate changes such as drought conditions or increased frequency and severity of hurricanes and floods could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations  

we may be required to record material charges against our earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets 

we may be required to reduce production or idle facilities for extended periods of time or exit certain businesses as a result of the cyclical nature of our industry specifically oversupplies of or lack of demand for particular products or high raw material prices may cause us to reduce production we may choose to reduce production at certain facilities because we have offtake arrangements at other facilities which make any reductions or idling unavailable at those facilities any decision to permanently close facilities or exit a business likely would result in impairment and other charges to earnings 

temporary outages at our facilities can last for several quarters and sometimes longer these outages could cause us to incur significant costs including the expenses of maintaining and restarting these facilities in addition even though we may reduce production at facilities we may be required to continue to purchase or pay for utilities or raw materials under takeorpay supply agreements 

increased regulation or deselection of plastic could lead to a decrease in demand growth for some of our products   

in 2018 the european union adopted a strategy for plastics in a circular economy that aims to increase significantly the recycling of plastic and target the plastic products most often found on beaches and in seas in addition local and other governments have increasingly proposed or implemented bans on plastic items such as disposable bags and straws as well as other food packaging additionally plastics have recently faced increased public backlash and scrutiny increased regulation of or prohibition on the use of plastics could increase the costs incurred by our customers to use such products or otherwise limit the use of these products and could lead to a decrease in demand for pe pp and other products we make such a decrease in demand could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our business is capital intensive and we rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and ongoing capital needs limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results 

we require significant capital to operate our current business and fund our growth strategy moreover interest payments dividends and the expansion of our business or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital we believe that our cash from operations currently will be sufficient to meet these needs however if we need external financing our access to credit markets and pricing of our capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies and the state of the capital markets generally there can be no assurances that we would be able to incur indebtedness on terms we deem acceptable and it is possible that the cost of any financings could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities which could adversely affect our operating results 

we may use our 25 billion revolving credit facility which backs our commercial paper program to meet our cash needs to the extent available as of december 31 2019  we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the facility and 262 million  net of discount outstanding under our commercial paper program leaving an unused and available credit capacity of 2229 million  we may also meet our cash needs by selling receivables under our 900 million us receivables facility as of december 31 2019 subject to a borrowing base of eligible receivables we had availability of 690 million under this facility in the event of a default under our credit facility or any of our senior notes we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do any default under any of our credit arrangements could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate 

legislation and regulatory initiatives could lead to a decrease in demand for our products 

new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health safety and the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products initiatives by governments and private interest groups will potentially require increased toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us for example in the united states the national toxicology program “ntp” is a federal interagency program that seeks to identify and select for study chemicals and other substances to evaluate potential human health hazards in the european union the regulation on registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals “reach” is regulation 

designed to identify the intrinsic properties of chemical substances assess hazards and risks of the substances and identify and implement the risk management measures to protect humans and the environment 

assessments under ntp reach or similar programs or regulations in other jurisdictions may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals we use or produce and may result in additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of those chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

adverse results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us 

we are subject to and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty irrespective of its merits litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expenditure and diversion of management attention we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations should we fail to prevail in certain matters 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may adversely affect the valuation of pension obligations the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rates used to measure pension obligations the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets may result in corresponding increases and decreases in the value of plan assets particularly equity securities or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets any changes in key actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate or mortality rate would impact the valuation of pension obligations affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years 

nearly all of our current pension plans have projected benefit obligations that exceed the fair value of the plan assets as of december 31 2019 the aggregate deficit was 1287 million  any declines in the fair values of the pension plans’ assets could require additional payments by us in order to maintain specified funding levels 

our pension plans are subject to legislative and regulatory requirements of applicable jurisdictions which could include under certain circumstances local governmental authority to terminate the plan 

integration of acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions in order to enhance our business acquisitions involve numerous risks including meeting our standards for compliance problems combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs and liabilities diversion of management’s attention from our core businesses and potential loss of key employees 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to integrate successfully any businesses products technologies or personnel that we might acquire the integration of businesses that we may acquire is likely to be a complex timeconsuming and expensive process and we may not realize the anticipated revenues synergies or other benefits associated with our acquisitions if we do not manage and operate the acquired business up to our expectations if we are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems operating procedures financial controls and human resources practices our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected

 item 3 legal proceedings 

environmental matters 

from time to time we and our joint ventures receive notices or inquiries from government entities regarding alleged violations of environmental laws and regulations pertaining to among other things the disposal emission and storage of chemical and petroleum substances including hazardous wastes item 103 of the sec’s regulation sk requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and the proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that we reasonably believe could exceed 100000 the matters below are disclosed solely pursuant to that requirement 

in september 2013 the environmental protection agency “epa” region v issued a notice and finding of violation alleging violations at our morris illinois facility related to flaring activity the notice generally alleges failures to monitor steam usage and improper flare operations we reasonably believe that epa region v may assert a penalty demand in excess of 100000 

the epa has been conducting an enforcement initiative regarding flare emissions at petrochemical plants in july 2014 we received a clean air act section 114 information request regarding flares at four us facilities in response to the information we provided and subsequent discussions the epa and department of justice the “doj” have indicated that they are seeking a consent decree that would require certain corrective measures we reasonably believe that resolution of this matter will involve payment of a monetary sanction in excess of 100000 we continue to work with the epa and doj to resolve this matter 

in march 2018 the cologne germany local court issued a regulatory fine notice of €1800000 arising from a pipeline leak near our wesseling germany facility we expect the cologne prosecutor to issue a corresponding payment request which will resolve the matter 

in september 2019 the illinois environmental protection agency referred three emission events that occurred at our tuscoal facility in august and september 2018 to the illinois attorney generals office “iag” for enforcement in october 2019 iag made a 225000 civil penalty demand the parties are currently engaged in settlement discussions 

in november 2019 the channelview facility received a proposed agreed order from the texas commission on environmental quality alleging violations of leak detection and repair requirements and assessing an administrative penalty in the amount of 279336 we are currently engaged in discussions with the commission to resolve this matter

the discussion summarizing the significant factors affecting the results of operations and financial condition for the year ended december 31 2017 can be found in part ii “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018 which was filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 21 2019  of which item 7 is incorporated herein by reference 

overview 

during 2019 lyondellbasell continued to exhibit strong cash generation and remained committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy over each of the past six years we have consistently delivered 5 billion to 6 billion in cash from operating activities we affirmed our commitment to a strong and progressive dividend during 2019 by increasing our quarterly dividend for the eleventh time and returning a total of 52 billion in dividends and share repurchases to shareholders our businesses benefited from abundant and lowcost natural gas liquid feedstocks throughout the year and we demonstrated our capability to derive value from mergers and acquisitions through the integration of the a schulman acquisition 

during the fourth quarter margins within most of our businesses were impacted by slow industrial demand and typical seasonality refining margins improved on a higher maya 211 crack spread and relatively strong prices for naphtha and coke our technology segment achieved record licensing revenues contributing to the most profitable year in the company’s history for the segment 

in 2019 we developed opportunities to expand into new markets by leveraging our technologies to strengthen our position in asia in june we announced new polypropylene capacity through our thailand joint venture hmc polymers in september we signed a joint venture memorandum of understanding “mou” with liaoning bora enterprise group to build an integrated cracker and polyolefins project expanding our footprint in the rapidly growing chinese market recently we announced our intention to expand our existing partnership with sinopec to build a second propylene oxide and styrene monomer plant in china utilizing our advantaged technology 

significant items that affected results in 2019 relative to 2018 include 



other noteworthy items in 2019 include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

results of operations for the periods discussed are presented in the table below 



results of operations 

revenues —revenues decreased 4277 million  or 11  in 2019 compared to 2018  average sales prices were lower for most of our products as sales prices generally correlate with crude oil prices which decreased relative to 2018 these lower prices led to a revenue decrease of 10 in 2019 lower sales volumes resulted in a revenue decrease of 2 relative to 2018 unfavorable foreign exchange impacts in 2019 resulted in a revenue decrease of 2 relative to the prior period these decreases were partially offset by the acquired operations of a schulman which contributed an additional 3 or 1304 million  of revenues in 2019 compared to 2018 

cost of sales —cost of sales decreased 3228 million  or 10  in 2019 compared to 2018  this decrease in cost of sales is primarily due to lower feedstock and energy costs costs for crude oil heavy liquid feedstocks and natural gas liquids “ngls” and other feedstocks were lower in 2019 relative to 2018  this decrease corresponds with the decrease in revenues as discussed above 

fluctuations in our cost of sales are generally driven by changes in feedstock and energy costs feedstock and energy related costs generally represent approximately 75 to 80 of cost of sales other variable costs account for approximately 10 of cost of sales on an annual basis and fixed operating costs consisting primarily of expenses associated with employee compensation depreciation and amortization and maintenance range from approximately 10 to 15 in each annual period 

in 2019 our op—americas segment and aps segment recognized lower of cost or market “lcm” inventory valuation charges of 25 million and 8 million  respectively primarily due to a decline in domestic polyethylene prices cost of sales also includes 23 million related to a schulman integration costs incurred during 2019 

depreciation and amortization increased 71 million or 6 in 2019 compared to 2018 this increase is primarily due to the addition of a schulman assets acquired in august 2018 in 2020 we estimate depreciation and amortization charges will increase approximately 15 due to the completion of various capital projects including our hyperzone project 

sga expense —selling general and administrative “sga” expenses increased 70 million in 2019 compared to 2018 higher sga costs related to operating the a schulman assets acquired in august 2018 for a full year which resulted in a 115 million  or 10 increase additionally integration costs increased by 20 million compared to 2018 these increased costs were partially offset by a 5 decline in evaluation and preproject planning costs of certain growth projects and a 2 decline in employeerelated expenses relative to 2018 

operating income —operating income decreased 1115 million in 2019 compared to 2018  operating income for our op—americas id refining aps and op—eai segments declined by 474 million  467 million  212 million  39 million and 9 million  respectively relative to 2018 these decreases were partially offset by an increase in operating income in our technology segment of 90 million  operating results for each of our business segments are reviewed further in the “segment analysis” section below 

other income net —other income net decreased 67 million in 2019 compared to 2018  which included a 36 million gain on the sale of our carbon black subsidiary in france in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and pension and other postretirement benefits decreased other income by 15 million and 13 million respectively relative to 2018 

income from equity investments —our income from equity investments decreased 64 million in 2019 primarily due to reduced polyolefin spreads for our joint ventures in our op—eai segment 

income taxes— our effective income tax rates of 160 in 2019 and 115 in 2018 resulted in tax provisions of 648 million and 613 million  respectively 

we monitor tax law changes and the potential impact to our results of operations there continues to be increased attention to the tax practices of multinational companies including certain provisions of hr1 also known as the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the european union’s state aid investigations proposals by the organization for economic cooperation and development with respect to base erosion and profit shifting and european union tax directives and their implementation management does not believe that recent changes in income tax laws other than those disclosed and reflected in our financial statements will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements although new or proposed changes to tax laws could affect our tax liabilities in the future 

our effective income tax rate fluctuates based on among other factors changes in pretax income in countries with varying statutory tax rates the us domestic production activity deduction that applied to periods prior to 2018 changes in valuation allowances changes in foreign exchange gainslosses the amount of exempt income and changes in unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions 

our exempt income primarily includes interest income export incentives and equity earnings of our joint ventures interest income earned by certain of our european subsidiaries through intercompany financings is either untaxed or taxed at rates substantially lower than the us statutory rate export incentives relate to tax benefits derived from elections and structures available for us exports equity earnings attributable to the earnings of our joint ventures when paid through dividends to certain european subsidiaries are exempt from all or portions of normal statutory income tax rates we currently anticipate the favorable treatment for interest income dividends and export incentives to continue in the near term however this treatment is based on current law and tax rulings which could change including changes with respect to proposed treasury regulations under the tax act if finalized foreign exchange gainslosses have a permanent impact on our effective income tax rate that can cause unpredictable movement in our effective income tax rate we continue to maintain valuation allowances in various jurisdictions totaling 85 million as of 2019 which could impact our effective income tax rate in the future we believe our effective income tax rate for 2020 will be approximately 20 

the 2019 effective income tax rate of 160  which was lower than the us statutory tax rate of 21 was favorably impacted by exempt income 45 a tax benefit related to a patent box ruling 16 a loss on the liquidation of an entity 13 and changes in unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions 10 these favorable items were partially offset by the effects of earnings in various countries notably in europe with higher statutory tax rates 16 and us state and local income taxes 07 

during 2019 we recognized a 113 million noncash benefit to our effective tax rate primarily as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitations this amount consists of the recognition of 100 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits and the release of 13 million of previously accrued interest 

the 2018 effective income tax rate of 115  which was lower than the us statutory tax rate of 21 was favorably impacted by changes in unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions 60 and exempt income 56 these favorable items were partially offset by the effects of earnings in various countries notably in europe with higher statutory tax rates 17 and us state and local income taxes 10 

during 2018 we entered into various audit settlements impacting specific uncertain tax positions these audit settlements resulted in a 358 million noncash benefit to our effective tax rate consisting of the recognition of 299 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a reduction for tax positions of prior years and the release of 59 million of previously accrued interest 

comprehensive income 

we had comprehensive income of 2976 million in 2019 and 4682 million in 2018  comprehensive income decreased by 1706 million in 2019 compared to 2018  primarily due to lower net income net unfavorable changes in defined pension and other postretirement benefits and net unfavorable impacts of financial derivative instruments primarily driven by periodic changes in benchmark interest rates these decreases were partially offset by net less unfavorable impacts of unrealized changes in foreign currency translation adjustments 

the predominant functional currency for our operations outside of the us is the euro relative to the us dollar the value of the euro decreased during 2019 resulting in net losses as reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income these net losses include pretax gains of 26 million in 2019  which represent the effective portion of our net investment hedges 

in 2019  the cumulative aftertax effect of our derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was a net loss of 132 million  the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro in 2019 and periodic changes in benchmark interest rates resulted in a pretax gain of 109 million related to our crosscurrency swaps a 40 million pretax loss related to our crosscurrency swaps was reclassified to other income net in 2019  in 2019  a pretax loss of 223 million related to forwardstarting interest rate swaps was driven by changes in benchmark interest rates the remaining change relates to our commodity cash flow hedges 

we recognized defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans pretax losses of 361 million in 2019 and pretax gains of 41 million in 2018  primarily due to the fluctuations in the discount rate assumption used in determining the net benefit liabilities for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding net actuarial losses 

segment analysis 

we use earnings before interest income taxes and depreciation and amortization “ebitda” as our measure of profitability for segment reporting purposes this measure of segment operating results is used by our chief operating decision maker to assess the performance of and allocate resources to our operating segments intersegment eliminations and items that are not directly related or allocated to business operations such as foreign exchange gains losses and components of pension and other postretirement benefit costs other than service cost are included in “other” for additional information related to our operating segments as well as a reconciliation of ebitda to its nearest generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” measure income from continuing operations before income taxes see note 22 to our consolidated financial statements 

our continuing operations are managed through six reportable segments op—americas op—eai id aps refining and technology results for our aps segment incorporates the businesses acquired from a schulman beginning august 21 2018 the following tables reflect selected financial information for our reportable segments 





olefins and polyolefins–americas segment 

overview —ebitda declined in 2019 relative to 2018 primarily due to lower polyethylene results partially offset by improved olefin results 

in calculating the impact of margin and volume on ebitda consistent with industry practice management offsets revenues and volumes related to ethylene coproducts against the cost to produce ethylene volume and price impacts of ethylene coproducts are reported in margin ethylene is a major building block of olefins and polyolefins and as such ethylene sales volumes and prices and our internal cost of ethylene production are included in management’s assessment of the segment’s performance 

ethylene raw materials —ethylene and its coproducts are produced from two major raw material groups 

 although prices of these raw materials are generally related to crude oil and natural gas prices during specific periods the relationships among these materials and benchmarks may vary significantly we have significant flexibility to vary the raw material mix and process conditions in our us olefins plants in order to maximize profitability as market prices for both feedstocks and products change 

strong supplies from the us shale gasoil boom resulted in ethane being a preferred feedstock in our us plants in 2019 ethane remained the preferred us feedstock for ethylene despite higher prices driven by increased demand from newlyconstructed us olefins units and supply constraints in the gulf coast ngl fractionation and pipeline systems in 2019 and 2018 we produced approximately 80 of our ethylene from ethane 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the op—americas segment including income from equity investments which is a component of ebitda 



revenues —revenues decreased by 1973 million  or 19  in 2019 compared to 2018  average olefins and polyethylene sales prices were lower in 2019 compared to 2018 due to increased market supply stemming from new industry capacity additions and to a lesser extent a lower oil price environment polypropylene sales prices decreased with declining propylene feedstock prices these lower sales prices were responsible for a revenue decrease of 18 in 2019 lower sales volumes driven mainly by planned downtime at our matagorda texas and clinton iowa facilities accompanied by softer demand also led to a revenue decrease of 1 in 2019 

ebitda —ebitda decreased by 460 million  or 17  in 2019 compared to 2018  polyethylene results declined resulting in a 27 decrease in ebitda driven by a 261 per ton reduction in price spreads over ethylene as a result of increased market supply an offsetting increase in olefin results increased ebitda by 8 as ethylene margins increased by approximately 75 per ton primarily due to lower feedstock costs partially offset by a lower propylene price the segment recognized lcm charges of 25 million in 2019 primarily due to a decline in domestic polyethylene prices 

planned maintenance during the first and second quarters of 2020 is expected to reduce ebitda by approximately 25 million and 30 million respectively in addition we expect additional capacity from our hyperzone polyethylene plant in 2020 

olefins and polyolefins–europe asia international segment 

overview — ebitda declined in 2019 compared to 2018 mainly as a result of lower combined polyolefin results lower income from equity investments and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts partially offset by higher olefin results 

in calculating the impact of margin and volume on ebitda consistent with industry practice management offsets revenues and volumes related to ethylene coproducts against the cost to produce ethylene volume and price impacts of ethylene coproducts are reported in margin ethylene is a major building block of our olefins and polyolefins and as such ethylene sales volumes and prices and our internal cost of ethylene production are included in management’s assessment of the segment’s performance 

ethylene raw materials —in europe heavy liquids are the primary raw materials for our ethylene production in 2019 and 2018  we continued to benefit by sourcing advantaged ngls as market opportunities arose 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the op—eai segment including income from equity investments which is a component of ebitda   



revenues —revenues in 2019 decreased by 1334 million  or 12  compared to 2018  average sales prices in 2019 were lower across most products as sales prices generally correlate with crude oil prices which on average decreased compared to 2018 these lower average sales prices were responsible for revenue decreases of 10 higher sales volumes in 2019 resulted in 2 higher revenue driven by an absence of planned maintenance compared to 2018 foreign exchange impacts on average were unfavorable and led to a revenue decrease of 4 in 2019 

ebitda —ebitda decreased by 101 million  or 9  in 2019 compared to 2018  decreased polyethylene results led to a 5 decrease in ebitda largely due to a decline in margins attributed to lower price spreads over ethylene of 35 per ton a decline in polypropylene results decreased ebitda by 4 as price spreads over propylene decreased 48 per ton joint venture equity income decreased largely due to reduced polyolefin spreads resulting in a 5 decrease in ebitda these decreases were partially offset by higher olefins results which led to a 5 increase of ebitda this increase was primarily due to increased volumes driven by improved reliability with planned and unplanned maintenance impacting 2018 results in addition unfavorable foreign exchange impacts reduced ebitda by 5 in 2019 

fourth quarter 2019 results decreased 147 million or 51 versus the third quarter 2019 this change was primarily driven by a decline in olefin results as ethylene margins decreased due to higher feedstock costs and a lower propylene price 

planned maintenance during the third and fourth quarters of 2020 is expected to reduce ebitda by approximately 15 million in each of the two quarters 

intermediates and derivatives segment 

overview— ebitda for our id segment was lower in 2019 compared to 2018  largely driven by margin and volume decreases primarily in our intermediate chemicals business 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the id segment including income from equity investments which is a component of ebitda 



revenues —revenues for 2019 decreased by  1754 million  or 18  compared to 2018 lower average sales prices in 2019 for most products which reflect the impacts of lower feedstock and energy costs were responsible for a revenue decrease of 12 compared to 2018 which benefited from an elevated level of planned and unplanned industry outages lower sales volumes resulted in a 4 decrease in revenues in 2019 foreign exchange impacts on average were unfavorable and led to a revenue decrease of 2 

ebitda —ebitda decreased by  454 million  or 23  in 2019 compared to 2018 decreased intermediate chemicals results led to an ebitda decrease of 25 this decrease was a result of lower margins across most businesses in particular styrene as demand weakened in 2019 lower propylene oxide and derivatives results decreased ebitda by 5 largely due to lower volumes as demand declined these declines in ebitda were partially offset by higher oxyfuels and related products results mainly due to improved margins driven by price improvements and lowcost butane resulting in a 8 increase in ebitda unfavorable foreign exchange impacts also reduced ebitda by an additional 2 in 2019 

in 2020 we have planned maintenance that is expected to reduce ebitda by approximately 10 million in each of the first and second quarters and 25 million in each of the third and fourth quarters 

advanced polymer solutions segment 

overview— ebitda for our aps segment increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the contribution of ebitda stemming from the august 2018 acquisition of a schulman partly offset by integration costs and lower volumes across most products 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the aps segment 

revenues —revenues increased in 2019 by 826 million  or 21  compared to 2018  excluding the impacts of the august 2018 acquisition of a schulman sales volumes declined in 2019 stemming from lower market demand for advanced polymer products including lower automotive and roofing demand which led to a 7 decrease in revenue in 2019 lower average sales prices as well as unfavorable foreign exchange impacts each resulted in a 4 decrease in revenue these declines were offset by 1304 million of additional revenues in the aps segment due to a full year of operating the a schulman assets in 2019 compared to a partial year in 2018 following the acquisition in august 2018 

ebitda —ebitda increased in 2019 by 24 million  or 6  compared to 2018  compounding and solutions results improved resulting in a 27 increase of ebitda this increase was largely due to an additional 108 million of ebitda contributed by the operations of a schulman in 2019 advanced polymers results reduced ebitda by 9 largely due to lower volumes driven by reduced automotive and roofing demand further transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of a schulman were 47 million higher in 2019 which reduced ebitda by 12 relative to 2018 unfavorable foreign exchange impacts also reduced ebitda by an additional 3 in 2019 

refining segment 

overview —ebitda for our refining segment decreased due to lower industry margins driven by a compressed maya differential lower gasoline crack spreads and lower byproduct margins compared to 2018 

the following table sets forth selected financial information and heavy crude processing rates for the refining segment and the us refining market margins for the applicable periods light louisiana sweet “lls” is a light crude oil while “maya” is a heavy crude oil 



revenues —revenues decreased by 906 million  or 10  in 2019 compared to 2018 lower product prices led to a revenue decrease of 7 relative to 2018 due to an average crude oil price decrease of approximately 6 per barrel in 2019 although heavy crude oil processing rates increased during 2019 overall sales volumes decreased driven by reduced rates on conversion units due to crude selection and the optimization of refinery operations this reduction in conversion rates resulted in a further revenue decrease of 3 during 2019 

ebitda —ebitda decreased by 232 million  or 139  in 2019 compared to 2018 lower refining margins resulted in a 200 decrease in ebitda relative to 2018 unusually low discounts for heavy sour crude oils on the us gulf coast led to a lower lighttoheavy crude price differential and compression in the benchmark maya 211 market margin this compression combined with the houston refinery’s configuration which limits the amount of light sweet crude that can be processed created a challenging market for our refining segment margins were further compressed by a negative byproduct impact largely driven by weakness in naphtha and refinery grade propylene this margindriven decrease in ebitda was partly offset by a 61 increase associated with the rise in heavy crude oil processing rates due to the completion of planned maintenance in 2018 

fourth quarter 2019 ebitda improved 106 million or 126 representing a significant improvement compared to the fourth quarter 2018 which experienced a loss of 84 million margin improvements resulted in a 76 increase in ebitda as the maya 211 crack spread increased by 855 per barrel to 1944 per barrel heavy crude oil processing rates increased by 83 thousand barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2019 due to the completion of planned maintenance in the second half of 2018 this volume driven improvement resulted in a 50 increase in ebitda in the fourth quarter of 2019 

we anticipate improvements in our refining results in 2020 associated with the global adoption of international maritime organization “imo” 2020 

technology segment 

overview —the technology segment recognizes revenues related to the sale of polyolefin catalysts and the licensing of chemical and polyolefin process technologies these revenues are offset in part by the costs incurred in the production of catalysts licensing and services activities and research and development “rd” activities in 2019 and 2018  our technology segment incurred approximately 50 and 55 respectively of all rd costs ebitda for our technology segment improved in 2019 compared to 2018 largely due to higher licensing revenues 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the technology segment 



revenues —revenues increased by 80 million  or 14  in 2019 compared to 2018  higher licensing revenues resulted in an increase of 18 in 2019 compared to 2018 increases in average catalyst sales prices resulted in revenue increases of 4 in 2019 lower catalyst sales volumes driven by the timing of customer orders resulted in a 3 decrease in revenue in 2019 foreign exchange impacts that on average were unfavorable led to a revenue decrease of 5 

ebitda —ebitda in 2019 increased by 83 million  or 25  compared to 2018  this increase was mainly driven by higher licensing revenues as several licensing agreements signed in 2018 primarily in china were recognized in revenue during 2019 

financial condition 

operating investing and financing activities of continuing operations which are discussed below are presented in the following table 

operating activities —cash of 4961 million generated by operating activities in 2019 reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items payments for employee bonuses income taxes and cash consumed by the main components of working capital–accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable a 113 million noncash reduction in unrecognized tax benefits is reflected in other operating activities in 2019 for additional information on this matter see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

in 2019 the main components of working capital consumed 13 million of cash driven by a decrease in accounts payable and an increase in inventories partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable the decrease in accounts payable was primarily driven by weaker demand in our aps segment and a decrease in certain raw material costs in our id segment the increase in inventories was a result of inventory builds as a result of planned and unplanned maintenance in our op—eai segment the decrease in accounts receivable was driven by decreases in our aps id and op—americas segments as a result of unfavorable market conditions 

cash of 5471 million generated by operating activities in 2018 reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items and net cash provided by the main components of working capital a 358 million noncash reduction in unrecognized tax benefits is reflected in other operating activities in 2018 for additional information on this matter see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

in 2018 the main components of working capital provided 93 million of cash lower accounts receivable due primarily to lower sales volumes in our op—americas op—eai and id segments at year end and higher accounts payable due to higher feedstock prices were partially offset by an increase in inventories primarily due to the lower sales volumes at year end 

investing activities —we invest cash in investmentgrade and other highquality instruments that provide adequate flexibility to redeploy funds as needed to meet our cash flow requirements while maximizing yield 

we received proceeds of 511 million and 423 million in 2019 and 2018 respectively upon the sale and maturity of certain of our availableforsale debt securities additionally in 2019 and 2018 we received proceeds of 332 million and 97 million  respectively on the sale of our investments in equity securities in 2019 we received proceeds of 527 million upon the maturity of certain of our repurchase agreements

in 2019 and 2018 our capital expenditures included construction related to our potba plant at our channelview texas facility and our hyperzone polyethylene plant at our la porte texas facility turnaround activities at several sites and other plant improvement projects the higher level of capital expenditures for our id segment in 2019 compared to 2018 is largely due to the construction of our potba plant 

in 2020 we expect to spend approximately 24 billion for capital expenditures and investment in our us and european po joint ventures the lower level of expected capital expenditures in 2020 relative to 2019 is primarily due to the reduction in spend related to our hyperzone polyethylene plant we will complete construction of our hyperzone project in early 2020 see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our us and european po joint ventures

contractual and other obligations —the following table summarizes as of december 31 2019  our future minimum payments for longterm debt including current maturities shortterm debt and contractual and other obligations 

  

total debt —our debt includes unsecured senior notes guaranteed notes and various other us and nonus loans see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of covenant requirements under our credit facilities and indentures and additional information regarding our debt facilities 

interest on total debt —our debt and related party debt agreements contain provisions for the payment of monthly quarterly or semiannual interest at a stated or variable rate of interest over the term of the debt interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the rate in effect as of december 31 2019 

pension and other postretirement benefits —we maintain several defined benefit pension plans as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements many of our us and nonus plans are subject to minimum funding requirements however the amounts of required future contributions for all our plans are not fixed and can vary significantly due to changes in economic assumptions liability experience and investment return on plan assets as a result we have excluded pension and other postretirement benefit obligations from the contractual and other obligations table above our annual contributions may include amounts in excess of minimum required funding levels contributions to our nonus plans in years beyond 2020 are not expected to be materially different than the expected 2020 contributions disclosed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2019  the projected benefit obligation for our pension plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by 1287 million  subject to future actuarial gains and losses as well as future asset earnings we together with our consolidated subsidiaries will be required to fund the discounted obligation of 1287 million in future years we contributed 97 million and 100 million to our pension plans in 2019 and 2018  respectively we provide other postretirement benefits primarily medical benefits to eligible participants as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements we pay other unfunded postretirement benefits as incurred 

contract liabilities —we are obligated to deliver products or services in connection with sales agreements under which customer payments were received before transfer of control to the customers occurs these contract liabilities will be recognized in earnings when control of the product or service is transferred to the customer which range from 1 to 20 years the longterm portion of such advances totaled 21 million as of december 31 2019  

other —other primarily consists of accruals for taxes and employeerelated expenses 

deferred income taxes —the scheduled settlement of the deferred tax liabilities shown in the table is based on the scheduled reversal of the underlying temporary differences actual cash tax payments will vary depending upon future taxable income see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our deferred tax liabilities 

purchase obligations —we are party to various obligations to purchase products and services principally for raw materials utilities and industrial gases these commitments are designed to ensure sources of supply and are not expected to be in excess of normal requirements the commitments are segregated into takeorpay contracts and other contracts under the takeorpay contracts we are obligated to make minimum payments whether or not we take the product or service other contracts include contracts that specify minimum quantities however in the event that we do not take the contractual minimum we are only obligated for any resulting economic loss suffered by the vendor the payments shown for the other contracts assume that minimum quantities are purchased for contracts with variable pricing terms the minimum payments reflect the contract price at december 31 2019  

operating leases —we lease various facilities and equipment under noncancelable lease arrangements for various periods see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for related lease disclosures 

current business outlook 

our foundations of operational excellence cost management and disciplined capital allocation continue to serve us well in the current challenging environment we anticipate typical seasonal improvements for our businesses as we progress through the second and third quarters of 2020 favorable resolution of trade policies and a rebound in industrial demand could provide significant upside for our industry we expect benefits from the imo 2020 regulations for our houston refinery and the completion of our new hyperzone project in 2020 

related party transactions 

we have related party transactions with our joint venture partners we believe that such transactions are effected on terms substantially no more or less favorable than those that would have been agreed upon by unrelated parties on an arm’s length basis see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional related party disclosures 

critical accounting policies 

management applies those accounting policies that it believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the us see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements our more critical accounting policies include those related to the valuation of inventories goodwill accruals for longterm employee benefit costs such as pension and other postretirement costs and accruals for taxes based on income inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management management periodically updates its estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment 

inventories —we account for our raw materials workinprogress and finished goods inventories using the lastin firstout “lifo” method of accounting 

the cost of raw materials which represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses and energy costs generally follow price trends for crude oil andor natural gas crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to many factors including changes in economic conditions 

since our inventory consists of manufactured products derived from crude oil natural gas natural gas liquids and correlated materials as well as the associated feedstocks and intermediate chemicals our inventory market values are generally influenced by changes in the benchmark of crude oil and heavy liquid values and prices for manufactured finished goods the degree of influence of a particular benchmark may vary from period to period as the composition of the dollar value lifo pools change due to natural inventory composition changes variation in pricing from period to period does not necessarily result in a linear lower of cost or market “lcm” impact 

additionally an lcm condition may arise due to a volumetric decline in a particular material that had previously provided a positive impact within a pool as a result market valuations and lcm conditions are dependent upon the composition and mix of materials on hand at the balance sheet date in the measurement of an lcm adjustment the numeric input value for determining the crude oil market price includes pricing that is weighted by volume of inventories held at a point in time including wti brent and maya crude oils 

as indicated above fluctuation in the prices of crude oil natural gas and correlated products from period to period may result in the recognition of charges to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in periods of falling prices and the reversal of those charges in subsequent interim periods as market prices recover accordingly our cost of sales and results of operations may be affected by such fluctuations 

during the fourth quarter of 2019 ebitda for our op—americas segment and aps segment results include a noncash lcm inventory valuation charges of 25 million and 8 million  respectively primarily due to a decline in domestic polyethylene prices 

goodwill —as of december 31 2019 we have goodwill of 1891 million  of this amount 1357 million is related to the acquisition of a schulman in 2018 which is included in our aps segment and is mainly attributed to acquired workforce and expected synergies the remaining goodwill at december 31 2019  primarily represents the tax effect of the differences between the tax and book bases of our assets and liabilities resulting from the revaluation of those assets and liabilities to fair value in connection with the company’s emergence from bankruptcy and freshstart accounting in 2010 additional information on the amount of goodwill allocated to our reporting units appears in note 8 and note 22 to the consolidated financial statements 

we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill of a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors assessed for each of the reporting units include but are not limited to changes in longterm commodity prices discount rates competitive environments planned capacity cost factors such as raw material prices and financial performance of the reporting units if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a quantitative test is required 

we also have the option to proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test under the quantitative impairment test the fair value of each reporting unit calculated using a discounted cash flow model is compared to its carrying value including goodwill the discounted cash flow model inherently utilizes a significant number of estimates and assumptions including operating margins tax rates discount rates capital expenditures and working capital changes if the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds its fair value an impairment charge equal to the excess would be recognized up to a maximum amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

for 2019 and 2018  management performed a qualitative impairment assessment of our reporting units which indicated that the fair value of our reporting units was more likely than not greater than their carrying value including goodwill accordingly a quantitative goodwill impairment test was not required and no goodwill impairment was recognized in 2019 or 2018  

longterm employee benefit costs —our costs for longterm employee benefits particularly pension and other postretirement medical and life insurance benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is management’s responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent its best estimates of the future effects of those uncertainties and to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors 

the current benefit service costs as well as the existing liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis the discount rate is a current rate related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled our assumed discount rate is based on yield information for highquality corporate bonds with durations comparable to the expected cash settlement of our obligations for the purpose of measuring the benefit obligations at december 31 2019  we used a weighted average discount rate of 316 for the us plans which reflects the different terms of the related benefit obligations the weighted average discount rate used to measure obligations for nonus plans at december 31 2019  was 103  reflecting market interest rates the discount rates in effect at december 31 2019  will be used to measure net periodic benefit cost during 2020  

the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of other postretirement medical benefits are also measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits as of december 31 2019  the assumed rate of increase for our us plans was 61  decreasing to 45 in 2038 and thereafter however changing the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point in each year would increase or decrease the accumulated other postretirement benefit liability as of december 31 2019  by 24 million and 15 million  respectively for nonus plans and by less than 1 million for us plans a one percentage point change would not have a material effect on the aggregate service and interest cost components of the net periodic other postretirement benefit cost for the year then ended 

the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense is affected by the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption investment returns that are recognized currently in net income represent the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets applied to a marketrelated value of plan assets which is defined as the market value of assets the expected rate of return on plan assets is a longerterm rate and is expected to change less frequently than the current assumed discount rate reflecting longterm market expectations rather than current fluctuations in market conditions 

the weighted average expected longterm rate of return on assets in our us plans of 750 is based on the average level of earnings that our independent pension investment advisor advised could be expected to be earned over time the weighted average expected longterm rate of return on assets in our nonus plans of 279 is based on expectations and asset allocations that vary by region the asset allocations are summarized in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets management’s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 

net periodic pension cost recognized each year includes the expected asset earnings rather than the actual earnings or loss along with other gains and losses this unrecognized amount to the extent it cumulatively exceeds 10 of the projected benefit obligation for the respective plan is recognized as additional net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service period of the participants in each plan 

the following table reflects the sensitivity of the benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans to changes in the actuarial assumptions 



the sensitivity of our postretirement benefit plans obligations and net periodic benefit costs to changes in actuarial assumptions are reflected in the following table 



additional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

accruals for taxes based on income —the determination of our provision for income taxes and the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities is subject to management’s estimates and judgments due to the complexity of the tax laws and regulations in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of these complex laws and regulations 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 

we recognize future tax benefits to the extent that the realization of these benefits is more likely than not our current provision for income taxes is impacted by the recognition and release of valuation allowances related to net deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions further changes to these valuation allowances may impact our future provision for income taxes which will include no tax benefit with respect to losses incurred and no tax expense with respect to income generated in these countries until the respective valuation allowance is eliminated 

we recognize the financial statement benefits with respect to an uncertain income tax position that we have taken or may take on an income tax return when we believe it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of lyondellbasell industries nv’s management of commodity price risk foreign currency exposure and interest rate risk through its use of derivative instruments and hedging activities 

commodity price risk 

our products and raw materials are subject to changes in market price as supply and demand fundamentals change natural gas crude oil and refined products along with feedstocks for ethylene and propylene production constitute the main commodity exposures we try to protect against such instability through various business strategies including provisions in sales contracts which allows us to pass on higher raw material costs to our customers through timely price increases and through the use of commodity swap and futures contracts 

we use value at risk “var” stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes var estimates the maximum potential loss in fair market values for our commodity derivative instruments given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time using specified confidence levels utilizing a monte carlo simulation with a 95 percent confidence level over a threeday time horizon the effect on our pretax income and cash flows for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 would be immaterial 

foreign exchange risk 

we manufacture and market our products in many countries throughout the world and as a result are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

a significant portion of our reporting entities use the euro as their functional currency our reporting currency is the us dollar the translation gains or losses that result from the process of translating the euro denominated financial statements to us dollars are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until such time as those entities may be liquidated or sold changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro can therefore have a significant impact on comprehensive income 

we have entered into hedging arrangements designated as net investment hedges to reduce the volatility in shareholders’ equity resulting from foreign currency fluctuation associated with our net investments in foreign operations the table below illustrates the impact on other comprehensive loss of a 10 fluctuation in the foreign currency rate associated with each net investment hedge and the euribor and libor rates associated with basis swaps as of december 31 2019 and 2018  



some of our operations enter into transactions that are not denominated in their functional currency this results in exposure to foreign currency risk for financial instruments including but not limited to third party and intercompany receivables and payables and intercompany loans 

we maintain risk management control practices to monitor the foreign currency risk attributable to our intercompany and third party outstanding foreign currency balances these practices involve the centralization of our 

exposure to underlying currencies that are not subject to central bank andor country specific restrictions by centralizing most of our foreign currency exposure into one subsidiary we are able to take advantage of any natural offsets thereby reducing the overall impact of changes in foreign currency rates on our earnings at december 31 2019 and 2018  a 10 fluctuation compared to the us dollar in the underlying currencies that have no central bank or other currency restrictions related to nonhedged monetary net assets would have had a resulting additional impact to earnings of approximately 2 million and 3 million respectively 

our policy is to maintain a balanced position in foreign currencies to minimize exchange gains and losses arising from changes in exchange rates to minimize the effects of our net currency exchange exposures we enter into foreign currency spot and forward contracts and in some cases crosscurrency swaps 

we also engage in shortterm foreign exchange swaps in order to roll certain hedge positions and to make funds available for intercompany financing our net position in foreign currencies is monitored daily 

we entered into 2300 million of noncancellable crosscurrency swaps which we designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges to reduce the variability in the functional currency equivalent cash flows of certain foreign currency denominated intercompany notes at december 31 2019  these foreign currency contracts have maturity dates ranging from 2021 to 2027 and their fair value was a net asset of 205 million a 10 fluctuation compared to the us dollar would have had a resulting additional impact to other comprehensive loss of approximately 238 million and 243 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively 

other income net in the consolidated statements of income reflected net exchange rate foreign currency gains of 9 million and 24 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively and foreign currency losses of 1 million in 2017  for forward contracts including swap transactions that economically hedge recognized monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies no hedge accounting is applied changes in the fair value of foreign currency forward and swap contracts are reported in the consolidated statements of income and offset the currency exchange results recognized on the assets and liabilities at december 31 2019  these foreign currency contracts which will mature between january 2020 and september 2020 inclusively had an aggregated notional amount of 780 million and the fair value was a net asset of 4 million a 10 fluctuation compared to the us dollar would have had a resulting additional impact to earnings of approximately 31 million and 96 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk management is viewed as a tradeoff between cost and risk the cost of interest is generally lower for shortterm debt and higher for longterm debt and lower for floating rate debt and higher for fixed rate debt however the risk associated with interest rates is inversely related to the cost with shortterm debt carrying a higher refinancing risk and floating rate debt having higher interest rate volatility our interest rate risk management strategy attempts to optimize this costriskreward tradeoff 

we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our fixed and variable rate debt fluctuations in interest rates impact the fair value of fixedrate debt as well as pretax earnings stemming from interest expense on variablerate debt to minimize earnings at risk as part of our interest rate risk management strategy we target to maintain floating rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps equal to our cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and triparty repurchase agreements as those assets are invested in floating rate instruments 

preissuance interest rate —a preissuance interest rate strategy is utilized to mitigate the risk that benchmark interest rates ie us treasury midswaps etc will increase between the time a decision has been made to issue debt and when the actual debt offering is issued at december 31 2019  the total notional amount of our interest rate contracts designated as cash flow hedges which have maturity dates ranging from 2020 to 2021 was 1500 million and the fair value was a net liability of 225 million we estimate that a 10 change in market interest rates as of december 31 2019 and 2018  would change the fair value of our forwardstarting interest rate swaps outstanding and would have had a resulting impact on other comprehensive loss of approximately 66 million and 71 million respectively 

fixedrate debt —we enter into interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy at december 31 2019  the total notional amount of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges which have maturity dates ranging from 2021 to 2027 was 2140 million and their fair value was a net asset of 41 million 

at december 31 2019  after giving consideration to the 2140 million of fixedrate debt that we have effectively converted to floating through these us dollar fixedforfloating interest rate swaps approximately 64 of our debt portfolio on a gross basis incurred interest at a fixedrate and the remaining 36 of the portfolio incurred interest at a variablerate we estimate that a 10 change in market interest rates as of december 31 2019 and 2018 would change the fair value of our interest rate swaps outstanding and would have had a resulting impact on our pretax income of approximately 15 million and 26 million respectively 

variablerate debt —our variable rate debt consists of our 2500 million senior revolving credit facility our 900 million us receivables facility and our commercial paper program at december 31 2019  there were no outstanding borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility nor our us receivables facility our commercial paper program had outstanding borrowings of 262 million at december 31 2019  based on our average variablerate debt outstanding per year we estimate that a 10 change in interest rates would have had a 1 million and 2 million impact on earnings in 2019 and 2018  respectively

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

overview 

lyondellbasell industries nv is a global independent chemical company and was incorporated under dutch law on october 15 2009 unless otherwise indicated the “company” “we” “our” “us” and “lyondellbasell” are used in this report to refer to the businesses of lyondellbasell industries nv and its consolidated subsidiaries we are one of the world’s top independent chemical companies based on revenues 

we participate globally across the petrochemical value chain and are an industry leader in many of our product lines our chemicals businesses consist primarily of large processing plants that convert large volumes of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon feedstocks into plastic resins and other chemicals our chemical products tend to be basic building blocks for other chemicals and plastics while our plastic products are used in large volumes as well as smaller specialty applications our customers use our plastics and chemicals to manufacture a wide range of products that people use in their everyday lives including food packaging home furnishings automotive components paints and coatings our refining business consists of our houston refinery which processes crude oil into refined products such as gasoline diesel and jet fuel we also develop and license chemical and polyolefin process technologies and manufacture and sell polyolefin catalysts 

our financial performance is influenced by the supply and demand for our products the cost and availability of feedstocks global and regional production capacity our operational efficiency and our ability to control costs we have a strong operational focus and as a producer of large volume commodities continuously strive to differentiate ourselves through safe reliable and lowcost operations in all our businesses we purchase large quantities of natural gas electricity and steam which we use as energy to fuel our facilities we also purchase large quantities of natural gas liquids and crude oil derivatives which we use as feedstocks during recent years the relatively low cost of natural gasderived raw materials in the us versus the global cost of crude oilderived raw materials has had a significant positive influence on the profitability of our north american operations while new facilities and increased supply has reduced the north american feedstock advantage improved product supply and demand fundamentals in several businesses notably global polyolefins products have partially offset the decline 

segments 

we manage our operations through six operating segments our reportable segments are 

 financial information about our business segments and geographical areas can be found in note 22  segment and related information  to the consolidated financial statements information about the locations where we produce our primary products 

can be found under “description of properties” no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues in 2018 2017 and 2016 

olefins and polyolefins segments generally 

we are one of the leading worldwide producers of olefins and polyethylene “pe” and we are the world’s second largest producer of polypropylene “pp” we manage our olefin and polyolefin business in two reportable segments op–americas and op–eai 

olefins  coproducts —ethylene is the most significant petrochemical in terms of worldwide production volume and is the key building block for pe and many other chemicals and plastics ethylene is produced by steam cracking hydrocarbons such as ethane propane butane and naphtha this production results in coproducts such as aromatics and other olefins including propylene and butadiene ethylene and its coproducts are fundamental to many parts of the economy including the production of consumer products packaging housing and automotive components and other durable and nondurable goods 

polyolefins —polyolefins such as pe and pp are polymers derived from olefins including ethylene and propylene polyolefins are the most widely used thermoplastics in the world and are found in applications and products that enhance the everyday quality of life our products are used in consumer automotive and industrial applications ranging from food and beverage packaging to housewares and construction materials 

polyethylene —we produce high density polyethylene “hdpe” low density polyethylene “ldpe” and linear low density polyethylene pe sales accounted for approximately 19 21 and 24 of our total revenues in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

polypropylene —we produce pp homopolymers and copolymers pp sales accounted for approximately 15 of our total revenues in 2018 and 17 in each of 2017 and 2016 

olefins and polyolefins – americas segment 

overview 

our op–americas segment produces and markets olefins and coproducts polyethylene and polypropylene 

sales  marketing  customers 

most of the ethylene we produce is consumed internally as a raw material in the production of pe and other derivatives with the balance sold to third party customers primarily under multiyear contracts in 2017 and 2018 we added a total of 230 million pounds of ethylene capacity at our facilities in north america 

we use all the propylene we produce in the production of pp propylene oxide and other derivatives of those products as a result we also purchase propylene from third parties in addition to purchases of propylene we purchase ethylene for resale when necessary to satisfy customer demand above our own production levels volumes of any of these products purchased for resale can vary significantly from period to period and are typically most significant during extended outages of our own production such as during planned maintenance however purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profits except to the extent that they replace lowercost production 

most of the ethylene and propylene production from our channelview corpus christi and la porte texas facilities is shipped via a pipeline system which has connections to numerous us gulf coast consumers this pipeline extends from corpus christi to mont belvieu texas in addition exchange agreements with other ethylene and coproducts producers allow access to customers who are not directly connected to this pipeline system some ethylene is shipped by railcar from our clinton iowa facility to our morris illinois facility and some is shipped directly to customers propylene from clinton and morris is generally shipped by marine vessel barge railcar or truck 

our pp and pe production is typically sold through our sales organization to an extensive base of established customers and distributors servicing both the domestic and export markets either under annual contracts or on a spot basis we have sales 

offices in various locations in north america and our polyolefins are primarily transported in north america by railcar or truck export sales are primarily to customers in latin america with sales to asia expected to increase in the coming years as global supply and demand balances shift we also consume pp in our pp compounds business which is managed worldwide by our aps segment 

joint venture relationships 

we participate in a joint venture in mexico which provides us with capacity for approximately 640 million pounds of pp production the capacity is based on our percentage ownership of the joint venture’s total capacity we do not hold a majority interest in or have operational control of this joint venture 

raw materials 

raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost to produce ethylene and its coproducts the primary raw materials used in our americas olefin facilities are natural gas liquids “ngls” and heavy liquids heavy liquids include crude oilbased naphtha and other refined products as well as condensate a very light crude oil resulting from natural gas production ngls include ethane propane and butane the use of heavy liquid raw materials results in the production of significant volumes of coproducts such as propylene butadiene and benzene as well as gasoline blending components while the use of ngls results in the production of a smaller volume of coproducts 

our ability to pass on raw material price increases to our customers is dependent on marketdriven demand for olefins and polyolefins sales prices for products sold in the spot market are determined by market forces our contract prices are influenced by product supply and demand conditions spot prices indices published in industry publications and in some instances cost recovery formulas 

we can manufacture olefins by utilizing a variety of feedstocks including heavy liquids and ngls technological advances for extracting shalebased oil and gas have led to an increased supply of ngls providing a cost advantage over heavy liquids particularly in the us a plant’s flexibility to consume a wide range of raw materials generally provides an advantage over plants that are restricted in their processing capabilities our americas’ facilities can process significant quantities of either heavy liquids or ngls we estimate that in the us we can produce up to approximately 90 of our total ethylene output using ngls changes in the raw material feedstock mix utilized in the production process will result in variances in production capacities among products we believe our raw material flexibility in the us is a key advantage in our production of ethylene and its coproducts 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to olefins and polyolefins competition is based on price and to a lesser extent on product quality product delivery reliability of supply product performance and customer service profitability is affected not only by supply and demand for olefins and polyolefins but also by raw material costs and price competition among producers which may intensify due to among other things the addition of new capacity in general demand is a function of worldwide demographic and economic growth including the regional dynamics that underlie global growth trends 

we compete in north america with other large marketers and producers including global chemical companies chemical divisions of large oil companies and regional marketers and producers 

based on published capacity data we believe as of december 31 2018 we were 



olefins and polyolefins – europe asia international segment 

overview 

our op–eai segment produces and markets olefins and coproducts polyethylene and polypropylene 

sales  marketing  customers 

our ethylene production is primarily consumed internally as a raw material in the production of polyolefins and we purchase additional ethylene as needed to meet our production needs our propylene production is used as a raw material in the production of pp and propylene oxide and derivatives of those products and we regularly purchase propylene from third parties because our internal needs exceed our internal production 

with respect to pp and pe our production is typically sold through our sales organization to an extensive base of established customers under annual contracts or on a spot basis and is also sold through distributors our polyolefins are primarily transported in europe by railcar or truck 

our regional sales offices are in various locations including the netherlands hong kong china india australia and the united arab emirates we also operate through a worldwide network of local sales and representative offices in europe asia and africa our joint ventures described below typically manage their domestic sales and marketing efforts independently and we typically operate as their agentdistributor for all or a portion of their exports

we participate in several manufacturing joint ventures in saudi arabia thailand poland australia and south korea we do not hold majority interests in any of these joint ventures nor do we have operational control these ventures provide us with additional production capacity of approximately 24 billion pounds of pp approximately 14 billion pounds of olefins and approximately 09 billion pounds of pe these capacities are based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint ventures’ total capacities we realize profits or losses from these ventures as income or loss on the equity basis of accounting 

we generally license our polyolefin process technologies and supply catalysts to our joint ventures through our technology segment some of our joint ventures are able to source cost advantaged raw materials from their local shareholders 

raw materials 

raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost for the production of olefins and coproducts historically the primary raw material used in our european olefin facilities was naphtha however in recent years we increased our use of advantaged ngls for our saudi arabian joint venture facilities locally sourced and cost advantaged ngls including ethane propane and butane are used the principal raw materials used in the production of polyolefins are propylene and ethylene in europe we have the capacity to produce approximately 50 of the propylene requirements for our european pp production and all of the ethylene requirements for our european pe production propylene and ethylene requirements that are not produced internally are generally acquired pursuant to longterm contracts with third party suppliers or via spot purchases some of our joint ventures receive propylene and ethylene from their local shareholders under longterm contracts 

our ability to pass through the increased cost of raw materials to customers is dependent on global market demand for olefins and polyolefins in general the pricing for purchases and sales of most products is determined by global market forces including the impacts of foreign exchange relative to the pricing of the underlying naphtha raw materials most of which are priced in us dollars there can be a lag between naphtha raw material price changes and contract product price changes that will cause volatility in our product margins 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to olefins and polyolefins competition is based on price product quality product delivery reliability of supply product performance and customer service we compete with regional and multinational chemical companies and 

divisions of large oil companies the petrochemical market in the european union “eu” has been affected by the price volatility of naphtha the primary feedstock for olefins in the region as well as fluctuating demand as a result of changing european and global economic conditions 

based on published capacity data and including our proportionate share of our joint ventures we believe as of december 31 2018 we were 



intermediates and derivatives segment 

overview 

our id segment produces and markets propylene oxide “po” and its derivatives oxyfuels and related products and intermediate chemicals such as styrene monomer “sm” acetyls and ethylene oxides and derivatives 

po and derivatives— we produce po through two distinct technologies one of which yields tertiary butyl alcohol “tba” as the coproduct and the other of which yields sm as the coproduct the two technologies are mutually exclusive with dedicated assets for manufacturing either potba or posm po is an intermediate commodity chemical and is a precursor of polyols propylene glycol propylene glycol ethers and butanediol po and derivatives are used in a variety of durable and consumable items with key applications such as polyurethanes used for insulation automotivefurniture cushioning coatings surfactants synthetic resins and several other household usages 

oxyfuels and related products —we produce two distinct etherbased oxyfuels methyl tertiary butyl ether “mtbe” and ethyl tertiary butyl ether “etbe” these oxyfuels are produced by converting the tba coproduct of po into isobutylene and reacting with methanol or ethanol to produce either mtbe or etbe both are used as highoctane gasoline components that help gasoline burn cleaner and reduce automobile emissions other tba derivatives which we refer to as “c4 chemicals” are largely used to make synthetic rubber and other gasoline additives 

intermediate chemicals —we produce other commodity chemicals that utilize ethylene as a key component feedstock including sm acetyls and ethylene oxide derivatives sm is utilized in various applications such as plastics expandable polystyrene for packaging foam cups and containers insulation products and durables and engineering resins our acetyls products comprise methanol glacial acetic acid “gaa” and vinyl acetate monomer “vam” natural gas methane is the feedstock for methanol some of which is converted to gaa and a portion of the gaa is reacted with ethylene to create vam vam is an intermediate chemical used in fabric or wood treatments pigments coatings films and adhesives ethylene oxide is an intermediate chemical that is used to produce ethylene glycol glycol ethers and other derivatives ethylene oxide and its derivatives are used in the production of polyester antifreeze fluids solvents and other chemical products 

sales  marketing  customers 

we sell our po and derivatives through multiyear sales and processing agreements as well as spot sales some of our contract sales agreements have cost plus pricing terms po and derivatives are transported by barge marine vessel pipeline railcar and tank truck 

we sell our oxyfuels and related products under market and costbased sales agreements and in the spot market oxyfuels are transported by barge marine vessel and tank truck and are used as octane blending components worldwide outside of the united states due to their blending characteristics and emission benefits c4 chemicals such as highpurity isobutylene are 

sold to producers of synthetic rubber and other chemical products primarily in the united states and europe and are transported by railcar tank truck pipeline and marine shipments 

intermediate chemicals are shipped by barge marine vessel pipeline railcar and tank truck sm is sold globally into regions such as north america europe asia and south america export markets through spot sales and commercial contracts within acetyls methanol is consumed internally to make gaa used as a feedstock for oxyfuels and related products and also sold directly into the merchant commercial market gaa is converted with ethylene to produce vam which is sold worldwide under multiyear commercial contracts and on a spot basis 

sales of our po and derivatives oxyfuels and related products and intermediate chemicals are made by our marketing and sales personnel and also through distributors and independent agents in the americas europe the middle east africa and the asia pacific region 

joint venture relationships 

we have two po joint ventures with covestro ag one in the us and one in europe we operate four of the us po production facilities for the us po joint venture covestro’s interest represents ownership of an inkind portion of the po production of 15 billion pounds per year we take inkind the remaining po production and all coproduct production the parties’ rights in the joint venture are based on offtake volumes related to actual production of po as opposed to ownership percentages covestro also has the right to 50 of the po and sm production of our european po joint venture our proportional production capacity provided through this venture is approximately 340 million pounds of po and approximately 750 million pounds of sm we do not share marketing or product sales with covestro under either of these po joint ventures 

we also have a joint venture manufacturing relationship in china this venture provides us with additional production capacity of approximately 115 million pounds of po this capacity is based on our operational share of the joint venture’s total capacity 

raw materials 

the cost of raw materials is the largest component of total production cost for po its coproducts and its derivatives propylene isobutane or mixed butane ethylene and benzene are the primary raw materials used in the production of po and its coproducts the market prices of these raw materials historically have been related to the price of crude oil ngls and natural gas as well as supply and demand for the raw materials 

in the us we obtain a large portion of our propylene benzene and ethylene raw materials needed for the production of po and its coproducts from our op–americas segment and to a lesser extent from third parties raw materials for the nonus production of po and its coproducts are obtained from our op–eai segment and from third parties we consume a significant portion of our internallyproduced po in the production of po derivatives 

the raw material requirements not sourced internally are purchased at marketbased prices from numerous suppliers in the us and europe with which we have established contractual relationships as well as in the spot market 

for the production of oxyfuels we purchase our ethanol feedstock requirements from third parties and obtain our methanol from both internal production and external sources carbon monoxide and methanol are the primary raw materials required for the production of gaa we purchase carbon monoxide pursuant to a longterm contract with pricing primarily based on the cost of production the methanol required for our downstream production of acetyls is internally sourced from a partnership and from our methanol plant at channelview texas natural gas is the primary raw material required for the production of methanol 

in addition to ethylene acetic acid is a primary raw material for the production of vam we obtain all our requirements for acetic acid and ethylene from our internal production historically we have used a large percentage of our acetic acid production to produce vam 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to product competition the market is influenced and based on a variety of factors including product quality price reliability of supply technical support customer service and potential substitute materials profitability is affected by the worldwide level of demand along with price competition which may intensify due to among other things new industry capacity and industry outages demand growth could be impacted by further development of alternative biobased methodologies our major worldwide competitors include other multinational chemical and refining companies as well as some regional marketers and producers 

based on published capacity data excluding our partners’ shares of joint venture capacity we believe as of december 31 2018 we were

sales  marketing  customers 

our products are sold through our global sales organization to a broad base of established customers and distributors under contract or on a spot basis these products are transported to our customers primarily by either truck or bulk rail 

joint venture relationships 

we participate in several manufacturing joint ventures in australia malaysia saudi arabia hong kong thailand indonesia and argentina we do not hold majority interests in any of these joint ventures nor do we have operational control these ventures provide us with additional production capacity of approximately 170 million pounds of pp compounds approximately 20 million pounds of engineered composites approximately 35 million pounds of specialty powders and approximately 25 million pounds of masterbatch solutions these capacities are based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint ventures’ total capacities 

raw materials 

the principal materials used in the production of our compounding and solutions products are polypropylene polyethylene polystyrene nylon and titanium dioxide raw materials required for the production of our compounding and solutions products are obtained from our wholly owned or joint venture facilities and from a number of major plastic resin producers or other suppliers at marketbased prices 

the principal raw materials used in the production of advanced polymers are ethylene propylene and butene1 ethylene and propylene requirements that are not produced internally and externallysupplied butene1 are acquired through longterm contracts with third party suppliers or via spot purchases 

our ability to pass through the increased cost of raw materials to customers is dependent on global market demand in general the pricing for purchases and sales of most products is determined by global market forces 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to product competition the market is influenced and based on a variety of factors including price product quality product delivery reliability of supply product performance and customer service we compete with regional and multinational marketers and producers of plastic resins and compounds 

based on published capacity data and including our proportionate share of our joint ventures we believe as of december 31 2018  we were the largest global producer of polypropylene compounds 

refining segment 

overview 

the primary products of our refining segment are refined products made from heavy highsulfur crude oil and other crude oils of varied types and sources available on the us gulf coast these refined products include gasoline and other distillates 

sales  marketing  customers 

the houston refinery’s products are primarily sold in bulk to other refiners marketers distributors and wholesalers at marketrelated prices most of the houston refinery’s products are sold under contracts with a term of one year or less or are sold in the spot market the houston refinery’s products generally are transported to customers via pipelines and terminals owned and operated by other parties the sales of refined products accounted for approximately 21 18 and 16 of our total revenues in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

raw materials 

our houston refinery which is located on the houston ship channel in houston texas has a heavy highsulfur crude oil processing capacity of approximately 268000 barrels per day on a calendar day basis normal operating basis or approximately 292000 barrels per day on a stream day basis maximum achievable over a 24hour period the houston refinery is a full conversion refinery designed to refine heavy highsulfur crude oil this crude oil is more viscous and dense than traditional crude oil and contains higher concentrations of sulfur and heavy metals making it more difficult to refine into gasoline and other highvalue fuel products while heavy highsulfur crude oil has historically been less costly to purchase than light lowsulfur crude oil in recent years the price difference has narrowed us production is predominantly light sweet crude and much of the heavy crude has generally been imported from canada venezuela and other global producers which has at times been subject to supply disruptions 

we purchase the crude oil used as a raw material for the houston refinery on the open market on a spot basis and under a number of supply agreements with regional producers generally with terms varying from one to two years 

industry dynamics  competition 

our refining competitors are major integrated oil companies refineries owned or controlled by foreign governments and independent domestic refiners based on published data as of january 2018 there were 135 operable crude oil refineries in the us and total us refinery capacity was approximately 186 million barrels per day during 2018 the houston refinery processed an average of approximately 231000  barrels per day of heavy crude oil 

our refining operations compete for the purchases of crude oil based on price and quality supply disruptions could impact the availability and pricing we compete in gasoline and distillate markets as a bulk supplier of fungible products satisfying industry and government specifications competition is based on price and location 

the markets for fuel products tend to be volatile as well as cyclical as a result of the changing global economy and changing crude oil and refined product prices crude oil prices are impacted by worldwide political events the economics of exploration and production and refined products demand prices and demand for fuel products are influenced by seasonal and shortterm factors such as weather and driving patterns as well as by longer term issues such as the economy energy conservation and alternative fuels industry fuel products supply is dependent on shortterm industry operating capabilities and on longterm refining capacity 

a crack spread is a benchmark indication of refining margins based on the processing of a specific type of crude oil into an assumed selection of major refined products the houston refinery generally tracks the maya 211 crack spread which represents the difference between the current month gulf coast price of two barrels of maya crude oil as set by petróleos mexicanos “pemex” and one barrel each of us gulf coast reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending “rbob” gasoline and of us gulf coast ultra low sulfur diesel “ulsd” while these benchmark refining spreads are generally indicative of the level of profitability at the houston refinery and similarly configured refineries there are many other factors specific to each refinery and the industry in general such as the value of refinery byproducts which influence operating results refinery byproducts are products other than gasoline and distillates that represent about onethird of the total product volume and include coke sulfur and lighter materials such as ngls and crude olefins streams the cost of renewable identification numbers “rins” which are renewable fuel credits mandated by the us environmental protection agency the “epa” can also affect profitability 

technology segment 

overview 

our technology segment develops and licenses chemical and polyolefin process technologies and manufactures and sells polyolefin catalysts we market our process technologies and our polyolefin catalysts to external customers and also use them in our own manufacturing operations approximately 25 of our catalyst sales are intercompany 

our polyolefin process licenses are structured to provide a standard core technology with individual customer needs met by adding customized modules that provide the required capabilities to produce the defined production grade slate and plant capacity in addition to the basic license agreement a range of services can also be provided including project assistance training assistance in starting up the plant and ongoing technical support after startup we may also offer marketing and sales services in addition licensees may continue to purchase polyolefin catalysts that are consumed in the production process generally under longterm catalyst supply agreements with us 

research and development 

our research and development “rd” activities are designed to improve our existing products and processes and discover and commercialize new materials catalysts and processes these activities focus on product and application development process development catalyst development and fundamental polyolefinfocused research 

in 2018 2017 and 2016 our rd expenditures were 115 million  106 million and 99 million respectively a portion of these expenses are related to technical support and customer service and are allocated to the other business segments in 2018 2017 and 2016 approximately 45  of all rd costs were allocated to business segments other than technology

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 

our business including our results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected by safety or product liability issues 

failure to appropriately manage safety human health product liability and environmental risks associated with our products product life cycles and production processes could adversely impact employees communities stakeholders our reputation and our results of operations public perception of the risks associated with our products and production processes could impact product acceptance and influence the regulatory environment in which we operate while we have procedures and controls to manage safety risks issues could be created by events outside of our control including natural disasters severe weather events and acts of sabotage 

our operations are subject to risks inherent in chemical and refining businesses and we could be subject to liabilities for which we are not fully insured or that are not otherwise mitigated 

we maintain property business interruption product general liability casualty and other types of insurance that we believe are appropriate for our business and operations as well as in line with industry practices however we are not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to our business including losses resulting from natural disasters wars or terrorist acts changes in insurance market conditions have caused and may in the future cause premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies to increase substantially and in some instances for certain insurance to become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured we might not be able to finance the amount of the uninsured liability on terms acceptable to us or at all and might be obligated to divert a significant portion of our cash flow from normal business operations 

further because a part of our business involves licensing polyolefin process technology our licensees are exposed to similar risks involved in the manufacture and marketing of polyolefins hazardous incidents involving our licensees if they do result or are perceived to result from use of our technologies may harm our reputation threaten our relationships with other licensees andor lead to customer attrition and financial losses our policy of covering these risks through contractual limitations of liability and indemnities and through insurance may not always be effective as a result our financial condition and results of operation would be adversely affected and other companies with competing technologies may have the opportunity to secure a competitive advantage 

a sustained decrease in the price of crude oil may adversely impact the results of our operations primarily in north america 

energy costs generally follow price trends of crude oil and natural gas these price trends may be highly volatile and cyclical in the past raw material and energy costs have experienced significant fluctuations that adversely affected our business segments’ results of operations for example we have benefited from the favorable ratio of us crude oil prices to natural gas prices in recent years if the price of crude oil remains lower relative to us natural gas prices or if the demand for natural gas and ngls increases this may have a negative impact on our results of operations 

costs and limitations on supply of raw materials and energy may result in increased operating expenses 

the costs of raw materials and energy represent a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to the significant competition we face and the commodity nature of many of our products we are not always able to pass on raw material and energy cost increases to our customers when we do have the ability to pass on the cost increases we are not always able to do so quickly enough to avoid adverse impacts on our results of operations 

cost increases for raw materials also may increase working capital needs which could reduce our liquidity and cash flow even if we increase our sales prices to reflect rising raw material and energy costs demand for products may decrease as customers reduce their consumption or use substitute products which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition producers in natural gas costadvantaged regions such as the middle east and north america benefit from the lower prices of natural gas and ngls competition from producers in these regions may cause us to reduce exports from europe and elsewhere any such reductions may increase competition for product sales within europe and other markets which can result in lower margins in those regions 

for some of our raw materials and utilities there are a limited number of suppliers and in some cases the supplies are specific to the particular geographic region in which a facility is located it is also common in the chemical and refining industries for a facility to have a sole dedicated source for its utilities such as steam electricity and gas having a sole or limited number of suppliers may limit our negotiating power particularly in the case of rising raw material costs any new supply agreements we enter into may not have terms as favorable as those contained in our current supply agreements 

additionally there is growing concern over the reliability of water sources including around the texas gulf coast where several of our facilities are located the decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of population growth drought or regulation could negatively impact our operations 

if our raw material or utility supplies were disrupted our businesses may incur increased costs to procure alternative supplies or incur excessive downtime which would have a direct negative impact on plant operations disruptions of supplies may occur as a result of transportation issues resulting from natural disasters water levels and interruptions in marine water routes among other causes that can affect the operations of vessels barges rails trucks and pipeline traffic these risks are particularly prevalent in the us gulf coast area additionally increasing exports of ngls and crude oil from the us or greater restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could restrict the availability of our raw materials thereby increasing our costs 

with increased volatility in raw material costs our suppliers could impose more onerous terms on us resulting in shorter payment cycles and increasing our working capital requirements 

our ability to source raw materials may be adversely affected by political instability civil disturbances or other governmental actions 

we obtain a portion of our principal raw materials from sources in the middle east and central and south america that may be less politically stable than other areas in which we conduct business such as europe or the us political instability civil disturbances and actions by governments in these areas are more likely to substantially increase the price and decrease the supply of raw materials necessary for our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

increased incidents of civil unrest including terrorist attacks and demonstrations that have been marked by violence have occurred in a number of countries in the middle east and south america some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest political instability and civil unrest could continue to spread in the region and involve other areas such unrest if it continues to spread or grow in intensity could lead to civil wars regional conflicts or regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to countries in which we conduct substantial business such as in europe the us or their respective trading partners 

economic disruptions and downturns in general and particularly continued global economic uncertainty or economic turmoil in emerging markets could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

our results of operations can be materially affected by adverse conditions in the financial markets and depressed economic conditions generally economic downturns in the businesses and geographic areas in which we sell our products could substantially reduce demand for our products and result in decreased sales volumes and increased credit risk recessionary environments adversely affect our business because demand for our products is reduced particularly from our customers in industrial markets generally and the automotive and housing industries specifically and may result in higher costs of capital a significant portion of our revenues and earnings are derived from our business in europe including southern 

europe in addition most of our european transactions and assets including cash reserves and receivables are denominated in euros 

we also derive significant revenues from our business in emerging markets particularly the emerging markets in asia and south america any broadbased downturn in these emerging markets or in a key market such as china could require us to reduce export volumes into these markets and could also require us to divert product sales to less profitable markets any of these conditions could ultimately harm our overall business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

the cyclicality and volatility of the industries in which we participate may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 

our business operations are subject to the cyclical and volatile nature of the supplydemand balance in the chemical and refining industries our future operating results are expected to continue to be affected by this cyclicality and volatility the chemical and refining industries historically have experienced alternating periods of capacity shortages causing prices and profit margins to increase followed by periods of excess capacity resulting in oversupply declining capacity utilization rates and declining prices and profit margins 

in addition to changes in the supply and demand for products changes in energy prices and other worldwide economic conditions can cause volatility these factors result in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over business cycles 

new capacity additions in asia the middle east and north america may lead to periods of oversupply and lower profitability a sizable number of expansions have recently started up in north america the timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions are uncertain and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time as a consequence we are unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of future industry cycles or their effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we sell products in highly competitive global markets and face significant price pressures 

we sell our products in highly competitive global markets due to the commodity nature of many of our products competition in these markets is based primarily on price and to a lesser extent on product performance product quality product deliverability reliability of supply and customer service often we are not able to protect our market position for these products by product differentiation and may not be able to pass on cost increases to our customers due to the significant competition in our business 

in addition we face increased competition from companies that may have greater financial resources and different cost structures or strategic goals than us these include large integrated oil companies some of which also have chemical businesses governmentowned businesses and companies that receive subsidies or other government incentives to produce certain products in a specified geographic region continuing competition from these companies especially in our olefin and refining businesses could limit our ability to increase product sales prices in response to raw material and other cost increases or could cause us to reduce product sales prices to compete effectively which would reduce our profitability competitors with different cost structures or strategic goals than we have may be able to invest significant capital into their businesses including expenditures for research and development in addition specialty products we produce may become commoditized over time increased competition could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 

interruptions of operations at our facilities may result in liabilities or lower operating results 

we own and operate largescale facilities our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our various production facilities and the ability to complete construction and maintenance projects on schedule interruptions at our facilities may materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or our business as a whole during and after the period of such operational difficulties in the past we had to shut down plants on the us gulf coast including the temporary shutdown of a portion of our houston refinery as a result of hurricanes striking the texas coast in addition because the houston refinery is our only refining operation an outage at the refinery could have a particularly 

negative impact on our operating results unlike our chemical and polymer production facilities which may have sufficient excess capacity to mitigate the negative impact of lost production at other facilities we do not have the ability to increase refining production elsewhere 

although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions our operations are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and refining and the related storage and transportation of raw materials products and wastes these potential hazards include 

 some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or personal injury and loss of life and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date negatively impacting project returns if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering procurement and construction of facilities could materially adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors many of which are beyond our control including 



 any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects if we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs or if market conditions change it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increased it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products facilities and services 

increased global information security threats and more sophisticated targeted computer crime pose a risk to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data operations and infrastructure while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including security measures employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our employees systems networks products facilities and services remain potentially vulnerable to sophisticated espionage or cyberassault depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations 

we operate internationally and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations exchange controls political risks and other risks relating to international operations 

we operate internationally and are subject to the risks of doing business on a global level these risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates economic instability and disruptions restrictions on the transfer of funds and the imposition of trade restrictions or duties and tariffs additional risks from our multinational business include transportation delays and interruptions war terrorist activities epidemics pandemics political instability import and export controls changes in governmental policies labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments 

we generate revenues from export sales and operations that may be denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency exchange rates between these currencies and functional currencies in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future it is possible that fluctuations in exchange rates will result in reduced operating results additionally we operate with the objective of having our worldwide cash available in the locations where it is needed including the united kingdom for our parent company’s significant cash obligations as a result of dividend and interest payments it is possible that we may not always be able to provide cash to other jurisdictions when needed or that such transfers of cash could be subject to additional taxes including withholding taxes 

our operating results could be negatively affected by the global laws rules and regulations as well as political environments in the jurisdictions in which we operate there could be reduced demand for our products decreases in the prices at which we can sell our products and disruptions of production or other operations trade protection measures such as quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures or antidumping duties imposed in the countries in which we operate could negatively impact our business additionally there may be substantial capital and other costs to comply with regulations andor increased security costs or insurance premiums any of which could reduce our operating results 

we obtain a portion of our principal raw materials from international sources that are subject to these same risks our compliance with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject could be challenged furthermore these laws may be modified the result of which may be to prevent or limit subsidiaries from transferring cash to us 

furthermore we are subject to certain existing and may be subject to possible future laws that limit or may limit our activities while some of our competitors may not be subject to such laws which may adversely affect our competitiveness 

changes in tax laws and regulations could affect our tax rate and our results of operations 

we are a tax resident in the united kingdom and are subject to the united kingdom corporate income tax system lyondellbasell industries nv has little or no taxable income of its own because as a holding company it does not conduct any operations through our subsidiaries we have substantial operations worldwide taxes are primarily paid on the earnings generated in various jurisdictions including the us the netherlands germany france and italy 

in 2017 the us enacted “hr1” also known as the “tax cuts and jobs act” the “tax act” materially impacting our consolidated financial statements by among other things decreasing the tax rate and significantly affecting future periods to determine the full effects of the tax law for 2018 we are awaiting the finalization of several proposed us treasury regulations under the tax act that were issued during 2018 as well as additional regulations to be proposed and finalized pursuant to the us treasury’s expanded regulatory authority under the tax act it is also possible that technical correction legislation concerning the tax act could retroactively affect tax liabilities for 2018 we will continue to analyze the tax act to determine the full effects of the new law as additional regulations are proposed and finalized 

interest income earned by certain of our european subsidiaries through intercompany financings is either untaxed or taxed at rates substantially lower than the us statutory rate tax regulations proposed in 2018 may affect tax deductible interest in the us in future periods however we do not believe they will have a material impact as proposed in addition in 2016 the us treasury issued final section 385 debtequity regulations that impact our internal financings beginning in 2017 pursuant to a 2017 executive order the treasury department reviewed these regulations and determined that they should be retained subject to further review following the enactment of us tax reform we are awaiting the us treasury’s review of the existing section 385 debtequity regulations which could impact our internal financings in future years as well as any final regulations impacting interest deductions under the tax act in addition there has been an increased attention both in the us and globally to the tax practices of multinational companies including the european union’s state aid investigations proposals by the organization for economic cooperation and development with respect to base erosion and profit shifting and european union tax directives such attention may result in further legislative changes that could adversely affect our tax rate other than the tax act management does not believe that recent changes in income tax laws will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements although new or proposed changes to tax laws could affect our tax liabilities in the future 

many of our businesses depend on our intellectual property our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and our inability to do so could reduce our ability to maintain our competitiveness and margins 

we have a significant worldwide patent portfolio of issued and pending patents these patents and patent applications together with proprietary technical knowhow are significant to our competitive position particularly with regard to po intermediate chemicals polyolefins licensing and catalysts we rely on the patent copyright and trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing however we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without authorization proceedings to protect these rights could be costly and we may not prevail 

the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes apparatuses technology trade secrets or proprietary knowhow could result in significantly lower revenues reduced profit margins and cash flows andor loss of market share we also may be subject to claims that our technology patents or other intellectual property infringes on a third party’s intellectual property rights unfavorable resolution of these claims could result in restrictions on our ability to deliver the related service or in a settlement that could be material to us 

shared control or lack of control of joint ventures may delay decisions or actions regarding our joint ventures 

a portion of our operations are conducted through joint ventures where control may be exercised by or shared with unaffiliated third parties we cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners including any nonperformance default or bankruptcy of joint venture partners the joint ventures that we do not control may also lack financial reporting systems to provide adequate and timely information for our reporting purposes 

our joint venture partners may have different interests or goals than we do and may take actions contrary to our requests policies or objectives differences in views among the joint venture participants also may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major matters potentially adversely affecting the business and operations of the joint ventures and in turn our business and operations we may develop a dispute with any of our partners over decisions affecting the venture that may result in litigation arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution if a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interest it could harm our brand business results of operations and financial condition 

we cannot predict with certainty the extent of future costs under environmental health and safety and other laws and regulations and cannot guarantee they will not be material 

we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture handle or own in addition because our products are components of a variety of other enduse products we along with other members of the chemical industry are subject to potential claims related to those enduse products any substantial increase in the success of these types of claims could negatively affect our operating results 

we are subject to extensive national regional state and local environmental laws regulations directives rules and ordinances concerning 

 many of these laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations in addition some of these laws and regulations require us to meet specific financial responsibility requirements any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

although we have compliance programs and other processes intended to ensure compliance with all such regulations we are subject to the risk that our compliance with such regulations could be challenged noncompliance with certain of these regulations could result in the incurrence of additional costs penalties or assessments that could be material 

our industry is subject to extensive government regulation and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures 

compliance with regulatory requirements could result in higher operating costs such as regulatory requirements relating to emissions the security of our facilities and the transportation export or registration of our products we generally expect that regulatory controls worldwide will become increasingly more demanding but cannot accurately predict future developments 

increasingly strict environmental laws and inspection and enforcement policies could affect the handling manufacture use emission or disposal of products other materials or hazardous and nonhazardous waste stricter environmental safety and health laws regulations and enforcement policies could result in increased operating costs or capital expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations additionally we are required to have permits for our businesses and are subject to licensing regulations these permits and licenses are subject to renewal modification and in some circumstances revocation further the permits and licenses are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

we may incur substantial costs to comply with climate change legislation and related regulatory initiatives 

there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas “ghg” reduction these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may 

have interests in the future laws and regulations in this field continue to evolve and while they are likely to be increasingly widespread and stringent at this stage it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation under the 2015 paris agreement parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change agreed to undertake ambitious efforts to reduce ghg emissions and strengthen adaptation to the effects of climate change while the us notified the united nations in august 2017 that it will be withdrawing from the agreement other countries in which we operate including germany france and the netherlands are preparing national climate acts and protection plans to implement their emission reduction commitments under the agreement these actions could result in increased cost of purchased energy and increased costs of compliance for impacted locations within the framework of the eu emissions trading scheme “ets” we were allocated certain allowances of carbon dioxide for the affected plants of our european sites for the period from 2008 to 2012 “ets ii period” the ets ii period did not bring additional cost to us as the allowance allocation was sufficient to cover the actual emissions of the affected plants we were able to build an allowance surplus during the ets ii period which has been banked to the scheme for the period from 2013 to 2020 “ets iii period” we expect to incur additional costs for the ets iii period despite the allowance surplus accrued over the ets ii period as allowance allocations have been reduced for the ets iii period and more of our plants are affected by the scheme we maintain an active hedging strategy to cover these additional costs we expect to incur additional costs in relation to future carbon or ghg emission trading schemes 

in the us the epa has promulgated federal ghg regulations under the clean air act affecting certain sources the epa has issued mandatory ghg reporting requirements requirements to obtain ghg permits for certain industrial plants and ghg performance standards for some facilities although the epa recently proposed to repeal and replace certain ghg requirements additional ghg regulation may be forthcoming at the us federal or state level that could result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances 

compliance with these or other changes in laws regulations and obligations that create a ghg emissions trading scheme or ghg reduction policies generally could significantly increase our costs or reduce demand for products we produce additionally compliance with these regulations may result in increased permitting necessary for the operation of our business or for any of our growth plans difficulties in obtaining such permits could have an adverse effect on our future growth therefore any future potential regulations and legislation could result in increased compliance costs additional operating restrictions or delays in implementing growth projects or other capital investments and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition climate changes such as drought conditions or increased frequency and severity of hurricanes and floods could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations  

we may be required to record material charges against our earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets 

we may be required to reduce production or idle facilities for extended periods of time or exit certain businesses as a result of the cyclical nature of our industry specifically oversupplies of or lack of demand for particular products or high raw material prices may cause us to reduce production we may choose to reduce production at certain facilities because we have offtake arrangements at other facilities which make any reductions or idling unavailable at those facilities any decision to permanently close facilities or exit a business likely would result in impairment and other charges to earnings 

temporary outages at our facilities can last for several quarters and sometimes longer these outages could cause us to incur significant costs including the expenses of maintaining and restarting these facilities in addition even though we may reduce production at facilities we may be required to continue to purchase or pay for utilities or raw materials under takeorpay supply agreements 

increased regulation or deselection of plastic could lead to a decrease in demand growth for some of our products   

in 2018 the european union proposed rules to target the plastic products most often found on beaches and in seas in addition local and other governments have increasingly proposed or implemented bans on plastic items such as disposable bags and straws as well as other food packaging additionally plastics have recently faced increased public backlash and scrutiny increased regulation of or prohibition on the use of plastics could increase the costs incurred by our customers to use such products or otherwise limit the use of these products and could lead to a decrease in demand for pe pp and other products we make such a decrease in demand could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our business is capital intensive and we rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and ongoing capital needs limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results 

we require significant capital to operate our current business and fund our growth strategy moreover interest payments dividends and the expansion of our business or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital we believe that our cash from operations currently will be sufficient to meet these needs however if we need external financing our access to credit markets and pricing of our capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies and the state of the capital markets generally there can be no assurances that we would be able to incur indebtedness on terms we deem acceptable and it is possible that the cost of any financings could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities which could adversely affect our operating results 

we may use our fiveyear 25 billion revolving credit facility which backs our commercial paper program to meet our cash needs to the extent available as of december 31 2018  we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the facility and 809 million  net of discount outstanding under our commercial paper program leaving an unused and available credit capacity of 1688 million  we may also meet our cash needs by selling receivables under our 900 million  us accounts receivable facility in the event of a default under our credit facility or any of our senior notes we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do any default under any of our credit arrangements could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate 

legislation and regulatory initiatives could lead to a decrease in demand for our products 

new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health safety and the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products initiatives by governments and private interest groups will potentially require increased toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us for example in the united states the national toxicology program “ntp” is a federal interagency program that seeks to identify and select for study chemicals and other substances to evaluate potential human health hazards in the european union the regulation on registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals “reach” is regulation designed to identify the intrinsic properties of chemical substances assess hazards and risks of the substances and identify and implement the risk management measures to protect humans and the environment 

assessments under ntp reach or similar programs or regulations in other jurisdictions may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals we use or produce and may result in additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of those chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

adverse results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us 

we are subject to and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty irrespective of its merits litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expenditure and diversion of management attention we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations should we fail to prevail in certain matters 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may adversely affect the valuation of pension obligations the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rates used to measure pension obligations the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets 

significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets may result in corresponding increases and decreases in the value of plan assets particularly equity securities or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets any changes in key actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate or mortality rate would impact the valuation of pension obligations affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years 

nearly all of our current pension plans have projected benefit obligations that exceed the fair value of the plan assets as of december 31 2018 the aggregate deficit was 992 million  any declines in the fair values of the pension plans’ assets could require additional payments by us in order to maintain specified funding levels 

our pension plans are subject to legislative and regulatory requirements of applicable jurisdictions which could include under certain circumstances local governmental authority to terminate the plan 

integration of acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price 

we have and may continue to make acquisitions in order to enhance our business acquisitions involve numerous risks including with respect to meeting our standards for compliance problems combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs and liabilities diversion of management’s attention from our core businesses and potential loss of key employees 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to integrate successfully any businesses products technologies or personnel that we might acquire the integration of businesses that we may acquire is likely to be a complex timeconsuming and expensive process and we may not realize the anticipated revenues synergies or other benefits associated with our acquisitions if we do not manage and operate the acquired business up to our expectations if we are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems operating procedures financial controls and human resources practices our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected

environmental 

most of our operations are affected by national state regional and local environmental laws matters pertaining to the environment are discussed in part i item 1a risk factors  part i item 3 legal proceedings  part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation s and notes 2  and 19  to the consolidated financial statements 

we have made and intend to continue to make the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to environmental health and safety matters we incurred capital expenditures of 212 million in 2018 for health safety and environmental compliance purposes and improvement programs and estimate such expenditures to be approximately 230 million in each of 2019 and 2020 

while capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance including compliance with potential legislation and potential regulation related to climate change cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe they will have a material effect on our competitive position 

while there can be no assurance that physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future we do not believe these risks are material in the near term

environmental matters 

from time to time we and our joint ventures receive notices or inquiries from government entities regarding alleged violations of environmental laws and regulations pertaining to among other things the disposal emission and storage of chemical and petroleum substances including hazardous wastes item 103 of the sec’s regulation sk requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and the proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that we reasonably believe could exceed 100000 the matters below are disclosed solely pursuant to that requirement 

in september 2013 the environmental protection agency “epa” region v issued a notice and finding of violation alleging violations at our morris illinois facility related to flaring activity the notice generally alleges failures to monitor steam usage and improper flare operations region v indicated at a december 2017 meeting that it intends to issue an administrative enforcement order in 2018 we reasonably believe that epa region v may assert a penalty demand in excess of 100000 a tolling agreement was signed in november 2018 

in june 2014 epa region v issued a notice and finding of violation alleging violations at our tuscola illinois facility related to flaring activity the notice generally alleges failure to conduct a valid performance test and improper flare operations in june 2018 region v issued a draft administrative consent order that requires the completion of certain activities we are currently engaged in discussions with region v regarding a proposed penalty we reasonably believe that the penalty may exceed 100000 a tolling agreement was signed in november 2018 

the epa has been conducting an enforcement initiative regarding flare emissions at petrochemical plants in july 2014 we received clean air act section 114 information request regarding flares at four us facilities in response to the information we provided and subsequent discussions the epa and department of justice the “doj” have indicated that they are seeking a consent decree that would require certain corrective measures we reasonably believe that resolution of this matter will involve payment of a monetary sanction in excess of 100000 we continue to work with the epa and doj to resolve this matter 

in january 2018 houston refining lp learned that the texas commission on environmental quality had referred an environmental matter to the texas attorney general’s office “tago” for enforcement the environmental matter referred to tago for enforcement stems from air emissions events sustained at the refinery in june 2018 houston refining lp and tago agreed to a settlement involving 680000 in penalties plus attorneys’ fees and certain injunctive relief to effectuate the settlement the tago filed a complaint along with the proposed agreed final judgment in travis county court the court entered the agreed final judgment in october 2018 and the penalty has been paid in full 

in march 2018 the morris facility learned that the illinois epa referred an environmental matter to the illinois attorney general’s office the matters referred for enforcement relate to air emission events at the facility in june 2018 the parties agreed to resolve the matter for a penalty of 125000 and in august 2018 a consent order requiring the same was entered in grundy county court 

on march 21 2018 the cologne germany local court issued a regulatory fine notice of €1800000 arising from a pipeline leak in our wesseling germany facility we expect the cologne prosecutor to issue a corresponding payment request which will resolve the matter

general 

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes elsewhere in this report when we use the terms “we” “us” “our” or similar words in this discussion unless the context otherwise requires we are referring to lyondellbasell industries nv and its consolidated subsidiaries “lyondellbasell nv” 

overview 

during 2018 we continued to deliver strong earnings despite market challenges in the second half of the year and planned and unplanned downtime that negatively impacted fourth quarter 2018 results by approximately 225 million noteworthy annual results for our id segment driven by market improvements and targeted contracting strategies and in our technology segment due to an increased number of polyolefin technology licenses were partially offset by declines in our op–americas and op–eai results with our acquisition of a schulman inc “a schulman” in august 2018 we captured an opportunity to expand into new markets and created an additional platform for growth we continued to manage our business portfolio by among other things investing in a recycling joint venture and divesting our carbon black subsidiary in france 

as oil prices fell by 40 during the fourth quarter 2018 our op–eai segment experienced declining demand as customers delayed orders and destocked inventories in expectations of lower pricing this destocking and associated pricing pressures compounded the effects of typical fourth quarter seasonality our op–eai segment was also impacted by low water levels on the rhine river extended maintenance at our wesseling germany cracker and feedstock supply constraints at our münchsmünster germany cracker during the fourth quarter our aps segment volumes were affected by decreased automotive demand in recent quarters and our refining segment’s fourth quarter margins were negatively impacted by high gasoline inventories and unusually weak discounts for maya crude oil 

significant items that affected ebitda in 2018 relative to 2017 include 

 other noteworthy items in 2018 include the following 



 

results of operations for the periods discussed are presented in the table below 

  

results of operations 

revenues —we had revenues of 39004 million in 2018 34484 million in 2017 and 29183 million in 2016 

2018 versus 2017— revenues increased by 4520 million  or 13  in 2018 compared to 2017 

higher average sales prices led to a revenue increase of 11  in 2018 average sales prices in 2018 were higher for most of our products as sales prices generally correlate with crude oil prices which increased relative to 2017 despite a 40 decrease in oil prices during the fourth quarter 2018 a revenue decrease of 1  in 2018 reflects lower sales volumes for our op – americas op – eai and aps segments which were partly offset by an improvement in refining and id segment sales volumes favorable foreign exchange impacts in 2018 resulted in a revenue increase of 1  relative to the prior year period the operations of a schulman contributed 846 million  of revenues following the acquisition which accounts for the remaining improvement in revenues for 2018 

2017 versus 2016— revenues increased by 5301 million or 18 in 2017 compared to 2016 

average sales prices in 2017 were higher across most products as sales prices generally correlate with crude oil and natural gas prices which on average increased compared to the corresponding period in 2016 these higher prices led to a 15 increase in revenues higher sales volumes in our op – americas op – eai and refining segments which were partly offset by lower id segment volumes led to a revenue increase in 2017 of 2 favorable foreign exchange impacts were responsible for a 1 revenue increase in 2017 

cost of sales —cost of sales were 32529 million in 2018 28059 million in 2017 and 23191 million in 2016 

fluctuations in our cost of sales are generally driven by changes in feedstock and energy costs as all other material components remain relatively flat from year to year feedstock and energy related costs generally represent approximately 75 to 80 of cost of sales other variable costs account for approximately 10 of cost of sales on an annual basis and fixed operating costs consisting primarily of expenses associated with employee compensation depreciation and amortization and maintenance range from approximately 10 to 15 in each annual period 

2018 versus 2017— cost of sales increased by 4470 million  or 16  in 2018 compared to 2017 this increase in cost of sales is primarily due to increases in feedstock and energy costs costs for crude oil heavy liquid feedstocks and natural gas liquids “ngls” and other feedstocks were higher in 2018 relative to 2017 

2017 versus 2016— cost of sales increased by 4868 million or 21 in 2017 compared to 2016 this increase was primarily due to higher feedstock and energy costs costs for crude oil heavy liquid feedstocks ngls and natural gas were higher in 2017 relative to 2016 

sga expense —selling general and administrative “sga” expenses were 1129 million  in 2018 859 million  in 2017 and 833 million  in 2016 

2018 versus 2017— sga expenses increased by 270 million  in 2018 compared to 2017 

the 105 million  of sga expenses incurred by the operations of a schulman following the acquisition together with 73 million  of acquisition and integration costs associated with the acquisition accounted for approximately 66  of the 2018 increase in sga expenses higher employeerelated expenses accounted for approximately 26  of the increase in 2018 sga expense 

operating income —our operating income was 5231 million  in 2018 5460 million in 2017 and 5060 million in 2016 

2018 versus 2017— operating income decreased by 229 million  in 2018 compared to 2017 

operating income for our op – eai op – americas aps and refining segments declined 626 million  131 million  76 million  and 6 million  respectively over 2017 these declines were partially offset by increases in operating income of 514 million  and 101 million  in our id and technology segments respectively 

2017 versus 2016— operating income increased by 400 million in 2017 this improvement over 2016 was primarily due to increases of 144 million 101 million and 74 million in operating income for our id op – eai and op – americas segments respectively and 77 million of lower operating losses for our refining segment 

operating results for each of our business segments are reviewed further in the “segment analysis” section below 

interest expense —interest expense was 360 million in 2018 491 million in 2017 and 322 million in 2016 

in 2017 we recognized charges totaling 113 million  related to the march 2017 redemption of 1000 million of our outstanding 5 senior notes due 2019 these charges included 65 million  of prepayment premiums 44 million  for adjustments associated with fair value hedges and 4 million  for the writeoff of associated unamortized debt issuance costs 

2018 versus 2017— interest expense decreased by 131 million  in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the 2017 redemption of 1000 million of our 5 senior notes due 2019 as discussed above higher capitalized interest accounted for 25 million  of lower interest expense relative to 2017 

2017 versus 2016— in 2017 interest expense increased 169 million  in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the 2017 redemption of 1000 of our 5 senior notes due 2019 as discussed above a reduction in the amount of capitalized interest and increased charges from our fair value hedges resulted in incremental increases in interest expense of 13 million and 45 million respectively relative to 2016 

for additional information related to our fair value hedges see notes 13  and 15  to the consolidated financial statements 

other income net —other income net was 106 million in 2018 179 million in 2017 and 111 million in 2016 

2018 versus 2017— other income net decreased by 73 million  in 2018 compared to 2017 in 2018 we recognized a 36 million  gain in our op–eai segment related to the sale of our carbon black subsidiary in france we also recognized 24 million of foreign exchange gains and approximately 45 million of other income primarily related to gains on investments dividend income and pension benefits in 2017 we recognized gains of 108 million on the sale of our op–eai segment’s interest in its geosel joint venture and 31 million on the sale of a portion of property in lake charles louisiana we also recognized a 21 million noncash gain in our op–eai segment related to the elimination of an obligation related to a lease in 2017 

2017 versus 2016— the 68 million increase in other income net is primarily due to the gains discussed above related to the sales of our joint venture interest a property in lake charles louisiana and the elimination of the obligation associated with a lease discussed above as compared to the gain recognized in 2016 related to the sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary we allocated 57 million and 21 million of that gain to our op–americas and aps segments respectively 

income from equity investments —our income from equity investments was 289 million in 2018 321 million in 2017 and 367 million in 2016 

2018 versus 2017— income from our equity investments decreased in 2018 largely as a result of reduced polyolefin spreads 

2017 versus 2016— income from our equity investments decreased in 2017 mainly due to lower results for our joint ventures in poland asia and mexico  

income taxes— our effective income tax rates of 115  in 2018 109 in 2017 and 265 in 2016 resulted in tax provisions of  613  million 598 million and 1386 million respectively 

in 2017 the us enacted “hr1” also known as the “tax cuts and jobs act” the “tax act” materially impacting our consolidated financial statements by among other things decreasing the tax rate and significantly affecting future periods to determine the full effects of the tax law for 2018 we are awaiting the finalization of several proposed us treasury regulations under the tax act that were issued during 2018 as well as additional regulations to be proposed and finalized pursuant to the treasury’s expanded regulatory authority under the tax act it is also possible that technical correction legislation concerning the tax act could retroactively affect tax liabilities for 2018 the tax act reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 for years beginning after 2017 which resulted in the remeasurement of our us net deferred income tax liabilities as a result we recognized a tax benefit of 819 million  in 2017 including subsequent adjustments made in 2018 the cumulative impact of the remeasurement of our us net deferred income tax liabilities and tax accruals was an 814 million  income tax benefit 

our effective income tax rate fluctuates based on among other factors changes in pretax income in countries with varying statutory tax rates the us domestic production activity deduction that applied to periods prior to 2018 changes in valuation allowances changes in foreign exchange gainslosses the amount of exempt income and changes in unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions 

our exempt income primarily includes interest income export incentives and equity earnings of our joint ventures interest income earned by certain of our european subsidiaries through intercompany financings is either untaxed or taxed at rates substantially lower than the us statutory rate tax regulations proposed in 2018 may affect tax deductible interest in the us in future periods however we do not believe they will have a material impact as proposed export incentives relate to tax benefits derived from elections and structures available for us exports equity earnings attributable to the earnings of our joint ventures when paid through dividends to certain european subsidiaries are exempt from all or portions of normal statutory income tax rates we currently anticipate the favorable treatment for interest income dividends and export incentives to continue in the near term however this treatment is based on current law and tax rulings which could change including changes with respect to proposed treasury regulations under the tax act if finalized foreign exchange gainslosses have a 

permanent impact on our effective income tax rate that can cause unpredictable movement in our effective income tax rate we continue to maintain valuation allowances in various jurisdictions totaling 120 million  as of 2018 which could impact our effective income tax rate in the future we believe our effective income tax rate for 2019 will be approximately 20 

in 2016 the us treasury issued final section 385 debtequity regulations that impact our internal financings beginning in 2017 pursuant to a 2017 executive order the treasury department reviewed these regulations and determined that they should be retained subject to further review following the enactment of us tax reform we are awaiting the us treasury’s review of the existing section 385 debtequity regulations which could impact our internal financings in future years as well as any final regulations impacting interest deductions under the tax act 

2018— the 2018 effective income tax rate which was lower than the us statutory tax rate of 21 was favorably impacted by changes in unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions 60 and exempt income 56 these favorable items were partially offset by the effects of earnings in various countries notably in europe with higher statutory tax rates 17 and us state and local income taxes 10 

during 2018 we entered into various audit settlements impacting specific uncertain tax positions these audit settlements resulted in a 358 million  noncash benefit to our effective tax rate consisting of the recognition of 299 million  of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a reduction for tax positions of prior years and the release of 59 million  of previously accrued interest 

2017— the 2017 effective income tax rate which was lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35 was favorably impacted by the remeasurement of us net deferred tax liabilities due to the enactment of the tax act 149 exempt income 70 earnings in various countries notably in europe with lower statutory tax rates 30 and the us domestic production activity deduction 10 these favorable items were partially offset by the effects of us state and local income taxes 07 and changes in uncertain tax positions 05 although the tax act lowered the us statutory federal income tax rate to 21 for tax years beginning after 2017 the reconciliation uses the 35 rate in effect for the year ended december 31 2017 

2016— the 2016 effective income tax rate which was lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35 was favorably impacted by exempt income 67 earnings in various countries notably in europe with lower statutory tax rates 30 the impact of a change in nonus tax law on our deferred tax liabilities 10 and the us domestic production activity deduction 08 these favorable items were partially offset by the effects of noncash outofperiod adjustments 25 and us state and local income taxes 05 

our 2016 income tax provision included 135 million of noncash out of period adjustments from prior years for further information on these adjustments please see note 18  to our consolidated financial statements 

comprehensive income— we had comprehensive income of 4682 million  in 2018 5103 million  in 2017 and 3764 million  in 2016 

2018 versus 2017 — comprehensive income decreased by 421 million  in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to unfavorable net changes in foreign currency translations lower net income and defined pension and other postretirement benefits these decreases were offset by favorable impacts of financial derivatives primarily driven by periodic changes in benchmark interest rates 

the predominant functional currency for our operations outside of the us is the euro relative to the us dollar the value of the euro decreased during 2018 resulting in net losses as reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income these net losses include pretax gains of 124 million  in 2018  which represent the effective portion of our net investment hedges 

in 2018 the cumulative aftertax effect of our derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was a net gain of 54 million  the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro in 2018 and periodic changes in benchmark interest rates resulted in a pretax gain of 107 million  related to our crosscurrency swaps a 100 million  pretax loss related to our crosscurrency swaps represents reclassification adjustments included in other income net in 2018 in 2018 a pretax gain of 43 million  related to 

forwardstarting interest rate swaps was driven by changes in benchmark interest rates a 30 million  pretax gain related to our commodity hedges was also recognized in 2018 an 11 million  pretax loss related to our commodity hedges represents reclassification adjustments included in cost of sales in 2018 

we recognized defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit pretax losses of 41 million and 106 million in 2018 and 2017 respectively see note 16  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding net actuarial gains 

2017 versus 2016— the 1339 million increase in comprehensive income in 2017 relative to 2016 reflects higher net income the net favorable impacts of unrealized net changes in foreign currency translation adjustments and actuarial losses related to our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans these increases were offset by an unfavorable impact of financial derivative instruments recognized in 2017 

the predominant functional currency for our operations outside of the us is the euro relative to the us dollar the value of the euro increased during 2017 resulting in net gains as reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income these net gains in 2017 include pretax losses of 288 million which represent the effective portion of our net investment hedges 

we recognized net actuarial gains of 74 million in 2017 and net actuarial losses of 188 million in 2016 the 74 million net gain in 2017 reflects 74 million of gains due to changes in pension and other postretirement benefit discount rate assumptions and 6 million of gains due to favorable postretirement liability experience and other immaterial items these gains were partly offset by 7 million of losses due to pension asset experience actual asset return compared to expected return in 2016 the 188 million net loss was primarily attributable to 279 million of losses due to pension and other postretirement benefit discount rate decreases which was offset by 79 million of gains related to pension asset experience and 10 million due to favorable postretirement liability experience and other immaterial items in 2016 we also recognized a 61 million reclassification adjustment related primarily to a voluntary lump sum program offered to certain former employees in select us pension plans total lump sum payments from these plans exceeded annual service and interest cost in 2016 resulting in this loss 

the cumulative effects of our derivatives designated as cash flow hedges were losses of 323 million the euro strengthened against the us dollar in 2017 resulting in pretax losses of 287 million in 2017 related to our crosscurrency swaps pretax gains of 264 million related to our crosscurrency swaps were reclassification adjustments included in 2017 net income unrealized pretax losses of 25 million in 2017 related to forwardstarting interest rate swaps were driven by increases in benchmark interest rates during those periods 

segment analysis 

we use earnings before interest income taxes and depreciation and amortization “ebitda” as our measure of profitability for segment reporting purposes this measure of segment operating results is used by our chief operating decision maker to assess the performance of and allocate resources to our operating segments intersegment eliminations and items that are not directly related or allocated to business operations such as foreign exchange gains losses and components of pension and other postretirement benefit costs other than service cost are included in “other” for additional information related to our operating segments as well as a reconciliation of ebitda to its nearest generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” measure income from continuing operations before income taxes see note 22  segment and related information  to our consolidated financial statements 

following our acquisition of a schulman our continuing operations are managed through six reportable segments op–americas op–eai id aps refining and technology 

our new aps segment produces and markets compounding and solutions such as polypropylene compounds engineered plastics masterbatches engineered composites colors and powders and advanced polymers which includes catalloy  and polybutene1 polypropylene compounds catalloy  and polybutene1 were previously reported in our op–eai and op–americas segments accordingly the historical results of our op–eai and op–americas segments have been recast for all comparable periods presented for additional information related to our segments see note 3  business combination and dispositions  and note 22  segment and related information  to the consolidated financial statements the following tables reflect selected financial information for our reportable segments 





olefins and polyolefins–americas segment 

overview —in calculating the impact of margin and volume on ebitda consistent with industry practice management offsets revenues and volumes related to ethylene coproducts against the cost to produce ethylene volume and price impacts of ethylene coproducts are reported in margin ethylene is a major building block of olefins and polyolefins and as such ethylene sales volumes and prices and our internal cost of ethylene production are included in management’s assessment of the segment’s performance 

2018 versus 2017— ebitda declined in 2018 as lower ethylene margins more than offset the improvement in polyolefins margins relative to 2017  ebitda for 2017 also included a 31 million  gain resulting from the sale of property in lake charles louisiana 

2017 versus 2016— ebitda improved in 2017  due to higher olefins volumes stemming from the expansion of our corpus christi texas olefins facility in late 2016  higher olefins and polyethylene margins in 2017  were offset by lower polypropylene margins ebitda for 2017  was favorably impacted by the gain related to the sale of property in lake charles louisiana mentioned above ebitda for 2016  was also impacted by a 57 million  gain on the first quarter sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary and a 26 million  noncash lower of cost or market “lcm” inventory valuation charge recognized in the fourth quarter due primarily to a reduction in polypropylene prices 

ethylene raw materials —ethylene and its coproducts are produced from two major raw material groups 

 although prices of these raw materials are generally related to crude oil and natural gas prices during specific periods the relationships among these materials and benchmarks may vary significantly we have significant flexibility to vary the raw material mix and process conditions in our us olefins plants in order to maximize profitability as market prices for both feedstocks and products change 

as in recent years strong supplies from the us shale gasoil boom resulted in ethane being a preferred feedstock in our us plants in 2018 ethane remained the preferred us feedstock for ethylene despite higher recent prices driven by increased demand from newlyconstructed us olefins units and supply constraints in the gulf coast ngl fractionation and pipeline systems in 2018 we produced approximately 80  of our ethylene from ethane compared to approximately 75  and 70  in 2017  and 2016  respectively despite generally higher liquid feedstock prices strong propylene and butadiene coproduct prices at various points in the year also brought liquids into our feedslate 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the op–americas segment including income from equity investments which is a component of ebitda   



revenues —revenues increased by 404 million  or 4  in 2018  compared to 2017  and by 1282 million  or 15  in 2017  compared to 2016  

2018 versus 2017— average polyethylene and polypropylene sales prices supported globally by higher crude oil prices increased relative to 2017 this favorable impact was partly offset by a 6 cents  decline in ethylene prices resulting from increased supply driven by the startup of new us ethylene capacity the overall average increase in sales prices was responsible for an 8  increase in 2018 revenues 

segment volumes declined in 2018 mainly due to lower sales of purchased feedstock and the negative impact of planned and unplanned maintenance on polypropylene and polyethylene sales these lower sales volumes were responsible for a revenue decrease of 4  in 2018 

2017 versus 2016— average sales prices for most products increased in 2017  consistent with feedstock prices that are correlated with crude oil and natural gas prices which on average increased relative to 2016  these higher sales prices were responsible for a 14  increase in 2017  revenues 

operating rates and product volumes improved in 2017  due to turnaround activities and the expansion at our corpus christi texas facility during 2016  these increased volumes were responsible for a revenue increase of 1  in 2017  

ebitda —ebitda decreased by 137 million  or 5  in 2018  compared to 2017  and increased by 111 million  or 4  in 2017  compared to 2016  

2018 versus 2017 —lower olefins margins and higher fixed costs which were partly offset by higher polyethylene and polypropylene margins led to a 3  decline in 2018 ebitda ethylene margins decreased by 5 cents  per pound largely due to the decline in ethylene sales prices discussed above polyethylene and polypropylene margins reflect per pound increases in price spreads over ethylene and propylene of 7 cents  and 3 cents  respectively driven by higher sales prices and in the case of polyethylene also by the lower cost of ethylene feedstock the increase in polyethylene and polypropylene margins stem from strong demand and industry supply constraints lower polyethylene and polypropylene volumes also resulted in a 2  decline in 2018  ebitda an additional 1  decrease in ebitda relative to 2017 was related to the gain on the sale of property in lake charles louisiana 

the remaining change in 2018 ebitda was attributed to an increase in income from our equity investments 

2017 versus 2016 —increased volumes in 2017  due largely to the expansion of our corpus christi texas olefins facility was responsible for a 5  improvement in ebitda margins were relatively unchanged in 2017  compared to 2016  due to an approximate 4 cents  per pound decrease in polypropylene spreads that substantially offset per pound increases in olefins and polyethylene spreads of a half cent and 2 cents  respectively polypropylene margins declined from the high levels in 2016  on the higher cost of propylene feedstocks while the increase in olefins and polyethylene margins was attributable to higher average sales prices that more than offset the increased cost of ethylene lower income from our joint venture relative to the prior year led to a 1  decline in ebitda the net impact to ebitda of the gain on sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary in the first quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter lcm inventory valuation adjustment mentioned above was offset by the first quarter 2017 gain on sale of property in lake charles louisiana 

olefins and polyolefins–europe asia international segment 

overview — in calculating the impact of margin and volume on ebitda consistent with industry practice management offsets revenues and volumes related to ethylene coproducts against the cost to produce ethylene volume and price impacts of ethylene coproducts are reported in margin ethylene is a major building block of our olefins and polyolefins and as such ethylene sales volumes and prices and our internal cost of ethylene production are included in management’s assessment of the segment’s performance 

2018 versus 2017— ebitda in 2018  declined largely as a result of lower margins and volumes in europe compared to a strong 2017  ebitda for 2018 includes a 36 million  gain from the fourth quarter 2018  sale of our carbon black subsidiary in france in 2017  ebitda included a 108 million  gain on the third quarter 2017 sale of our 27 interest in geosel and the 21 million  beneficial impact related to the elimination of an obligation associated with a lease   

  2017 versus 2016— ebitda increased in 2017  compared to 2016  this improvement was driven by higher olefins margins and the impact of higher volumes across most products partly offset by lower polyethylene margins and lower income from our equity investments 

ebitda for 2017  also included the gain on the sale of our interest in geosel and the beneficial impact related to the elimination of an obligation associated with a lease discussed above in 2016  ebitda reflected gains totaling 11 million  from the sales of our joint venture in japan and idled assets in australia 

ethylene raw materials —in europe heavy liquids are the primary raw materials for our ethylene production in 2018  2017  and 2016  we continued to benefit by sourcing advantaged ngls as market opportunities arose 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the op–eai segment including income from equity investments which is a component of ebitda   



revenues —revenues in 2018  increased by 620 million  or 6  compared to 2017  and by 1500 million  or 17  in 2017  compared to 2016  

2018 versus 2017— average sales prices in 2018  were higher across most products as sales prices generally correlate with crude oil prices which were significantly higher compared to 2017  these higher average sales prices were responsible for a revenue increase of 7  in 2018  planned and unplanned maintenance a weaker market and low rhine river levels in the second half of 2018 compared to the prior year led to lower sales volumes across most products these decreased volumes resulted in a revenue decrease of 4  in 2018  foreign exchange impacts in 2018  which were favorable on average compared to 2017  led to a revenue increase of 3    

2017 versus 2016— average sales prices in 2017  were higher across most products as sales prices generally correlate with crude oil prices which on average increased compared to 2016  these higher average sales prices were responsible for a revenue increase of 12  in 2017  better product availability compared to 2016  which was affected by turnaround activity and inventory requirements led to higher sales volumes across most products these increased volumes resulted in a revenue increase of 3  in 2017  foreign exchange impacts that on average were favorable for 2017  resulted in a revenue increase of 2  compared to the prior year 

ebitda —ebitda decreased by 764 million  or 40  in 2018  compared to 2017  and increased by 198 million  or 11  in 2017  compared to 2016  

2018 versus 2017 —olefins and polyolefins margins in europe declined in 2018  olefins margins decreased as the improvement in ethylene prices lagged a 10 cents  per pound increase in the weighted average cost of ethylene production due to higher prices for naphtha and other olefin feedstocks a decline in 2018  polyolefins margins reflected lower per pound price spreads over ethylene and propylene of 3 cents  and 2 cents  respectively these lower margins were due to weaker supplydemand balances in europe and led to a decline in ebitda of 29  in comparison to a strong 2017  the impact of the lower volumes discussed above also led to a 9  decrease in 2018  ebitda a reduction in income from our equity investments resulted in an additional 2  decrease in ebitda relative to 2017  the net impact of the 2018  gain on the sale of our carbon black subsidiary in france and the 2017  benefits related to the sale of our interest in geosel and the elimination of an obligation associated with a lease discussed above resulted in a further 5  decline in ebitda 

these unfavorable impacts were offset in part by a 5  increase to ebitda due to favorable foreign exchange impacts in 2018  

2017 versus 2016 —an increase in olefin margins driven largely by a 6 cents per pound increase in ethylene sales prices was partly offset in 2017  by a 3 cents per pound decrease in european polyethylene spreads due to a more balanced european market compared to the prior year this net increase resulted in a 1  improvement in 2017  ebitda compared to 2016  the higher 2017  volumes discussed above added another 5  to ebitda favorable foreign exchange impacts in 2017  also contributed an additional 1  to ebitda the net beneficial impact of the transactions in 2016  and 2017  discussed above related to the sales of our joint venture interests and idled assets and the elimination of a leaserelated obligation resulted in an additional 6  increase in ebitda these increases were partially offset by a 2  decrease in ebitda driven by a reduction in income from equity investments in poland and asia in 2017  relative to very strong 2016  results 

intermediates and derivatives segment 

overview— ebitda for our id segment was higher across all businesses in 2018 compared to 2017 which included an approximate  50 million  unfavorable impact related to precious metal catalysts 

2018 versus 2017— ebitda improved in 2018 relative to 2017 as higher margins across most products benefited from industry supply constraints and strong demand 

2017 versus 2016— ebitda was higher for our id segment in 2017 relative to 2016 due to stronger margins for intermediate chemicals products supported by reduced market supply stemming from industry outages and increased demand in asia 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the id segment including income from equity investments which is a component of ebitda 



revenues —revenues for 2018 increased by  1116 million  or 13  compared to 2017 and increased by 1246 million or 17 in 2017 compared to 2016 

2018 versus 2017— higher average sales prices in 2018 for most products which reflect the impacts of higher feedstock and energy costs and industry supply constraints were responsible for a revenue increase of 10  higher sales volumes resulted in a revenue increase of 2  in 2018 primarily due to hurricane harvey impacts and major turnarounds at our botlek netherlands and channelview texas facilities in 2017 foreign exchange impacts that on average were favorably higher relative to 2017 resulted in a revenue increase of 1  

2017 versus 2016— higher average sales prices in 2017 for most products which reflect the impacts of higher feedstock and energy costs and industry supply constraints were responsible for a revenue increase of 17 favorable foreign exchange impacts also led to a 1 revenue increase in 2017 these increases were partially offset by a revenue decrease of 1 in 2017 primarily due to lower sales volumes for intermediate chemicals and oxyfuels and related products this volumedriven decline was largely due to reduced production associated with two major turnarounds at our botlek netherlands and channelview texas facilities 

ebitda —ebitda increased by  521 million  or 35  in 2018 compared to 2017 and increased by 157 million or 12 in 2017 compared to 2016 

2018 versus 2017— higher margins were responsible for an improvement in ebitda of 27  in 2018 relative to 2017 industry outages and other supply constraints for several intermediate chemicals products along with strong demand for po and derivatives products led to tight supplies and higher sales prices intermediate chemicals products accounted for approximately two thirds  of the margin improvement in 2018 as most intermediate chemical products benefited from lower ethylene raw material costs and tight industry supply po and derivatives and oxyfuels and related products each accounted for approximately half of the remaining increase in 2018 margins margins for oxyfuels and related products improved with higher crude oil pricing which outpaced butane 

the impact of higher volumes as discussed above added 3  to ebitda in 2018 while favorable foreign exchange impacts added 2  an additional 3  increase in ebitda as compared to the prior year period stems from the absence of the unfavorable impact associated with precious metal catalysts in 2017 

2017 versus 2016— higher intermediate chemicals and po and derivative product margins driven by higher average sales prices resulted in a 19 increase in ebitda this increase was offset in part by a 2 decline in margins for oxyfuels and related products primarily due to higher butane pricing this margin improvement was partly offset by decreases in ebitda of 4 and 1 respectively stemming from the unfavorable impacts associated with charges related to precious metals catalyst financings and the lower volumes discussed above 

advanced polymer solutions segment 

overview   

2018 versus 2017— ebitda for our aps segment declined relative to 2017  as lower margins and 69 million  of acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs were offset by 58 million  of ebitda stemming from the acquisition of a schulman   

2017 versus 2016— ebitda improved slightly in 2017 with higher compounding and solutions volumes and improved advanced polymers margins relative to 2016 which included a 21 million gain on the sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the aps segment including income from equity investments which is a component of ebitda 

revenues —revenues increased in 2018  by 1102 million  or 38  compared to 2017  and by 321 million  or 12  in 2017  compared to 2016  

2018 versus 2017— the acquisition of a schulman contributed 846 million  to revenues of the aps segment which accounts for a revenue increase in 2018  of approximately 29  relative to 2017  higher average sales prices which were driven by the increased cost of raw materials also led to a revenue increase of 8  in 2018  foreign exchange impacts which on average were favorable in 2018 also resulted in a revenue increase of 2  

a decline in compounding and solutions product volumes in 2018  stemming from lower automotive production in europe was substantially offset by higher advanced polymers product volumes due to strong demand in europe and north america leading to a 1  decline in revenues 

2017 versus 2016 —higher average sales prices across all products in 2017  led to a revenue increase of 8  relative to 2016  an increase in 2017  compounding and solutions volumes driven by higher automotive demand in south america   resulted in a 3  revenue increase another 1  increase in revenues stemmed from foreign exchange impacts which on average were favorable in 2017  relative to 2016  

 ebitda —ebitda decreased in 2018  by 38 million  or 9  compared to 2017  and increased by 11 million  or 3  in 2017  compared to 2016  

2018 versus 2017— ebitda declined by 16  in 2018  as a result of the 69 million  of costs associated with the acquisition and integration of a schulman the operations of a schulman following the acquisition contributed 58 million  of ebitda to the results of the aps segment leading to an increase in ebitda of 13  

margins for compounding and solutions products declined in 2018  due primarily to increases in raw material costs in south america and asia that outpaced increases in average sales prices these lower margins and the decline in volumes discussed above resulted in decreases of 8  and 1  respectively in ebitda 

favorable foreign exchange impacts partly offset these declines with a 3  increase in 2018  ebitda 

2017 versus 2016 —the volumedriven increase related to our compounding and solutions products discussed above led to a 4  increase in 2018  ebitda increased margins for advanced polymers driven by sales prices that increased more than raw material prices resulted in an additional increase in ebitda of 3  favorable foreign exchange impacts in 2017  contributed another 1  to ebitda these favorable impacts were offset in part by a 5  decline relative to ebitda in 2016  which included the gain on sale of our argentine subsidiary discussed above 

refining segment 

overview 

2018 versus 2017— ebitda for our refining segment benefited in 2018 from improved refining margins primarily driven by favorable crude oil discounts in western canadian select and improved rates on our fluid catalytic converter leading to better yields 

2017 versus 2016— ebitda benefited from higher crude processing rates in 2017 as the impacts of planned and unplanned maintenance outages were less than in 2016 higher industry margins were offset by higher maintenancerelated fixed costs in 2017 

the following table sets forth selected financial information and heavy crude processing rates for the refining segment and the us refining market margins for the applicable periods “lls” is a light crude oil while “maya” is a heavy crude oil 



revenues —revenues increased by 2309 million  or 34  in 2018 compared to 2017 and by 1713 million or 33 in 2017 compared to 2016 

2018 versus 2017— higher product prices led to a revenue increase of 26  relative to 2017 due to a per barrel increase in average crude oil prices of approximately 16  in 2018 heavy crude oil processing rates in 2018 decreased 2  relative to 2017 with both comparative periods impacted by turnaround activity sales volumes increased in 2018 leading to a revenue increase of 8  compared to the 2017 period due to an increase in downstream processing of intermediate oils 

2017 versus 2016— higher product prices in 2017 largely driven by an increase in average crude oil prices of approximately 10 per barrel led to a revenue increase of 26 relative to 2016 heavy crude oil processing rates increased by 17 in 2017 leading to a volume driven revenue increase of 7 as the impacts of planned and unplanned outages and the effects of hurricane harvey in 2017 had less of an impact on processing rates than the unplanned outages in 2016 related to a 

coker fire downtime at crude units with reduced processing and several utility interruptions in 2017 we completed planned turnarounds on one of our crude units and our fluid catalytic converter 

ebitda —ebitda increased by 10 million  or 6  in 2018 compared to 2017 and by 85 million or 118 in 2017 compared to 2016 

2018 versus 2017— advantaged pricing for canadian crude oil and better yields   equally contributed to the improvement in 2018 refining margins relative to 2017 which was negatively impacted by planned turnaround activity on our fluid catalytic cracking unit these higher margins accounted for a   12   improvement in 2018 ebitda these margin improvements were offset by a   2  decrease in heavy crude oil processing rates which resulted in a volumedriven   6   decrease in ebitda  

2017 versus 2016— increased production accounted for approximately 90 of the improvement in 2017 ebitda crude oil processing rates in 2017 were higher than 2016 as discussed above higher refining margins which were partly offset by higher maintenancerelated fixed costs accounted for the remaining 10 improvement in 2017 ebitda 

technology segment 

overview —the technology segment recognizes revenues related to the sale of polyolefin catalysts and the licensing of chemical and polyolefin process technologies these revenues are offset in part by the costs incurred in the production of catalysts licensing and services activities and research and development “rd” activities in 2018  2017  and 2016  our technology segment incurred approximately 55  of all rd costs 

2018 versus 2017— ebitda improved in 2018  primarily due to higher licensing revenues   

2017 versus 2016— a decline in 2017  ebitda reflects lower licensing revenues partially offset by higher catalyst sales volumes compared to 2016  

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the technology segment 



revenues —revenues increased by 133 million  or 30  in 2018  compared to 2017  and decreased by 29 million  or 6  in 2017  compared to 2016  

2018 versus 2017— higher licensing revenues were responsible for a revenue increase of 23  in 2018  relative to the corresponding period in 2017  higher customer demand led to increased catalyst volumes in 2018  resulting in a revenue increase of 3  favorable foreign exchange impacts in 2018  led to an additional revenue increase of 4  

2017 versus 2016— lower licensing revenues were responsible for a revenue decrease of 12  in 2017  relative to 2016  this decrease was partially offset by revenue increases of 3  and 1  respectively related to increased catalyst sales volumes and higher average sales prices favorable foreign exchange impacts were responsible for an additional 2  increase in ebitda 

ebitda —ebitda in 2018  increased by 105 million  or 47  compared to 2017  and decreased by 39 million  or 15  in 2017  compared to 2016  

2018 versus 2017— higher licensing revenues resulted in ebitda improvements of 38  in 2018  the catalyst sales volume increase in 2018  discussed above was responsible for a 5  increase in ebitda the remaining 4  increase in 2018  ebitda was due to favorable foreign exchange impacts 

2017 versus 2016— lower licensing revenues were largely responsible for a 20  decrease in 2017  ebitda this decline was partly offset by a 5  improvement in ebitda resulting from an increase in catalyst volumes during 2017  

financial condition 

operating investing and financing activities of continuing operations which are discussed below are presented in the following table 

operating activities —cash of 5471 million  generated by operating activities in 2018 reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items and net cash provided by the main components of working capital–accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable a 358 million  noncash reduction in unrecognized tax benefits is reflected in other operating activities in 2018 for additional information on this matter see note 18  to the consolidated financial statements 

in 2018 the main components of working capital provided 93 million  of cash lower accounts receivable due primarily to lower sales volumes in our op–americas op–eai and id segments at year end and higher accounts payable due to higher feedstock prices were partially offset by an increase in inventory primarily due to the lower sales volumes at year end 

cash of 5206 million generated in 2017 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items partly offset by 593 million of cash used by the main components of working capital higher sales prices across all of our segments in the fourth quarter of 2017 and brief delays in the receipt of payments for products in our refining and id segments led to the increase in accounts receivable inventories increased for most products in our op–eai and op–americas segments and included an inventory build in our op–americas segment in anticipation of first quarter 2018 turnaround activities these increases were partly offset by an increase in feedstock prices in the fourth quarter of 2017 in our op–americas op–eai and refining segments which led to an increase in accounts payable 

cash of 5606 million generated in 2016 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items and cash generated by the main components of working capital the noncash items in 2016 included a 78 million gain related to the sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary with adjustments for related working capital and gains totaling 11 million related to sales of our joint venture in japan and idled assets in australia 

the main components of working capital generated cash of 123 million in 2016 higher product sales prices in the fourth quarter of 2016 across all segments combined with the impact of higher fourth quarter 2016 sales volumes in our op–americas refining and id segments led to an increase in accounts receivable this increase in accounts receivable was offset by higher accounts payable which was driven by the higher prices of crude oil and other feedstocks the level of inventories fell in our op–americas segment following the completion of turnaround activities in the fourth quarter of 2016 and in our refining segment which had higher crude oil inventories at the end of 2015 due to operational issues during the fourth quarter 

investing activities —we invested cash of 3559 million  1756 million and 2301 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

in august 2018 we acquired a schulman for 1776 million  which is net of 81 million of cash acquired and a liability deemed as a component of the purchase price for additional information on this transaction see note 3  to the consolidated financial statements 

we invest cash in investmentgrade and other highquality instruments that provide adequate flexibility to redeploy funds as needed to meet our cash flow requirements while maximizing yield 

in 2018 2017 and 2016 we invested 50 million  653 million  and 688 million respectively in debt securities that are deemed availableforsale we also invested 64 million  in equity securities in 2018 and 76 million in heldtomaturity 

securities in 2016 these investments are classified as shortterm investments in 2017 and 2016 we invested 512 million  and 674 million  respectively in triparty repurchase agreements

joint venture activity— in september 2017 we sold our 27 interest in our geosel joint venture and received proceeds of 155 million 

financial instruments activity— upon expiration in 2018 2017 and 2016 we settled foreign currency contracts with notional values totaling €925 million €550 million and €1200 million respectively which were designated as net investment hedges of our investments in foreign subsidiaries payments to and proceeds from our counterparties resulted in a net cash inflow of 30 million  in 2018 and net cash outflows of 49 million and 61 million during 2017 and 2016 respectively see note 15  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these foreign currency contracts 

sales of subsidiaries— in october 2018 we received net cash proceeds of 37 million  for the sale of our carbon black subsidiary in france 

in february 2016 we received net cash proceeds of 137 million for the sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary 

the following table summarizes our capital expenditures for continuing operations for the periods from 2016 through 2018 

in 2019 we expect to spend approximately 28 billion for capital expenditures and contributions to our po joint ventures the higher levels of expected capital expenditures in 2019 and 2018 relative to their respective comparative periods are largely driven by construction related to our new hyperzone polyethylene plant at our la porte texas facility and for the construction related to our new potba plant in texas 

financing activities —financing activities used cash of 3008 million  2859 million and 3349 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

we made payments totaling 1854 million  866 million and 2938 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively to repurchase a portion of our outstanding ordinary shares we also made dividend payments to holders of our ordinary shares totaling 1554 million  1415 million and 1395 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively for additional information related to these share repurchases and dividend payments see note 20  to the consolidated financial statements

in march 2016 we issued €750 million of 1875 guaranteed notes due 2022 and received net proceeds of 812 million 

through the issuance and repurchase of commercial paper instruments under our commercial paper program we received net proceeds of 810 million  and 177 million in 2018 and 2016 respectively we made net repayments of 493 million in 2017 

additional information related to our commercial paper program and the issuance and repayment of debt can be found in the liquidity and capital resources section below and in note 13  to the consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources —as of december 31 2018  we had 1224 million  of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities classified as shortterm investments we also held 544 million  of triparty repurchase agreements classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets at december 31 2018 for additional information related to our purchases of marketable securities which currently include time deposits certificates of deposit commercial paper bonds and limited partnership investments and our investments in triparty repurchase agreements see “investing activities” above and note 15  to the consolidated financial statements 

at december 31 2018 we held 269 million  of cash in jurisdictions outside the us principally europe and asia there are currently no material legal or economic restrictions that would impede our transfers of cash 

we also had total unused availability under our credit facilities of 2517 million  at december 31 2018 which included the following 

 at december 31 2018 we had total debt including current maturities of 9387 million  and 214 million  of outstanding letters of credit bank guarantees and surety bonds issued under uncommitted credit facilities 

in february 2019 lyb americas finance company llc “lyb americas finance  a direct 100 owned finance subsidiary of lyondellbasell industries nv entered into a 364day 2000 million senior unsecured term loan credit facility and borrowed the entire amount the proceeds of this term loan which is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by lyondellbasell industries nv are intended for general corporate purposes including the repayment of debt 

borrowings under the credit agreement will bear interest at either a libor rate or a base rate as defined plus in each case an applicable margin determined by reference to lyondellbasell nv’s current credit ratings 

the credit agreement contains customary covenants and warranties including specified restrictions on indebtedness including secured and subsidiary indebtedness and merger and sales of assets in addition we are required to maintain a leverage ratio at the end of every fiscal quarter of 350 to 100 or less 

in february 2019 proceeds from the credit facility were used to redeem the remaining 1000 million outstanding of our 5 senior notes due 2019 at par in conjunction with the redemption of these notes we recognized noncash charges of less than 1 million for the writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs and 8 million  for the writeoff of the cumulative fair value hedge accounting adjustment related to the redeemed notes 

in july 2018 we amended our 900 million  us accounts receivable facility this amendment among other things extended the term of the facility to july 2021 

for additional information related to our credit facilities discussed above see note 13  to the consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with our current interest rate risk management strategy and subject to management’s evaluation of market conditions and the availability of favorable interest rates among other factors we may from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements to economically convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to variable rate debt or convert a portion of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 

in 2018  our shareholders approved a proposal to authorize us to repurchase up to an additional 10 or 57844016  of our ordinary shares through december 2019 “2018 share repurchase program” as a result the authorization of the remaining unpurchased shares under the share repurchase program approved by our shareholders in may 2017 “2017 share repurchase program” was superseded our share repurchase program does not have a stated dollar amount and purchases may be made through open market purchases private market transactions or other structured transactions repurchased shares could be retired or used for general corporate purposes including for various employee benefit and compensation plans in 2018 we purchased approximately 19 million  shares under these programs for approximately 1878 million  as of february 19 2019  we had approximately 38 million  shares remaining under the current authorization the timing and amounts of additional shares repurchased will be determined based on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors for additional information related to our share repurchase programs see note 20  to the consolidated financial statements 

we may repay or redeem our debt including purchases of our outstanding bonds in the open market using cash and cash equivalents cash from our shortterm investments and triparty repurchase agreements cash from operating activities proceeds from the issuance of debt proceeds from asset divestitures or a combination thereof in connection with any repayment or redemption of our debt we may incur cash and noncash charges which could be material in the period in which they are incurred 

construction of our hyperzone  high density polyethylene plant at our la porte texas site which commenced in may 2017 is on track for planned startup in the third quarter of 2019 

in july 2017  we announced our final investment decision to build a worldscale potba plant in texas with a capacity of 10 billion  pounds of po and 22 billion  pounds of tba in august 2018 we broke ground on this project which is estimated to cost approximately 24 billion  we anticipate the project to be completed in the third quarter of 2021 

we plan to fund our ongoing working capital capital expenditures debt service and other funding requirements with cash from operating activities which could be affected by general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory business and other factors many of which are beyond our control cash and cash equivalents cash from our shortterm investments and triparty repurchase agreements cash from operating activities proceeds from the issuance of debt or a combination thereof may be used to fund the purchase of shares under our share repurchase program 

we intend to continue to declare and pay quarterly dividends with the goal of increasing the dividend over time after giving consideration to our cash balances and expected results from operations 

we believe that our current liquidity availability and cash from operating activities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due 

contractual and other obligations —the following table summarizes as of december 31 2018  our minimum payments for longterm debt including current maturities shortterm debt and contractual and other obligations for the next five years and thereafter 

  

total debt —our debt includes unsecured senior notes guaranteed notes and various other us and nonus loans see note 13  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of covenant requirements under the credit facilities and indentures and additional information regarding our debt facilities 

interest on total debt —our debt and related party debt agreements contain provisions for the payment of monthly quarterly or semiannual interest at a stated rate of interest over the term of the debt 

pension and other postretirement benefits —we maintain several defined benefit pension plans as described in note 16  to the consolidated financial statements many of our us and nonus plans are subject to minimum funding requirements however the amounts of required future contributions for all our plans are not fixed and can vary significantly due to changes in economic assumptions liability experience and investment return on plan assets as a result we have excluded pension and other postretirement benefit obligations from the contractual and other obligations table above our annual contributions may include amounts in excess of minimum required funding levels contributions to our nonus plans in years beyond 2019  are not expected to be materially different than the expected 2019  contributions disclosed in note 16  to the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2018  the projected benefit obligation for our pension plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by 992 million  subject to future actuarial gains and losses as well as future asset earnings we together with our consolidated subsidiaries will be required to fund the discounted obligation of 992 million  in future years we contributed 100 million  103 million and 114 million to our pension plans in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively we provide other postretirement benefits primarily medical benefits to eligible participants as described in note 16  to the consolidated financial statements we pay other unfunded postretirement benefits as incurred 

contract liabilities —we are obligated to deliver products or services in connection with sales agreements under which customer payments were received before transfer of control to the customers occurs these contract liabilities will be recognized in earnings when control of the product or service is transferred to the customer which range predominantly from 1  to 15  years the unamortized longterm portion of such advances totaled 10 million  as of december 31 2018  

other —other primarily consists of accruals for environmental remediation costs obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and anticipated asset retirement obligations see “critical accounting policies” below for a discussion of obligations for environmental remediation costs 

deferred income taxes —the scheduled settlement of the deferred tax liabilities shown in the table is based on the scheduled reversal of the underlying temporary differences actual cash tax payments will vary depending upon future taxable income see note 18  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our deferred tax liabilities 

purchase obligations —we are party to various obligations to purchase products and services principally for raw materials utilities and industrial gases these commitments are designed to assure sources of supply and are not expected to be in excess of normal requirements the commitments are segregated into takeorpay contracts and other contracts under the takeorpay contracts we are obligated to make minimum payments whether or not we take the product or service other contracts include contracts that specify minimum quantities however in the event that we do not take the contractual minimum we are only obligated for any resulting economic loss suffered by the vendor the payments shown for the other contracts assume that minimum quantities are purchased for contracts with variable pricing terms the minimum payments reflect the contract price at december 31 2018  

operating leases —we lease various facilities and equipment under noncancelable lease arrangements for various periods see note 14  to the consolidated financial statements for related lease disclosures 

current business outlook 

during the first month of 2019 we have seen normalization of markets with increased polymer demand we expect our growth to accelerate in 2019 with the planned startup of our new hyperzone  polyethylene plant in the third quarter and continued construction of our new potba plant which is on track for completion in 2021 global polyethylene capacity additions are expected to moderate during 2019 and 2020 providing support for high industry operating rates and ethylene chain profitability 

related party transactions 

we have related party transactions with our joint venture partners we believe that such transactions are effected on terms substantially no more or less favorable than those that would have been agreed upon by unrelated parties on an arm’s length basis see note 5  to the consolidated financial statements for additional related party disclosures 

critical accounting policies 

management applies those accounting policies that it believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the us see note 2  to the consolidated financial statements our more critical accounting policies include those related to the valuation of inventory longlived assets the valuation of goodwill accruals for longterm employee benefit costs such as pension and other postretirement costs and accruals for taxes based on income inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management management periodically updates its estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment 

inventory —we account for our inventory using the lastin firstout “lifo” method of accounting 

the cost of raw materials which represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses and energy costs generally follow price trends for crude oil andor natural gas crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to many factors including changes in economic conditions 

since our inventory consists of manufactured products derived from crude oil natural gas natural gas liquids and correlated materials as well as the associated feedstocks and intermediate chemicals our inventory market values are generally influenced by changes in benchmark crude oil and heavy liquid values and prices for manufactured finished goods the degree of influence of a particular benchmark may vary from period to period as the composition of the dollar value lifo pools change due to natural inventory composition changes variation in pricing from period to period does not necessarily result in a linear lower of cost or market “lcm” impact additionally an lcm condition may arise due to a volumetric decline in a particular material that had previously provided a positive impact within a pool as a result market valuations and lcm conditions are dependent upon the composition and mix of materials on hand at the balance sheet date in the measurement of 

an lcm adjustment the numeric input value for determining the crude oil market price includes pricing that is weighted by volume of inventories held at a point in time including wti brent and maya crude oils 

as indicated above fluctuation in the prices of crude oil natural gas and correlated products from period to period may result in the recognition of charges to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in periods of falling prices and the reversal of those charges in subsequent interim periods as market prices recover accordingly our cost of sales and results of operations may be affected by such fluctuations 

while prices for our products and raw materials are inherently volatile and therefore no prediction can be given with certainty we do not believe any of our inventory is at risk for impairment at this time 

goodwill —as of december 31 2018 we recognized 1814 million  of goodwill of this amount 1271 million  was recognized as a result of the acquisition of a schulman which mainly relates to acquired workforce and synergies expected from the acquisition all of the goodwill was assigned to our aps segment the remaining goodwill at december 31 2018  primarily represents the tax effect of the differences between the tax and book bases of our assets and liabilities resulting from the revaluation of those assets and liabilities to fair value in connection with the company’s emergence from bankruptcy and freshstart accounting we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill of a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable 

additional information on the amount of goodwill allocated to our reporting units appears in note 3  and note 22  to the consolidated financial statements 

we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors assessed for each of the reporting units include but are not limited to changes in longterm commodity prices discount rates competitive environments planned capacity cost factors such as raw material prices and financial performance of the reporting units if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a quantitative test is required 

we also have the option to proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test under the quantitative impairment test the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill for the quantitative impairment test the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated using a discounted cashflow model such a model inherently utilizes a significant number of estimates and assumptions including operating margins tax rates discount rates capital expenditures and working capital changes if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value an impairment charge equal to the excess would be recognized up to a maximum amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

for 2018  and 2017  management performed a qualitative impairment assessment of our reporting units which indicated that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their carrying value accordingly a quantitative goodwill impairment test was not required accordingly no goodwill impairment was recognized in 2018  or 2017  

longterm employee benefit costs —our costs for longterm employee benefits particularly pension and other postretirement medical and life insurance benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is management’s responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent its best estimates of the future effects of those uncertainties it also is management’s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 

the current benefit service costs as well as the existing liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis the discount rate is a current rate related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled our assumed discount rate is based on yield information for highquality corporate bonds with durations comparable to the expected cash settlement of our obligations for the purpose of measuring the benefit obligations at december 31 2018  we used a weighted average discount rate of 451  for the us plans which reflects the different terms of the related benefit obligations the weighted average discount rate used to measure obligations for nonus plans at december 31 2018  was 

207  reflecting market interest rates the discount rates in effect at december 31 2018  will be used to measure net periodic benefit cost during 2019  

the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of other postretirement medical benefits are also measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits as of december 31 2018  the assumed rate of increase for our us plans was 64  decreasing to 45  in 2038  and thereafter a one hundred basis point change in the health care cost trend rate assumption as of december 31 2018  would have resulted in a 17 million  increase or 12 million  decrease in the accumulated other postretirement benefit liability for our nonus plans and would have resulted in an increase or decrease of less than 1 million for us plans due to limits on our maximum contribution level under the medical plan there would have been no significant effect on either our benefit liability or net periodic cost 

the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption investment returns that are recognized currently in net income represent the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets applied to a marketrelated value of plan assets which for us is defined as the market value of assets the expected rate of return on plan assets is a longerterm rate and is expected to change less frequently than the current assumed discount rate reflecting longterm market expectations rather than current fluctuations in market conditions 

the weighted average expected longterm rate of return on assets in our us plans of 750  is based on the average level of earnings that our independent pension investment advisor had advised could be expected to be earned over time and 292  for our nonus plan assets is based on an expectation and asset allocation that varies by region the asset allocations are summarized in note 16  to the consolidated financial statements the actual returns in 2018  was a loss  of 191  and gain  of 089  for our us and nonus plan assets respectively 

the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets management’s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 

net periodic pension cost recognized each year includes the expected asset earnings rather than the actual earnings or loss along with other gains and losses this unrecognized amount to the extent it cumulatively exceeds 10 of the projected benefit obligation for the respective plan is recognized as additional net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service period of the participants in each plan 

the following table reflects the sensitivity of the benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans to changes in the actuarial assumptions 



the sensitivity of our postretirement benefit plans obligations and net periodic benefit costs to changes in actuarial assumptions are reflected in the following table 



additional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in note 16  to the consolidated financial statements 

accruals for taxes based on income —the determination of our provision for income taxes and the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities is subject to management’s estimates and judgments due to the complexity of the tax laws and regulations in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of these complex laws and regulations 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse at december 31 2017 the measurement of our deferred tax balances was materially affected by the us enactment of “hr1” also known as the tax act as explained in note 18  to the consolidated financial statements 

we recognize future tax benefits to the extent that the realization of these benefits is more likely than not our current provision for income taxes is impacted by the recognition and release of valuation allowances related to net deferred assets in certain jurisdictions further changes to these valuation allowances may impact our future provision for income taxes which will include no tax benefit with respect to losses incurred and no tax expense with respect to income generated in these countries until the respective valuation allowance is eliminated 

we recognize the financial statement benefits with respect to an uncertain income tax position that we have taken or may take on an income tax return when we believe it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

see note 15  to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of lyondellbasell industries nv’s management of commodity price risk foreign currency exposure and interest rate risk through its use of derivative instruments and hedging activities 

commodity price risk 

a substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change accordingly product margins and the level of our profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in 

the business cycle natural gas crude oil and refined products along with feedstocks for ethylene and propylene production constitutes the main commodity exposures we try to protect against such instability through various business strategies including provisions in sales contracts which allows us to pass on higher raw material costs to our customers through timely price increases and through the use of commodity swap and futures contracts 

we use value at risk “var” stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes var estimates the maximum potential loss in fair market values for our commodity derivative instruments given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time using specified confidence levels utilizing a monte carlo simulation with a 95 percent confidence level over a 3day time horizon the effect on our pretax income and cash flows for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 would be immaterial 

foreign exchange risk 

we manufacture and market our products in many countries throughout the world and as a result are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

a significant portion of our reporting entities use the euro as their functional currency our reporting currency is the us dollar the translation gains or losses that result from the process of translating the euro denominated financial statements to us dollars are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” until such time as those entities may be liquidated or sold changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro can therefore have a significant impact on comprehensive income 

we have entered into hedging arrangements designated as net investment hedges to reduce the volatility in stockholders’ equity resulting from foreign currency fluctuation associated with our net investments in foreign operations the table below illustrates the impact on other comprehensive loss of a 10 fluctuation in the foreign currency rate associated with each net investment hedge and the euribor and libor rates associated with basis swaps are shown in the table below 



some of our operations enter into transactions that are not denominated in their functional currency this results in exposure to foreign currency risk for financial instruments including but not limited to third party and intercompany receivables and payables and intercompany loans 

we maintain risk management control practices to monitor the foreign currency risk attributable to our intercompany and third party outstanding foreign currency balances these practices involve the centralization of our exposure to underlying currencies that are not subject to central bank andor country specific restrictions by centralizing most of our foreign currency exposure into one subsidiary we are able to take advantage of any natural offsets thereby reducing the overall impact of changes in foreign currency rates on our earnings at december 31 2018 a 10 fluctuation compared to the us dollar in the underlying currencies that have no central bank or other currency restrictions related to nonhedged monetary net assets would have had a resulting additional impact to earnings of approximately 3 million 

our policy is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies to minimize exchange gains and losses arising from changes in exchange rates to minimize the effects of our net currency exchange exposures we enter into foreign currency spot and forward contracts and in some cases crosscurrency swaps 

we also engage in shortterm foreign exchange swaps in order to roll certain hedge positions and to make funds available for intercompany financing our net position in foreign currencies is monitored daily 

we have entered into 2300 million of noncancellable crosscurrency swaps which we designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges to reduce the variability in the functional currency equivalent cash flows of certain foreign currency denominated intercompany notes at december 31 2018 these foreign currency contracts have maturity dates ranging from 2021 to 2027 and their fair value was a net asset of 96 million a 10 fluctuation compared to the us dollar would have had a resulting additional impact to other comprehensive loss of approximately 243 million 

other income net in the consolidated statements of income reflected net exchange rate foreign currency gains  of 24 million  in 2018  and foreign currency losses of 1 million  in 2017  and 4 million  in 2016  for forward contracts including swap transactions that economically hedge recognized monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies no hedge accounting is applied changes in the fair value of foreign currency forward and swap contracts are reported in the consolidated statements of income and offset the currency exchange results recognized on the assets and liabilities at december 31 2018 these foreign currency contracts which will mature between january 2019 and august 2019 inclusively had an aggregated notional amount of 1764 million and the fair value was a net liability of 4 million a 10 fluctuation compared to the us dollar would have had a resulting additional impact to earnings of approximately 96 million 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk management is viewed as a tradeoff between cost and risk the cost of interest is generally lower for shortterm debt and higher for longterm debt and lower for floating rate debt and higher for fixed rate debt however the risk associated with interest rates is inversely related to the cost with shortterm debt carrying a higher refinancing risk and floating rate debt having higher interest rate volatility our interest rate risk management strategy attempts to optimize this costriskreward tradeoff 

we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our fixed and variable rate debt fluctuations in interest rates impact the fair value of fixedrate debt as well as pretax earnings stemming from interest expense on variablerate debt to minimize earnings at risk as part of our interest rate risk management strategy we target to maintain floating rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps equal to our cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and triparty repurchase agreements as those assets are invested in floating rate instruments 

preissuance interest rate —a preissuance interest rate strategy is utilized to mitigate the risk that benchmark interest rates ie us treasury midswaps etc will increase between the time a decision has been made to issue debt and when the actual debt offering is issued in 2015 and 2018 we entered into forwardstarting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of adverse changes in the benchmark interest rates on the anticipated refinancing of our senior notes due 2019 and 2021 respectively these interest rate swaps will be terminated upon debt issuance at december 31 2018 the total notional amount of these interest rate contracts designated as cash flow hedges was 1000 million and 500 million respectively and their fair values were a net asset of 7 million and net liability of 5 million respectively we estimate that a 10 change in market interest rates as of december 31 2018 would change the fair value of our forwardstarting interest rate swaps outstanding and would have had a resulting impact on other comprehensive loss of approximately 71 million 

fixedrate debt —we enter into interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy at december 31 2018 the total notional amount of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges which have maturity dates ranging from 2019 to 2027 was 3143 million and their fair value was a net liability of 42 million 

at december 31 2018 after giving consideration to the 3143 million of fixedrate debt that we have effectively converted to floating through these us dollar fixedforfloating interest rate swaps approximately 58 of our debt portfolio on a gross basis incurred interest at a fixedrate and the remaining 42 of the portfolio incurred interest at a variablerate we estimate that a 10 change in market interest rates as of december 31 2018 would change the fair value of our interest rate swaps outstanding and would have had a resulting impact on our pretax income of approximately 26 million 

variablerate debt —our variable rate debt consists of our 2500 million senior revolving credit facility our 900 million us receivables securitization facility and our commercial paper program at december 31 2018 there were no outstanding borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility nor us receivables securitization facility our commercial paper program had outstanding borrowings of 809 million at december 31 2018 we estimate that a 10 change in interest rates would have had a 2 million impact on earnings based on our average variablerate debt outstanding per year

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

overview 

lyondellbasell industries nv is a global independent chemical company and was incorporated under dutch law on october 15 2009 unless otherwise indicated the “company” “we” “our” “us” and “lyondellbasell” are used in this report to refer to the businesses of lyondellbasell industries nv and its consolidated subsidiaries we are one of the world’s top independent chemical companies based on revenues 

we participate globally across the petrochemical value chain and are an industry leader in many of our product lines our chemicals businesses consist primarily of large processing plants that convert large volumes of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon feedstocks into plastic resins and other chemicals our chemical products tend to be basic building blocks for other chemicals and plastics while our plastic products are typically used in large volume applications our customers use our plastics and chemicals to manufacture a wide range of products that people use in their everyday lives including food packaging home furnishings automotive components paints and coatings our refining business consists of our houston refinery which processes crude oil into refined products such as gasoline diesel and jet fuel 

our financial performance is influenced by the supply and demand for our products the cost and availability of feedstocks global and regional production capacity our operational efficiency and our ability to control costs we have a strong operational focus and as a producer of large volume commodities continuously strive to differentiate ourselves through safe reliable and lowcost operations in all our businesses we purchase large quantities of natural gas electricity and steam which we use as energy to fuel our facilities we also purchase large quantities of natural gas liquids and crude oil derivatives which we use as feedstocks during recent years the relatively low cost of natural gasderived raw materials in the us versus the global cost of crude oilderived raw materials has had a significant positive influence on the profitability of our north american operations while lower oil prices have reduced the north american feedstock advantage improved product supply and demand fundamentals in several businesses notably global polyolefins products have partially offset the decline 

segments 

we manage our operations through five operating segments our reportable segments are 

 

  

  

  

  

 financial information about our business segments and geographical areas can be found in note 21 segment and related information  to the consolidated financial statements information about the locations where we produce our primary products can be found under “description of properties” 

  

in 2017 2016 and 2015 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues 

olefins and polyolefins segments generally 

we are one of the leading worldwide producers of olefins and polyethylene “pe” and we are the world’s second largest producer of polypropylene “pp” we manage our olefin and polyolefin business in two reportable segments op—americas and op—eai 

olefins   coproducts —ethylene is the most significant petrochemical in terms of worldwide production volume and is the key building block for pe and many other chemicals and plastics ethylene is produced by steam cracking hydrocarbons such as ethane propane and naphtha this production results in coproducts such as aromatics and other olefins including propylene and butadiene ethylene and its coproducts are fundamental to many parts of the economy including the production of consumer products packaging housing and automotive components and other durable and nondurable goods 

polyolefins —polyolefins such as pe and pp are polymers derived from olefins including ethylene and propylene polyolefins are the most widely used thermoplastics in the world and are found in applications and products that enhance the everyday quality of life our products are used in consumer automotive and industrial applications ranging from food and beverage packaging to housewares and construction materials 

polyethylene —we produce high density polyethylene “hdpe” low density polyethylene “ldpe” and linear low density polyethylene “lldpe” pe sales accounted for approximately 21 24 and 21 of our total revenues in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

polypropylene —we produce pp homopolymers and copolymers pp compounds are produced from blends of polyolefins and additives and are sold mainly to the automotive and home appliances industries pp sales accounted for approximately 17 of our total revenues in 2017 2016 and 2015 

olefins and polyolefins—americas segment 

overview 

our op—americas segment produces and markets olefins and coproducts polyethylene and polypropylene 

sales  marketing  customers 

most of the ethylene we produce is consumed internally as a raw material in the production of pe and other derivatives with the balance sold to third party customers primarily under multiyear contracts in 2016 and 2017 we added a total of 880 million pounds of ethylene capacity at our facilities in north america 

we use all the propylene we produce in the production of pp propylene oxide and other derivatives of those products as a result we also purchase propylene from third parties in addition to purchases of propylene we purchase ethylene for resale when necessary to satisfy customer demand above our own production levels volumes of any of these products purchased for resale can vary significantly from period to period and are typically most significant during extended outages of our own production such as during planned maintenance however purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profits except to the extent that they replace lowercost production 

most of the ethylene and propylene production from our channelview corpus christi and la porte texas facilities is shipped via a pipeline system which has connections to numerous us gulf coast consumers this pipeline extends from corpus christi to mont belvieu texas in addition exchange agreements with other 

  

ethylene and coproducts producers allow access to customers who are not directly connected to this pipeline system some ethylene is shipped by railcar from our clinton iowa facility to our morris illinois facility and some is shipped directly to customers propylene is generally shipped by marine vessel barge railcar or truck 

our pp and pe production is typically sold through our sales organization to an extensive base of established customers and distributors servicing both the domestic and export markets either under annual contracts or on a spot basis we have sales offices in various locations in north america and our polyolefins primarily are transported in north america by railcar or truck export sales are primarily to customers in latin america with sales to asia expected to increase in the coming years as global supply and demand balances shift we also consume pp in our pp compounds business which is managed worldwide by our op—eai segment 

joint venture relationships 

we participate in a joint venture in mexico which provides us with capacity for approximately 640 million pounds of pp production the capacity is based on our percentage ownership of the joint venture’s total capacity we do not hold a majority interest in or have operational control of this joint venture 

raw materials 

raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost to produce ethylene and its coproducts the primary raw materials used in our americas olefin facilities are heavy liquids and natural gas liquids “ngls” heavy liquids include crude oilbased naphtha and other refined products as well as condensate a very light crude oil resulting from natural gas production ngls include ethane propane and butane the use of heavy liquid raw materials results in the production of significant volumes of coproducts such as propylene butadiene and benzene as well as gasoline blending components while the use of ngls results in the production of a smaller volume of coproducts 

our ability to pass on raw material price increases to our customers is dependent on marketdriven demand for olefins and polyolefins sales prices for products sold in the spot market are determined by market forces our contract prices are influenced by product supply and demand conditions spot prices indices published in industry publications and in some instances cost recovery formulas 

prior to 2010 olefins facilities using heavy liquids as feedstock generated higher margins than those using ngls however technological advances for extracting shalebased oil and gas have led to an increased supply of ngls providing a cost advantage over heavy liquids particularly in the us with reductions in oil prices since 2014 the cost advantage has declined but is still significant a plant’s flexibility to consume a wide range of raw materials generally will provide an advantage over plants that are restricted in their processing capabilities our americas’ facilities can process significant quantities of either heavy liquids or ngls we estimate that in the us we can produce up to approximately 90 of our total ethylene output using ngls changes in the raw material feedstock mix utilized in the production process will result in variances in production capacities among products we believe our raw material flexibility in the us is a key advantage in our production of ethylene and its coproducts 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to olefins and polyolefins competition is based on price and to a lesser extent on product quality product delivery reliability of supply product performance and customer service industry consolidation in north america has led to fewer although larger competitors profitability is affected not only by supply and demand for olefins and polyolefins but also by raw material costs and price competition among producers which may intensify due to among other things the addition of new capacity in general demand is a function of worldwide economic growth including the regional dynamics that underlie global growth trends 

  

we compete in north america with other large marketers and producers including global chemical companies chemical divisions of large oil companies and regional marketers and producers 

based on published capacity data we believe as of december 31 2017 we were 

 

  

  

 olefins and polyolefins—europe asia international segment 

overview 

our op—eai segment produces and markets olefins and coproducts polyethylene and polypropylene including pp compounds 

sales  marketing  customers 

our ethylene production is primarily consumed internally as a raw material in the production of polyolefins and we purchase additional ethylene as needed to meet our production needs our propylene production is used as a raw material in the production of pp and propylene oxide and derivatives of those products and we regularly purchase propylene from third parties because our internal needs exceed our internal production 

with respect to pp and pe our production is typically sold through our sales organization to an extensive base of established customers under annual contracts or on a spot basis and is also sold through distributors our polyolefins are primarily transported in europe by railcar or truck 

our regional sales offices are in various locations including the netherlands hong kong china india australia and the united arab emirates we also operate through a worldwide network of local sales and representative offices in europe asia and africa our joint ventures described below typically manage their domestic sales and marketing efforts independently and we typically operate as their agentdistributor for all or a portion of their exports 

joint venture relationships 

we participate in several manufacturing joint ventures in saudi arabia thailand poland australia and south korea we do not hold majority interests in any of these joint ventures nor do we have operational control these ventures provide us with additional production capacity of approximately 24 billion pounds of pp approximately 14 billion pounds of olefins approximately 09 billion pounds of pe and approximately 100 million pounds of pp compounds these capacities are based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint ventures’ total capacities we realize profits or losses from these ventures as income or loss on the equity basis of accounting 

we generally license our polyolefin process technologies and supply catalysts to our joint ventures through our technology segment some of our joint ventures are able to source cost advantaged raw materials from their local shareholders 

  

raw materials 

raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost for the production of olefins and coproducts the primary raw material used in our european olefin facilities is naphtha however in recent years we have sourced increased amounts of advantaged ngls when the opportunity arises for our saudi joint venture facilities locally sourced and cost advantaged ngls including ethane propane and butane are used the principal raw materials used in the production of polyolefins are propylene and ethylene in europe we have the capacity to produce approximately 50 of the propylene requirements for our european pp production and all of the ethylene requirements for our european pe production propylene and ethylene requirements that are not produced internally are generally acquired pursuant to longterm contracts with third party suppliers or via spot purchases 

our pp compounds facilities receive the majority of their pp raw materials from one of our wholly owned or joint venture facilities some of our joint ventures receive propylene and ethylene from their local shareholders under longterm contracts 

our ability to pass through the increased cost of raw materials to customers is dependent on global market demand for olefins and polyolefins in general the pricing for purchases and sales of most products is determined by global market forces including the impacts of foreign exchange relative to the pricing of the underlying naphtha raw materials most of which are priced in us dollars there can be a lag between naphtha raw material price changes and contract product price changes that will cause volatility in our product margins 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to olefins and polyolefins competition is based on price product quality product delivery reliability of supply product performance and customer service we compete with regional and multinational chemical companies and divisions of large oil companies the petrochemical market in the european union “eu” has been affected by the price volatility of naphtha the primary feedstock for olefins in the region as well as fluctuating demand as a result of changing european and global economic conditions 

based on published capacity data and including our proportionate share of our joint ventures we believe as of december 31 2017 we were 

 

  

  

 intermediates and derivatives segment 

overview 

our id segment produces and markets propylene oxide “po” and its derivatives oxyfuels and related products and intermediate chemicals such as styrene monomer “sm” acetyls and ethylene oxides and derivatives 

po and derivatives— we produce po through two distinct technologies one of which yields tertiary butyl alcohol “tba” as the coproduct and the other of which yields sm as the coproduct the two technologies are mutually exclusive with dedicated assets for manufacturing either potba or posm po is an intermediate commodity chemical and is a precursor of polyols propylene glycol propylene glycol ethers and butanediol po 

  

and derivatives are used in a variety of durable and consumable items with key applications such as urethane foams used for insulation automotivefurniture cushioning coatings surfactants synthetic resins and several other household usages 

oxyfuels and related products —we produce two distinct etherbased oxyfuels methyl tertiary butyl ether “mtbe” and ethyl tertiary butyl ether “etbe” these oxyfuels are produced by converting the tba coproduct of po into isobutylene and reacting with methanol or ethanol to produce either mtbe or etbe both are used as highoctane gasoline components that help gasoline burn cleaner and reduce automobile emissions other tba derivatives which we refer to as “c4 chemicals” are largely used to make synthetic rubber and other gasoline additives 

intermediate chemicals —we produce other commodity chemicals that utilize ethylene as a key component feedstock including sm acetyls and ethylene oxide derivatives sm is utilized in various applications such as plastics expandable polystyrene for packaging foam cups and containers insulation products and durables and engineering resins our acetyls products comprise methanol glacial acetic acid “gaa” and vinyl acetate monomer “vam” natural gas methane is the feedstock for methanol some of which is converted to gaa and a portion of the gaa is reacted with ethylene to create vam vam is an intermediate chemical used in fabric or wood treatments pigments coatings films and adhesives ethylene oxide is an intermediate chemical that is used to produce ethylene glycol glycol ethers and other derivatives ethylene oxide and its derivatives are used in the production of polyester antifreeze fluids solvents and other chemical products 

sales  marketing  customers 

we sell our po and derivatives through multiyear sales and processing agreements as well as spot sales some of our contract sales agreements have cost plus pricing terms po and derivatives are transported by barge marine vessel pipeline railcar and tank truck 

we sell our oxyfuels and related products under market and costbased sales agreements and in the spot market oxyfuels are transported by barge marine vessel and tank truck and are used as octane blending components worldwide outside of the united states due to their blending characteristics and emission benefits c4 chemicals such as highpurity isobutylene are sold to producers of synthetic rubber and other chemical products primarily in the united states and europe and are transported by railcar tank truck pipeline and marine shipments 

intermediate chemicals are shipped by barge marine vessel pipeline railcar and tank truck sm is sold globally into regions such as north america europe asia and south america export markets through spot sales and commercial contracts within acetyls methanol is consumed internally to make gaa used as a feedstock for oxyfuels and related products and also sold directly into the merchant commercial market gaa is converted with ethylene to produce vam which is sold worldwide under multiyear commercial contracts and on a spot basis 

sales of our po and derivatives oxyfuels and related products and intermediate chemicals are made by our marketing and sales personnel and also through distributors and independent agents in the americas europe the middle east africa and the asia pacific region 

joint venture relationships 

we have two po joint ventures with covestro ag one in the us and one in europe we operate four of the us po production facilities for the us po joint venture covestro’s interest represents ownership of an inkind portion of the po production of 15 billion pounds per year we take inkind the remaining po production and all coproduct production the parties’ rights in the joint venture are based on offtake volumes related to actual production of po as opposed to ownership percentages covestro also has the right to 50 of the 

  

po and sm production of our european po joint venture our proportional production capacity provided through this venture is approximately 340 million pounds of po and approximately 750 million pounds of sm we do not share marketing or product sales with covestro under either of these po joint ventures 

we also have joint venture manufacturing relationships in china these ventures provide us with additional production capacity of approximately 115 million pounds of po this capacity is based on our operational share of the joint ventures’ total capacities 

raw materials 

the cost of raw materials is the largest component of total production cost for po its coproducts and its derivatives propylene isobutane or mixed butane ethylene and benzene are the primary raw materials used in the production of po and its coproducts the market prices of these raw materials historically have been related to the price of crude oil ngls and natural gas as well as supply and demand for the raw materials 

in the us we obtain a large portion of our propylene benzene and ethylene raw materials needed for the production of po and its coproducts from our op—americas segment and to a lesser extent from third parties raw materials for the nonus production of po and its coproducts are obtained from our op—eai segment and from third parties we consume a significant portion of our internallyproduced po in the production of po derivatives 

the raw material requirements not sourced internally are purchased at marketbased prices from numerous suppliers in the us and europe with which we have established contractual relationships as well as in the spot market 

for the production of oxyfuels we purchase our ethanol feedstock requirements from third parties and obtain our methanol from both internal production and external sources carbon monoxide and methanol are the primary raw materials required for the production of gaa we purchase carbon monoxide pursuant to a longterm contract with pricing primarily based on the cost of production the methanol required for our downstream production of acetyls is internally sourced from a partnership and from our methanol plant at channelview texas natural gas is the primary raw material required for the production of methanol 

in addition to ethylene acetic acid is a primary raw material for the production of vam we obtain all our requirements for acetic acid and ethylene from our internal production historically we have used a large percentage of our acetic acid production to produce vam 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to product competition the market is influenced and based on a variety of factors including product quality price reliability of supply technical support customer service and potential substitute materials profitability is affected by the worldwide level of demand along with price competition which may intensify due to among other things new industry capacity and industry outages demand growth could be impacted by further development of alternative biobased methodologies our major worldwide competitors include other multinational chemical and refining companies as well as some regional marketers and producers 

based on published capacity data excluding our partners’ shares of joint venture capacity we believe as of december 31 2017 we were 

 

  

   

refining segment 

overview 

the primary products of our refining segment are refined products made from heavy highsulfur crude oil and other crude oils of varied types and sources available on the us gulf coast these refined products include gasoline and other distillates 

sales  marketing  customers 

the houston refinery’s products are primarily sold in bulk to other refiners marketers distributors and wholesalers at marketrelated prices most of the houston refinery’s products are sold under contracts with a term of one year or less or are sold in the spot market the houston refinery’s products generally are transported to customers via pipelines and terminals owned and operated by other parties the sales of refined products accounted for approximately 18 16 and 19 of our total revenues in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

raw materials 

our houston refinery which is located on the houston ship channel in houston texas has a heavy highsulfur crude oil processing capacity of approximately 268000 barrels per day on a calendar day basis normal operating basis or approximately 292000 barrels per day on a stream day basis maximum achievable over a 24hour period the houston refinery is a full conversion refinery designed to refine heavy highsulfur crude oil this crude oil is more viscous and dense than traditional crude oil and contains higher concentrations of sulfur and heavy metals making it more difficult to refine into gasoline and other highvalue fuel products however this crude oil has historically been less costly to purchase than light lowsulfur crude oil such as brent 

we purchase the crude oil used as a raw material for the houston refinery on the open market on a spot basis and under a number of supply agreements with regional producers generally with terms varying from one to two years 

industry dynamics  competition 

our refining competitors are major integrated oil companies refineries owned or controlled by foreign governments and independent domestic refiners based on published data as of january 2017 there were 141 operable crude oil refineries in the us and total us refinery capacity was approximately 183 million barrels per day during 2017 the houston refinery processed an average of approximately 236000 barrels per day of heavy crude oil 

our refining operations compete for the purchases of crude oil based on price and quality supply disruptions could impact the availability and pricing we compete in gasoline and distillate markets as a bulk supplier of fungible products satisfying industry and government specifications competition is based on price and location 

the markets for fuel products tend to be volatile as well as cyclical as a result of the changing global economy and changing crude oil and refined product prices crude oil prices are impacted by worldwide political events the economics of exploration and production and refined products demand prices and demand for fuel products are influenced by seasonal and shortterm factors such as weather and driving patterns as well as by longer term issues such as the economy energy conservation and alternative fuels industry fuel products supply is dependent on shortterm industry operating capabilities and on longterm refining capacity 

a crack spread is a benchmark indication of refining margins based on the processing of a specific type of crude oil into an assumed selection of major refined products the houston refinery generally tracks the maya 211 crack spread which represents the difference between the current month gulf coast price of two barrels of 

  

maya crude oil as set by petróleos mexicanos “pemex” and one barrel each of us gulf coast reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending “rbob” gasoline and of us gulf coast ultra low sulfur diesel “ulsd” while these benchmark refining spreads are generally indicative of the level of profitability at the houston refinery and similarly configured refineries there are many other factors specific to each refinery and the industry in general such as the value of refinery byproducts which influence operating results refinery byproducts are products other than gasoline and distillates that represent about onethird of the total product volume and include coke sulfur and lighter materials such as ngls and crude olefins streams the cost of renewable identification numbers “rins” which are renewable fuel credits mandated by the us environmental protection agency the “epa” can also affect profitability 

technology segment 

overview 

our technology segment develops and licenses chemical and polyolefin process technologies and manufactures and sells polyolefin catalysts we market our process technologies and our polyolefin catalysts to external customers and also use them in our own manufacturing operations approximately 25 of our catalyst sales are intercompany 

our polyolefin process licenses are structured to provide a standard core technology with individual customer needs met by adding customized modules that provide the required capabilities to produce the defined production grade slate and plant capacity in addition to the basic license agreement a range of services can also be provided including project assistance training assistance in starting up the plant and ongoing technical support after startup we may also offer marketing and sales services in addition licensees may continue to purchase polyolefin catalysts that are consumed in the production process generally under longterm catalyst supply agreements with us 

research and development 

our research and development “rd” activities are designed to improve our existing products and processes and discover and commercialize new materials catalysts and processes these activities focus on product and application development process development catalyst development and fundamental polyolefinfocused research 

in 2017 2016 and 2015 our rd expenditures were 106 million 99 million and 102 million respectively a portion of these expenses are related to technical support and customer service and are allocated to the other business segments in 2017 2016 and 2015 approximately 45 of all rd costs were allocated to business segments other than technology 

general 




 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 

our business including our results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected by safety or product liability issues 

failure to appropriately manage safety human health product liability and environmental risks associated with our products product life cycles and production processes could adversely impact employees communities stakeholders our reputation and our results of operations public perception of the risks associated with our products and production processes could impact product acceptance and influence the regulatory environment in which we operate while we have procedures and controls to manage safety risks issues could be created by events outside of our control including natural disasters severe weather events and acts of sabotage 

  

our operations are subject to risks inherent in chemical and refining businesses and we could be subject to liabilities for which we are not fully insured or that are not otherwise mitigated 

we maintain property business interruption product general liability casualty and other types of insurance that we believe are appropriate for our business and operations as well as in line with industry practices however we are not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to our business including losses resulting from natural disasters wars or terrorist acts changes in insurance market conditions have caused and may in the future cause premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies to increase substantially and in some instances for certain insurance to become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured we might not be able to finance the amount of the uninsured liability on terms acceptable to us or at all and might be obligated to divert a significant portion of our cash flow from normal business operations 

further because a part of our business involves licensing polyolefin process technology our licensees are exposed to similar risks involved in the manufacture and marketing of polyolefins hazardous incidents involving our licensees if they do result or are perceived to result from use of our technologies may harm our reputation threaten our relationships with other licensees andor lead to customer attrition and financial losses our policy of covering these risks through contractual limitations of liability and indemnities and through insurance may not always be effective as a result our financial condition and results of operation would be adversely affected and other companies with competing technologies may have the opportunity to secure a competitive advantage 

a sustained decrease in the price of crude oil may adversely impact the results of our operations primarily in north america 

energy costs generally follow price trends of crude oil and natural gas these price trends may be highly volatile and cyclical in the past raw material and energy costs have experienced significant fluctuations that adversely affected our business segments’ results of operations for example we have benefitted from the favorable ratio of us crude oil prices to natural gas prices in recent years this advantage was reduced as oil prices declined beginning in 2014 if the price of crude oil remains lower relative to us natural gas prices or if the demand for natural gas and ngls increases this may have a negative impact on our results of operations 

costs and limitations on supply of raw materials and energy may result in increased operating expenses 

the costs of raw materials and energy represent a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to the significant competition we face and the commodity nature of many of our products we are not always able to pass on raw material and energy cost increases to our customers when we do have the ability to pass on the cost increases we are not always able to do so quickly enough to avoid adverse impacts on our results of operations 

cost increases for raw materials also may increase working capital needs which could reduce our liquidity and cash flow even if we increase our sales prices to reflect rising raw material and energy costs demand for products may decrease as customers reduce their consumption or use substitute products which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition producers in natural gas costadvantaged regions such as the middle east and north america benefit from the lower prices of natural gas and ngls competition from producers in these regions may cause us to reduce exports from europe and elsewhere any such reductions may increase competition for product sales within europe and other markets which can result in lower margins in those regions 

for some of our raw materials and utilities there are a limited number of suppliers and in some cases the supplies are specific to the particular geographic region in which a facility is located it is also common in the chemical and refining industries for a facility to have a sole dedicated source for its utilities such as steam electricity and gas having a sole or limited number of suppliers may limit our negotiating power particularly in 

  

the case of rising raw material costs any new supply agreements we enter into may not have terms as favorable as those contained in our current supply agreements 

additionally there is growing concern over the reliability of water sources including around the texas gulf coast where several of our facilities are located the decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of population growth drought or regulation could negatively impact our operations 

if our raw material or utility supplies were disrupted our businesses may incur increased costs to procure alternative supplies or incur excessive downtime which would have a direct negative impact on plant operations disruptions of supplies may occur as a result of transportation issues resulting from natural disasters water levels and interruptions in marine water routes among other causes that can affect the operations of vessels barges rails trucks and pipeline traffic these risks are particularly prevalent in the us gulf coast area additionally increasing exports of ngls and crude oil from the us or greater restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could restrict the availability of our raw materials thereby increasing our costs 

with increased volatility in raw material costs our suppliers could impose more onerous terms on us resulting in shorter payment cycles and increasing our working capital requirements 

our ability to source raw materials may be adversely affected by political instability civil disturbances or other governmental actions 

we obtain a portion of our principal raw materials from sources in north africa the middle east and central and south america that may be less politically stable than other areas in which we conduct business such as europe or the us political instability civil disturbances and actions by governments in these areas are more likely to substantially increase the price and decrease the supply of raw materials necessary for our operations which will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

increased incidents of civil unrest including terrorist attacks and demonstrations that have been marked by violence have occurred in a number of countries in north africa and the middle east some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest political instability and civil unrest could continue to spread in the region and involve other areas such unrest if it continues to spread or grow in intensity could lead to civil wars regional conflicts or regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to countries in which we conduct substantial business such as in europe the us or their respective trading partners 

economic disruptions and downturns in general and particularly continued global economic uncertainty or economic turmoil in emerging markets could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

our results of operations can be materially affected by adverse conditions in the financial markets and depressed economic conditions generally economic downturns in the businesses and geographic areas in which we sell our products substantially reduce demand for our products and result in decreased sales volumes and increased credit risk recessionary environments adversely affect our business because demand for our products is reduced particularly from our customers in industrial markets generally and the automotive and housing industries specifically and may result in higher costs of capital a significant portion of our revenues and earnings are derived from our business in europe including southern europe in addition most of our european transactions and assets including cash reserves and receivables are denominated in euros 

if a sustained financial crisis in europe leads to a significant devaluation of the euro the value of our financial assets that are denominated in euros would be significantly reduced when translated to us dollars for financial reporting purposes we also derive significant revenues from our business in emerging markets particularly the emerging markets in asia and south america any broadbased downturn in these emerging 

  

markets or in a key market such as china could require us to reduce export volumes into these markets and could also require us to divert product sales to less profitable markets any of these conditions could ultimately harm our overall business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

the cyclicality and volatility of the industries in which we participate may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 

our business operations are subject to the cyclical and volatile nature of the supplydemand balance in the chemical and refining industries our future operating results are expected to continue to be affected by this cyclicality and volatility the chemical and refining industries historically have experienced alternating periods of capacity shortages causing prices and profit margins to increase followed by periods of excess capacity resulting in oversupply declining capacity utilization rates and declining prices and profit margins 

in addition to changes in the supply and demand for products changes in energy prices and other worldwide economic conditions can cause volatility these factors result in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over business cycles 

new capacity additions in asia the middle east and north america may lead to periods of oversupply and lower profitability a sizable number of expansions have been announced in north america the timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions are uncertain and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time as a consequence we are unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of future industry cycles or their effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we sell products in highly competitive global markets and face significant price pressures 

we sell our products in highly competitive global markets due to the commodity nature of many of our products competition in these markets is based primarily on price and to a lesser extent on product performance product quality product deliverability reliability of supply and customer service often we are not able to protect our market position for these products by product differentiation and may not be able to pass on cost increases to our customers due to the significant competition in our business 

in addition we face increased competition from companies that may have greater financial resources and different cost structures or strategic goals than us these include large integrated oil companies some of which also have chemical businesses governmentowned businesses and companies that receive subsidies or other government incentives to produce certain products in a specified geographic region continuing competition from these companies especially in our olefin and refining businesses could limit our ability to increase product sales prices in response to raw material and other cost increases or could cause us to reduce product sales prices to compete effectively which would reduce our profitability competitors with different cost structures or strategic goals than we have may be able to invest significant capital into their businesses including expenditures for research and development in addition specialty products we produce may become commoditized over time increased competition could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 

interruptions of operations at our facilities may result in liabilities or lower operating results 

we own and operate largescale facilities our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our various production facilities and the ability to complete construction and maintenance projects on schedule interruptions at our facilities may materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or our business as a whole during and after the period of such operational difficulties in the past we had to shut down plants on the us gulf coast including the temporary shutdown of our houston refinery as a result of hurricanes striking the texas coast 

  

in addition because the houston refinery is our only refining operation an outage at the refinery could have a particularly negative impact on our operating results unlike our chemical and polymer production facilities which may have sufficient excess capacity to mitigate the negative impact of lost production at other facilities we do not have the ability to increase refining production elsewhere in the us 

although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions our operations are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and refining and the related storage and transportation of raw materials products and wastes these potential hazards include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or personal injury and loss of life and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date negatively impacting project returns if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering procurement and construction of facilities could materially adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors many of which are beyond our control including 

 

   

  

  

  

  

 any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects if we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs or if market conditions change it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increased it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products facilities and services 

increased global information security threats and more sophisticated targeted computer crime pose a risk to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data operations and infrastructure while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including security measures employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our employees systems networks products facilities and services remain potentially vulnerable to sophisticated espionage or cyberassault depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations 

we operate internationally and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations exchange controls political risks and other risks relating to international operations 

we operate internationally and are subject to the risks of doing business on a global level these risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates economic instability and disruptions restrictions on the transfer of funds and the imposition of trade restrictions or duties and tariffs additional risks from our multinational business include transportation delays and interruptions war terrorist activities epidemics pandemics political instability import and export controls changes in governmental policies labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments 

we generate revenues from export sales and operations that may be denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency exchange rates between these currencies and functional currencies in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future it is possible that fluctuations in exchange rates will result in reduced operating results additionally we operate with the objective of having our worldwide cash available in the locations where it is needed including the united kingdom for our parent company’s significant cash obligations as a result of dividend and interest payments it is possible that we may not always be able to provide cash to other jurisdictions when needed or that such transfers of cash could be subject to additional taxes including withholding taxes 

our operating results could be negatively affected by the global laws rules and regulations as well as political environments in the jurisdictions in which we operate there could be reduced demand for our products decreases in the prices at which we can sell our products and disruptions of production or other operations trade protection measures such as quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures or antidumping duties imposed in the countries in which we operate could negatively impact our business additionally there may be substantial 

  

capital and other costs to comply with regulations andor increased security costs or insurance premiums any of which could reduce our operating results 

we obtain a portion of our principal raw materials from international sources that are subject to these same risks our compliance with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject could be challenged furthermore these laws may be modified the result of which may be to prevent or limit subsidiaries from transferring cash to us 

furthermore we are subject to certain existing and may be subject to possible future laws that limit or may limit our activities while some of our competitors may not be subject to such laws which may adversely affect our competitiveness 

changes in tax laws and regulations could affect our tax rate and our results of operations 

we are a tax resident in the united kingdom and are subject to the united kingdom corporate income tax system lyondellbasell industries nv has little or no taxable income of its own because as a holding company it does not conduct any operations through our subsidiaries we have substantial operations worldwide taxes are primarily paid on the earnings generated in various jurisdictions including the us the netherlands germany france and italy 

a portion of our interest income from internal financing is either untaxed or taxed at rates substantially lower than the us statutory rate in september 2016 the united kingdom enacted provisions the so called “antihybrid provisions” effective for years beginning january 1 2017 that resulted in changes to our internal financing structure which did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements in addition in october 2016 the us treasury issued final section 385 debtequity regulations that could impact our internal financings in future years pursuant to a recent executive order the treasury department reviewed these regulations and determined to delay but retain these regulations subject to further review after the enactment of us tax reform in december 2017 the us enacted “hr1” also known as the “tax cuts and jobs act” the “tax act” materially impacting our 2017 consolidated financial statements and significantly affecting future periods we are awaiting treasury’s review of the existing section 385 debtequity regulations which could impact our internal financings in future years as well as any new regulations pursuant to treasury’s expanded regulatory authority under the tax act 

we monitor income tax developments in countries where we conduct business recently there has been an increase in attention both in the us and globally to the tax practices of multinational companies including the european union’s state aid investigations and proposals by the organization for economic cooperation and development with respect to base erosion and profit shifting such attention may result in additional legislative changes that could adversely affect our tax rate other than the recently enacted tax act management does not believe that recent changes in income tax laws will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements although new or proposed changes to tax laws could affect our tax liabilities in the future 

many of our businesses depend on our intellectual property our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and our inability to do so could reduce our ability to maintain our competitiveness and margins 

we have a significant worldwide patent portfolio of issued and pending patents these patents and patent applications together with proprietary technical knowhow are significant to our competitive position particularly with regard to po performance chemicals petrochemicals and polymers we rely on the patent copyright and trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing however we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without authorization proceedings to protect these rights could be costly and we may not prevail 

  

the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes apparatuses technology trade secrets or proprietary knowhow could result in significantly lower revenues reduced profit margins and cash flows andor loss of market share we also may be subject to claims that our technology patents or other intellectual property infringes on a third party’s intellectual property rights unfavorable resolution of these claims could result in restrictions on our ability to deliver the related service or in a settlement that could be material to us 

shared control or lack of control of joint ventures may delay decisions or actions regarding the joint ventures 

a portion of our operations are conducted through joint ventures where control may be exercised by or shared with unaffiliated third parties we cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners including any nonperformance default or bankruptcy of joint venture partners the joint ventures that we do not control may also lack financial reporting systems to provide adequate and timely information for our reporting purposes 

our joint venture partners may have different interests or goals than we do and may take actions contrary to our requests policies or objectives differences in views among the joint venture participants also may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major matters potentially adversely affecting the business and operations of the joint ventures and in turn our business and operations we may develop a dispute with any of our partners over decisions affecting the venture that may result in litigation arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution if a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interest it could harm our brand business results of operations and financial condition 

we cannot predict with certainty the extent of future costs under environmental health and safety and other laws and regulations and cannot guarantee they will not be material 

we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture handle or own in addition because our products are components of a variety of other enduse products we along with other members of the chemical industry are subject to potential claims related to those enduse products any substantial increase in the success of these types of claims could negatively affect our operating results 

we together with the industries in which we operate are subject to extensive national regional state and local environmental laws regulations directives rules and ordinances concerning 

 

  

  

 many of these laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations in addition some of these laws and regulations require us to meet specific financial responsibility requirements any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

although we have compliance programs and other processes intended to ensure compliance with all such regulations we are subject to the risk that our compliance with such regulations could be challenged noncompliance with certain of these regulations could result in the incurrence of additional costs penalties or assessments that could be material 

  

our industry is subject to extensive government regulation and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures 

compliance with regulatory requirements could result in higher operating costs such as regulatory requirements relating to emissions the security of our facilities and the transportation export or registration of our products we generally expect that regulatory controls worldwide will become increasingly more demanding but cannot accurately predict future developments 

increasingly strict environmental laws and inspection and enforcement policies could affect the handling manufacture use emission or disposal of products other materials or hazardous and nonhazardous waste stricter environmental safety and health laws regulations and enforcement policies could result in increased operating costs or capital expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations additionally we are required to have permits for our businesses and are subject to licensing regulations these permits and licenses are subject to renewal modification and in some circumstances revocation further the permits and licenses are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

we may incur substantial costs to comply with climate change legislation and related regulatory initiatives 

there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas “ghg” reduction these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future laws and regulations in this field continue to evolve and while they are likely to be increasingly widespread and stringent at this stage it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation within the framework of the eu emissions trading scheme “ets” we were allocated certain allowances of carbon dioxide for the affected plants of our european sites for the period from 2008 to 2012 “ets ii period” the ets ii period did not bring additional cost to us as the allowance allocation was sufficient to cover the actual emissions of the affected plants we were able to build an allowance surplus during the ets ii period which has been banked to the scheme for the period from 2013 to 2020 “ets iii period” we expect to incur additional costs for the ets iii period despite the allowance surplus accrued over the ets ii period as allowance allocations have been reduced for the ets iii period and more of our plants are affected by the scheme we maintain an active hedging strategy to cover these additional costs we expect to incur additional costs in relation to future carbon or ghg emission trading schemes 

in the us the environmental protection agency the “epa” has promulgated federal ghg regulations under the clean air act affecting certain sources the epa has issued mandatory ghg reporting requirements requirements to obtain ghg permits for certain industrial plants and proposals for ghg performance standards for some facilities the recent epa action could be a precursor to further federal regulation of carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases and may affect the outcome of other climate change lawsuits pending in us courts in a manner unfavorable to our industry in any event additional regulation may be forthcoming at the us federal or state level with respect to ghg emissions and such regulation could result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances 

compliance with these or other changes in laws regulations and obligations that create a ghg emissions trading scheme or ghg reduction policies generally could significantly increase our costs or reduce demand for products we produce additionally compliance with these regulations may result in increased permitting necessary for the operation of our business or for any of our growth plans difficulties in obtaining such permits could have an adverse effect on our future growth therefore any future potential regulations and legislation could result in increased compliance costs additional operating restrictions or delays in implementing growth projects or other capital investments and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

  

we may be required to record material charges against our earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets 

we may be required to reduce production or idle facilities for extended periods of time or exit certain businesses as a result of the cyclical nature of our industry specifically oversupplies of or lack of demand for particular products or high raw material prices may cause us to reduce production we may choose to reduce production at certain facilities because we have offtake arrangements at other facilities which make any reductions or idling unavailable at those facilities any decision to permanently close facilities or exit a business likely would result in impairment and other charges to earnings 

temporary outages at our facilities can last for several quarters and sometimes longer these outages could cause us to incur significant costs including the expenses of maintaining and restarting these facilities in addition even though we may reduce production at facilities we may be required to continue to purchase or pay for utilities or raw materials under takeorpay supply agreements 

our business is capital intensive and we rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and ongoing capital needs limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results 

we require significant capital to operate our current business and fund our growth strategy moreover interest payments dividends and the expansion of our business or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital we believe that our cash from operations currently will be sufficient to meet these needs however if we need external financing our access to credit markets and pricing of our capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies and the state of the capital markets generally there can be no assurances that we would be able to incur indebtedness on terms we deem acceptable and it is possible that the cost of any financings could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities which could adversely affect our operating results 

we may use our fiveyear 25 billion revolving credit facility which backs our commercial paper program to meet our cash needs to the extent available as of december 31 2017 we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the facility and no borrowings under our commercial paper program leaving an unused and available credit capacity of 2500 million we may also meet our cash needs by selling receivables under our 900 million us accounts receivable securitization facility in the event of a default under our credit facility or any of our senior notes we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do any default under any of our credit arrangements could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate 

legislation and regulatory initiatives could lead to a decrease in demand for our products 

new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health safety and the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products initiatives by governments and private interest groups will potentially require increased toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us for example in the united states the national toxicology program “ntp” is a federal interagency program that seeks to identify and select for study chemicals and other substances to evaluate potential human health hazards in the european union the regulation on registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals “reach” is regulation designed to identify the intrinsic properties of chemical substances assess hazards and risks of the substances and identify and implement the risk management measures to protect humans and the environment 

  

assessments under ntp reach or similar programs or regulations in other jurisdictions may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals we use or produce and may result in additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of those chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

adverse results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us 

we are subject to and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty irrespective of its merits litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expenditure and diversion of management attention we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations should we fail to prevail in certain matters 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may adversely affect the valuation of pension obligations the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rates used to measure pension obligations the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets may result in corresponding increases and decreases in the value of plan assets particularly equity securities or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets any changes in key actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate or mortality rate would impact the valuation of pension obligations affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years 

nearly all of our current pension plans have projected benefit obligations that exceed the fair value of the plan assets as of december 31 2017 the aggregate deficit was 903 million any declines in the fair values of the pension plans’ assets could require additional payments by us in order to maintain specified funding levels 

our pension plans are subject to legislative and regulatory requirements of applicable jurisdictions which could include under certain circumstances local governmental authority to terminate the plan 

integration of acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price 

we may make acquisitions in order to enhance our business on february 15 2018 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a schulman acquisitions involve numerous risks including problems combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs and liabilities diversion of management’s attention from our core businesses and potential loss of key employees 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to integrate successfully any businesses products technologies or personnel that we might acquire the integration of businesses that we may acquire is likely to be a complex timeconsuming and expensive process and we may not realize the anticipated revenues or other benefits associated with our acquisitions if we do not manage and operate the acquired business up to our expectations if we are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems operating procedures financial controls and human resources practices our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected

 intellectual property 

we maintain an extensive patent portfolio and continue to file new patent applications in the us and other countries as of december 31 2017 we owned approximately 5580 patents and patent applications worldwide our patents and trade secrets cover our processes products and catalysts and are significant to our competitive position particularly with regard to po intermediate chemicals petrochemicals polymers and our process technologies we own globally registered and unregistered trademarks including marks for “lyondellbasell” “lyondell” “basell” and “equistar” while we believe that our intellectual property provides competitive advantages we do not regard our businesses as being materially dependent upon any single patent trade secret or trademark some of our heritage production capacity operates under licenses from third parties 

  

environmental 

most of our operations are affected by national state regional and local environmental laws matters pertaining to the environment are discussed in part i item 1a risk factors  part i item 3 legal proceedings  part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation s and notes 2 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

we have made and intend to continue to make the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to environmental health and safety matters we incurred capital expenditures of 279 million in 2017 for health safety and environmental compliance purposes and improvement programs and estimate such expenditures to be approximately 210 million in 2018 and 230 million in 2019 

while capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance including compliance with potential legislation and potential regulation related to climate change cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe they will have a material effect on our competitive position 

while there can be no assurance that physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future we do not believe these risks are material in the near term

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend environmental matters 

from time to time we and our joint ventures receive notices or inquiries from government entities regarding alleged violations of environmental laws and regulations pertaining to among other things the disposal emission and storage of chemical and petroleum substances including hazardous wastes item 103 of the sec’s regulation sk requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and the proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that we reasonably believe could exceed 100000 the matters below are disclosed solely pursuant to that requirement 

in september 2013 the louisiana department of environmental quality the “ldeq” issued a compliance order and notice of potential penalty to equistar chemicals lp pertaining to selfreported deviations arising from our lake charles louisiana polyolefins plant and relating to certain clean air act title v permit conditions limits and other requirements the matter involves deviations reported by us to the ldeq in semiannual reports covering 2007 through june 2011 we reasonably believe that ldeq may assert an administrative penalty demand in this matter in excess of 100000 

in september 2013 the epa region v issued a notice and finding of violation alleging violations at our morris illinois facility related to flaring activity the notice generally alleges failures to monitor steam usage and improper flare operations region v indicated at a december 2017 meeting that it intends to issue an administrative enforcement order in 2018 we reasonably believe that epa region v may assert a penalty demand in excess of 100000 

in june 2014 epa region v issued a notice and finding of violation alleging violations at our tuscola illinois facility related to flaring activity the notice generally alleges failure to conduct a valid performance test and improper flare operations region v indicated at a december 2017 meeting that it intends to issue an administrative enforcement order in 2018 we reasonably believe that epa region v may assert a penalty demand in excess of 100000 

in august 2015 the victoria plant experienced a hexane leak into the cooling water system which resulted in estimated emissions of 154000 pounds of hexane over a 12day period from the cooling water pond operated by the site host invista in november 2017 the texas commission on environmental quality the “tceq” issued a proposed agreed order to both invista and equistar assessing a proposed penalty of 300000 we are currently in discussions with tceq 

in march 2017 the tceq issued a proposed agreed order to houston refining lp the proposed agreed order stems from agency record reviews conducted from may to july 2016 and september to october 2016 and an agency investigation conducted in april 2016 in june 2017 tceq issued a revised agreed order that carries a total administrative penalty of 77626 the agreed order is currently awaiting final tceq approval

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend general 

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes elsewhere in this report when we use the terms “we” “us” “our” or similar words in this discussion unless the context otherwise requires we are referring to lyondellbasell industries nv and its consolidated subsidiaries 

overview 

we demonstrated the strength of our earnings performance under dynamic market conditions in 2017 with increased volumes improved ebitda and higher earnings relative to 2016 the complementary performance of our op—americas and op—eai segments combined with the relative stability of our id segment’s portfolio provided a resilient platform for profitability in 2017 global operating rates remained strong in 2017 due to delays in new capacity a volume shortfall from hurricane harvey and an improving market in china our reliable performance during the year positioned us to capture market opportunities as they arose we also advanced our growth program by commencing construction on our new hyperzone highdensity polyethylene plant in la porte texas and reaching a final investment decision for a worldscale potba plant

results of operations for the periods discussed are presented in the table below 

 

 results of operations 

revenues —we had revenues of 34484 million in 2017 29183 million in 2016 and 32735 million in 2015 

2017 versus 2016— revenues increased by 5301 million or 18 in 2017 compared to 2016 

average sales prices in 2017 were higher across most products as sales prices generally correlate with crude oil and natural gas prices which on average increased compared to the corresponding period in 2016 these higher prices led to increases in revenues of 15 higher sales volumes in our op—americas opeai and refining segments which were partly offset by lower id segment volumes led to a revenue increase in 2017 of 2 favorable foreign exchange impacts were responsible for a 1 revenue increase in 2017 

2016 versus 2015— revenues decreased 3552 million or 11 in 2016 compared to 2015 

lower average sales prices driven by decreases in the prices of crude oil and other feedstocks led to revenue declines of 10 in 2016 lower sales volumes in our refining segment due to turnaround activities and unplanned outages which were substantially offset by higher id segment sales volumes led to a 1 volumedriven decline in revenues the decline in revenues includes a 290 million impact from the sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary revenues for each of our business segments are reviewed further in the “segment analysis” section below 

cost of sales —cost of sales were 28059 million in 2017 23191 million in 2016 and 25683 million in 2015 

fluctuations in our cost of sales are generally driven by changes in feedstock and energy costs as all other material components remain relatively flat from year to year feedstock and energy related costs generally represent approximately 75 to 80 of cost of sales other variable costs account for approximately 10 of cost of sales on an annual basis and fixed operating costs consisting primarily of expenses associated with employee compensation depreciation and amortization and maintenance range from approximately 10 to 15 in each annual period 

  

2017 versus 2016— cost of sales increased by 4868 million or 21 in 2017 compared to 2016 this increase was primarily due to higher feedstock and energy costs costs for crude oil heavy liquids and natural gas liquids “ngls” and other feedstocks were higher in 2017 relative to 2016 

2016 versus 2015— cost of sales decreased by 2492 million or 10 in 2016 compared to 2015 

the decrease in cost of sales in 2016 was primarily due to lower feedstock and energy costs raw material costs for crude oil heavy liquids and ngls and other feedstocks were lower in 2016 compared to 2015 the sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary in 2016 also contributed approximately 230 million to the decline in 2016 cost of sales 

cost of sales in 2016 and 2015 also included noncash pretax lcm inventory valuation charges totaling 29 million and 548 million respectively the 2016 adjustment is related to a drop in polypropylene prices in our op—americas segment and the adjustments in 2015 affected all of our segments except technology the 2015 adjustments were driven mainly by declines in the prices for crude oil ethylene propylene benzene and etbe during 2015 cost of sales also included 35 million of amortization expense associated with the expiration of emission allowance credits in our refining and id segments 

operating income —our operating income was 5460 million 5060 million and 6122 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

2017 versus 2016— operating income increased by 400 million in 2017 

this improvement over 2016 was primarily due to increases of 144 million 140 million 77 million and 68 million in operating income for our id op—eai refining and op—americas segments respectively 

2016 versus 2015— operating income decreased by 1062 million in 2016 

operating income for 2016 reflects the impacts of the lcm inventory valuation adjustment discussed above and a 58 million pension settlement charge operating income for 2015 reflects the lcm inventory valuation adjustment and the emission credit allowance amortization discussed above including these impacts 2016 operating income declined relative to 2015 by 863 million 243 million and 166 million in our op—americas refining and id segments respectively these lower results were partially offset by a 185 million improvement in operating income for our op—eai segment 

operating results for each of our business segments are reviewed further in the “segment analysis” section below 

interest expense —interest expense was 491 million in 2017 322 million in 2016 and 310 million in 2015 

2017 versus 2016— we recognized charges totaling 113 million related to the march 2017 redemption of 1000 million of our outstanding 5 senior notes due 2019 these charges include 65 million of prepayment premiums 44 million for adjustments associated with fair value hedges and 4 million for the writeoff of associated unamortized debt issuance costs 

compared to 2016 and excluding the effects of fair value hedges and the charges described above interest expense decreased 39 million in 2017 due to the redemption of our 5 senior notes due 2019 in the first quarter of 2017 and increased 35 million as a result of the related to debt issuances in march 2017 of our 35 guaranteed notes due 2027 and in march 2016 of our 1875 guaranteed notes due 2022 a reduction in the 

  

amount of interest capitalized during 2017 and increased charges from our fair value hedges resulted in incremental increases in interest expense of 13 million and 45 million respectively relative to 2016 

2016 versus 2015— debt issuances of our 1875 guaranteed notes due 2022 in march 2016 and our 4625 senior notes due 2055 in march 2015 and reduced benefits from our fixedforfloating interest rate swaps resulted in 42 million of higher interest expense in 2016 this increase was partially offset by a 22 million increase in capitalized interest and 7 million of lower bank and other fees 

for additional information related to our fair value hedges and fixedforfloating interest rate swaps see notes 12 and 14 

other income net —other income net was 179 million in 2017 111 million in 2016 and 25 million in 2015 

2017 versus 2016— the 68 million increase in other income net is primarily due to gains recognized on the 2017 sales of a joint venture interest and other assets and the elimination of a noncash obligation in 2017 as compared to the gain on the 2016 sale of our wholly owned subsidiary in argentina 

in 2017 we recognized gains of 108 million on the sale of our op—eai segment’s 27 interest in its geosel joint venture and 31 million on the sale of our op—americas segment’s lake charles louisiana site we also recognized a 21 million noncash gain in our op—eai segment related to the elimination of an obligation associated with a lease 

in 2016 we recognized a 78 million gain related to the sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary we allocated 57 million and 21 million of this gain to our op—americas and op—eai segments respectively 

2016 versus 2015— the 86 million increase in other income net is largely due to the 78 million gain on the sale of our wholly owned subsidiary mentioned above 

income from equity investments —our income from equity investments was 321 million in 2017 367 million in 2016 and 339 million in 2015 

2017 versus 2016— income from our equity investments decreased in 2017 mainly due to lower results for our joint ventures in poland asia and mexico  

2016 versus 2015— the 28 million increase in income from equity investments in 2016 is largely due to improved results for our joint ventures in mexico saudi arabia poland and thailand 

income taxes— our effective income tax rates of 109 in 2017 265 in 2016 and 279 in 2015 resulted in tax provisions of 598 million 1386 million and 1730 million respectively 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted “hr1” also known as the “tax cuts and jobs act” the “tax act” materially impacting our 2017 consolidated financial statements this change in us tax law included a reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 for years beginning after 2017 which resulted in the remeasurement of our us net deferred income tax liabilities based upon a preliminary assessment of the expected impact of the tax act we recorded a provisional tax benefit of 819 million as a result of the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities in addition excluding the impact of any discrete items we expect our effective income tax rate for 2018 to be approximately 21 which includes an estimated 55 benefit because of the tax act’s enactment some components of the tax act’s impact on 2018 were taken into consideration provisionally based upon reasonable estimates of future tax positions we will continue to analyze the tax act to determine the full effects of the new law including any further treasury regulations as they are 

  

issued but we believe the future impact on the effective income tax rate will be positive the ultimate impact of the tax act on our effective tax rate will largely depend on the percentage of pretax income generated in the us as compared to the rest of the world 

in september 2016 the united kingdom enacted provisions the so called “antihybrid provisions” effective for years beginning january 1 2017 that resulted in changes to our internal financing structure which did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements in addition in october 2016 the us treasury issued final section 385 debtequity regulations that may impact our internal financings in future years pursuant to a recent executive order the treasury department reviewed these regulations and determined to delay but retain these regulations subject to further review after enactment of us tax reform 

our effective income tax rate fluctuates based on among other factors changes in pretax income in countries with varying statutory tax rates the us domestic production activity deduction changes in valuation allowances changes in foreign exchange gainslosses the amount of exempt income and changes in unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions our exempt income primarily includes interest income export incentives and equity earnings of joint ventures the interest income is earned by certain of our european subsidiaries through intercompany financings and is either untaxed or taxed at rates substantially lower than the us statutory rate the export incentives relate to tax benefits derived from elections and structures available for us exports the equity earnings are attributable to our joint ventures and these earnings when paid through dividends to certain european subsidiaries are eligible for participation exemptions which exempt the dividend payments from all or portions of normal statutory income tax rates we currently anticipate the favorable treatment for the interest income and dividends to continue in the near term however this treatment is based on current law and tax rulings which could change the foreign exchange gainslosses have a permanent impact on our effective income tax rate that can cause unpredictable movement in our effective income tax rate we continue to maintain valuation allowances in various jurisdictions totaling 96 million which could impact our effective income tax rate in the future 

2017— the 2017 effective income tax rate which was lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35 was favorably impacted by the remeasurement of us net deferred tax liabilities due to the enactment of the tax act 149 exempt income 70 earnings in various countries notably in europe with lower statutory tax rates 30 and the us domestic production activity deduction 10 these favorable items were partially offset by the effects of us state and local income taxes 07 and changes in uncertain tax positions 05 although the tax act lowered the us statutory federal income tax rate to 21 for tax years beginning after 2017 the reconciliation uses the 35 rate in effect for the year ended december 31 2017 

2016— the 2016 effective income tax rate which was lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35 was favorably impacted by exempt income 67 earnings in various countries notably in europe with lower statutory tax rates 30 the impact of a change in nonus tax law on our deferred tax liabilities 10 and the us domestic production activity deduction 08 these favorable items were partially offset by the effects of noncash outofperiod adjustments 25 and us state and local income taxes 05 

our 2016 income tax provision includes 135 million of noncash out of period adjustments from prior years for further information on these adjustments please see note 17 

2015— the 2015 effective income tax rate which was lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35 was favorably impacted by exempt income 51 earnings in various countries notably in europe with lower statutory tax rates 21 and the us domestic production activity deduction 14 these favorable items were partially offset by the effects of us state and local income taxes 10 

comprehensive income— we had comprehensive income of 5105 million in 2017 3763 million in 2016 and 4064 million in 2015 

  

2017 versus 2016— the 1342 million increase in comprehensive income in 2017 relative to 2016 reflects higher net income the net favorable impacts of unrealized net changes in foreign currency translation adjustments and actuarial losses related to our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans these increases were offset by an unfavorable impact of financial derivative instruments recognized in 2017 

the predominant functional currency for our operations outside of the us is the euro relative to the us dollar the value of the euro increased during 2017 resulting in net gains as reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income these net gains in 2017 include pretax losses of 288 million which represent the effective portion of our net investment hedges 

we recognized net actuarial gains of 74 million in 2017 and net actuarial losses of 188 million in 2016 the 74 million net gain in 2017 reflects 74 million of gains due to changes in pension and other postretirement benefit discount rate assumptions and 6 million of gains due to favorable postretirement liability experience and other immaterial items these gains were partly offset by 7 million of losses due to pension asset experience actual asset return compared to expected return in 2016 the 188 million net loss was primarily attributable to 279 million of losses due to pension and other postretirement benefit discount rate decreases which was offset by 79 million of gains related to pension asset experience and 10 million due to favorable postretirement liability experience and other immaterial items in 2016 we also recognized a 61 million reclassification adjustment related primarily to a voluntary lump sum program offered to certain former employees in select us pension plans total lump sum payments from these plans exceeded annual service and interest cost in 2016 resulting in this loss 

the cumulative effects of our derivatives designated as cash flow hedges were losses of 323 million the euro strengthened against the us dollar in 2017 resulting in pretax losses of 287 million in 2017 related to our crosscurrency swaps pretax gains of 264 million related to our crosscurrency swaps were reclassification adjustments included in 2017 net income unrealized pretax losses of 25 million in 2017 related to forwardstarting interest rate swaps were driven by increases in benchmark interest rates during those periods 

2016 versus 2015— in 2016 comprehensive income decreased on lower net income the unfavorable impacts of financial derivative adjustments and the increase in actuarial losses related to our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized in 2016 these decreases were offset in part by the net favorable impact of unrealized net changes in foreign currency translation adjustments 

in 2016 we had a pretax gain of 43 million related to the effective portion of the unrealized gains of our financial instruments designated as net investment hedges the cumulative effect of our derivatives designated as cash flow hedges in 2016 was a loss of 29 million in 2016 cumulative losses associated with the strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar in the first half of the year resulted in a pretax loss of 15 million related to our crosscurrency swaps an unrealized loss of 17 million in 2016 related to forwardstarting interest rate swaps was driven by decreases in benchmark interest rates during that period 

a pretax loss of 63 million related to our crosscurrency swaps was a reclassification adjustment included in net income in 2016 

in 2016 and 2015 we recognized net actuarial losses of 188 million and 8 million respectively the 188 million net loss in 2016 reflects 279 million of losses due to pension and other postretirement benefit discount rate decreases offset by 79 million of gains related to pension asset experience and 10 million due to favorable postretirement liability experience and other immaterial items in 2015 the 8 million net loss was primarily attributable to 133 million of actual asset return less than the expected return this loss was offset by gains due to 73 million of discount rate increases and 50 million of gains due to favorable liability experience and healthcare assumptions in 2016 we also recognized a 61 million reclassification adjustment related primarily to a voluntary lump sum program offered to certain former employees in select us pension plans 

  

total lump sum payments from these plans exceeded annual service and interest cost in 2016 resulting in this loss 

see “critical accounting policies” below and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the key assumptions included in calculating the discount rate and expected return on plan assets 

segment analysis 

we use earnings before interest income taxes and depreciation and amortization “ebitda” as our measure of profitability for segment reporting purposes this measure of segment operating results is used by our chief operating decision maker to assess the performance of and allocate resources to our operating segments intersegment eliminations and items that are not directly related or allocated to business operations are included in “other” for additional information related to our operating segments as well as a reconciliation of ebitda to its nearest generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” measure income from continuing operations before income taxes see note 21 segment and related information  to our consolidated financial statements 

  

our continuing operations are divided into five reportable segments op—americas op—eai id refining and technology the following tables reflect selected financial information for our reportable segments 

 

   

olefins and polyolefins—americas segment 

overview —in calculating the impact of margin and volume on ebitda consistent with industry practice management offsets revenues and volumes related to ethylene coproducts against the cost to produce ethylene volume and price impacts of ethylene coproducts are reported in margin ethylene is a major building block of olefins and polyolefins and as such management assesses the performance of the segment based on ethylene sales volumes and prices and our internal cost of ethylene production 

2017 versus 2016— ebitda improved in 2017 due to higher olefins volumes stemming from the expansion of our corpus christi texas olefins facility in late 2016 higher olefins and polyethylene margins in 2017 were offset by lower polypropylene margins ebitda for 2017 also included a 31 million gain on the sale of our lake charles louisiana site ebitda for 2016 included a 57 million gain on the first quarter sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary and a 29 million noncash lcm inventory valuation charge recognized in the fourth quarter due primarily to a reduction in polypropylene prices 

2016 versus 2015— ebitda in 2016 reflects lower olefins and polyethylene results partially offset by improved polypropylene results 

ebitda in 2016 also reflects the net benefit arising from the gain on sale of our argentine subsidiary and the noncash lcm inventory valuation charge discussed above in 2015 volatility in the benchmark prices for heavy liquids and natural gas and certain correlated products particularly ethylene and propylene which continued during most of the year led to net noncash lcm inventory valuation adjustments totaling 160 million 

ethylene raw materials —benchmark crude oil and natural gas prices generally have been indicators of the level and direction of the movement of raw material and energy costs for ethylene and its coproducts in the op—americas segment ethylene and its coproducts are produced from two major raw material groups 

 

  

 although prices of these raw materials are generally related to crude oil and natural gas prices during specific periods the relationships among these materials and benchmarks may vary significantly we have significant flexibility to vary the raw material mix and process conditions in our us olefins plants in order to maximize profitability as market prices for both feedstocks and products change 

as in recent years strong supplies from the us shale gasoil boom resulted in ethane being a preferred feedstock in our us plants in 2017 we produced 75 of our ethylene from ethane despite generally higher liquid feedstock prices strong propylene and butadiene coproduct prices at various points in the year also brought liquids into our feedslate 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the op—americas segment including income from equity investments which is a component of ebitda 

 

   

revenues —revenues increased by 1323 million or 15 in 2017 compared to 2016 and decreased by 887 million or 9 in 2016 compared to 2015 

2017 versus 2016— average sales prices for most products increased in 2017 consistent with feedstock prices that are correlated with crude oil and natural gas prices which on average increased relative to 2016 these higher sales prices were responsible for a 14 increase in 2017 revenues 

operating rates and product volumes improved in 2017 due to turnaround activities and the expansion at our corpus christi texas facility during 2016 these increased volumes were responsible for a revenue increase of 1 in 2017 

2016 versus 2015— average sales prices for ethylene and polyethylene declined in 2016 consistent with feedstock prices that are correlated to the price of natural gas which declined relative to 2015 these lower average sales prices led to a revenue decrease of 11 in that period a 2 revenue increase resulted from the improvement in 2016 product sales volumes as higher olefins sales volume supported by an increase in the level of purchases for resale during turnaround activities were only partly offset by lower polyolefins volumes the sale of our argentine subsidiary reduced 2016 revenues by 230 million 

ebitda —ebitda increased by 105 million or 4 in 2017 compared to 2016 and decreased by 784 million or 21 in 2016 compared to 2015 

2017 versus 2016—increased volumes in 2017 due largely to the expansion of our corpus christi texas olefins facility was responsible for a 5 improvement in ebitda margins were relatively unchanged in 2017 compared to 2016 due to an approximate 5 cents per pound decrease in polypropylene spreads that offset per pound increases in olefins and polyethylene spreads of a half cent and 2 cents respectively polypropylene margins declined from the high levels in 2016 on the higher cost of propylene feedstocks while the increase in olefins and polyethylene margins was attributable to higher average sales prices that more than offset the increased cost of ethylene lower income from our joint venture relative to the prior year led to a 1 decline in ebitda the net impact to ebitda of the gain on sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary in the first quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter lcm inventory valuation adjustment mentioned above was offset by the first quarter 2017 gain on sale of our lake charles louisiana site 

2016 versus 2015— lower olefin and polyethylene margins in 2016 were partially offset by higher polypropylene margins the decline in olefins margins reflected a 2 cents per pound decrease in average ethylene sales prices and an approximate 4 cents per pound increase in the cost of ethylene production driven by lower coproduct prices and an increase in the cost of ngl feedstocks polyethylene margins declined 4 cents per pound from very high levels in 2015 as average polyethylene sales prices caught up with the overall decline in the cost of ethylene feedstock after lagging feedstock cost declines in 2015 a 4 cents per pound improvement in 2016 polypropylene margins reflects the benefits of lower propylene feedstock costs and tight market conditions these olefin and polyethylene margin impacts led to a 17 decrease in ebitda during 2016 an additional 10 decline in 2016 ebitda is attributed to the impact of lower volumes related to lower ethylene production during the turnaround and expansionrelated activities at our corpus christi texas ethylene facility and a sitewide outage related to turnaround activities at our morris illinois site 

these negative impacts were partially offset by a 6 increase in 2016 ebitda primarily due to a 131 million reduction in the unfavorable lcm inventory valuation adjustment recognized in 2016 versus 2015 and to the 57 million gain on the 2016 sale of our argentine subsidiary 

olefins and polyolefins—europe asia international segment 

overview — in calculating the impact of margin and volume on ebitda consistent with industry practice management offsets revenues and volumes related to ethylene coproducts against the cost to produce ethylene 

  

volume and price impacts of ethylene coproducts are reported in margin ethylene is a major building block of our olefins and polyolefins and as such management assesses the performance of the segment based on ethylene sales volumes and prices and our internal cost of ethylene production 

2017 versus 2016— ebitda increased in 2017 compared to 2016 this improvement was driven by higher olefins margins and the impact of higher volumes across most products partly offset by lower polyethylene margins and lower income from our equity investments 

ebitda for 2017 also includes a 108 million gain on the third quarter sale of our 27 interest in geosel and a 21 million beneficial impact related to the elimination of an obligation associated with a lease in 2016 ebitda reflected gains totaling 11 million from the sales of our joint venture in japan and idled assets in australia and a 21 million gain from the sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary 

2016 versus 2015— higher ebitda in 2016 was largely the result of higher polyolefin margins offset in part by lower olefins results and reductions in polyolefins volumes due to turnaround activity and unplanned downtime 

ebitda in 2016 reflects the benefit of a 21 million gain from the sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary and 11 million of gains from the sales of our joint venture in japan and idled assets in australia ebitda in 2015 included a 30 million noncash lcm inventory valuation adjustment driven by a decline in the prices of naphtha and polyolefins 

ethylene raw materials —in europe heavy liquids are the primary raw materials for our ethylene production in recent years we have sourced advantaged ngls when the opportunity has arisen in 2017 we benefited less from advantaged feedstocks than in recent years as prices for ngls increased relative to oilbased naphtha feedstock prices 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the op—eai segment including income from equity investments which is a component of ebitda 

 

 revenues —revenues in 2017 increased by 1684 million or 16 compared to 2016 and decreased by 997 million or 9 in 2016 compared to 2015 

2017 versus 2016— average sales prices in 2017 were higher across most products as sales prices generally correlate with crude oil prices which on average increased compared to 2016 these higher average sales prices were responsible for a revenue increase of 11 in 2017 better product availability compared to 2016 which was affected by turnaround activity and inventory requirements led to higher sales volumes across most products these increased volumes resulted in a revenue increase of 3 in 2017 

foreign exchange impacts that on average were favorable for 2017 resulted in a revenue increase of 2 compared to the prior year 

2016 versus 2015— the decline in 2016 revenues comprises a 7 decrease related to lower average sales prices and a 2 reduction of sales volumes stemming from turnaround activities and unplanned outages 

  

in 2016 average sales prices for olefins and polyolefins fell following feedstock prices that declined in conjunction with the price of crude oil 

ebitda —ebitda increased by 215 million or 10 in 2017 compared to 2016 and by 242 million or 13 in 2016 compared to 2015 

2017 versus 2016 —an increase in olefin margins driven largely by a 6 cents per pound increase in ethylene sales prices was partly offset in 2017 by a 3 cents per pound decrease in european polyethylene spreads due to a more balanced european market compared to the prior year this net increase resulted in a 1 improvement in 2017 ebitda compared to 2016 the higher 2017 volumes discussed above added another 5 to ebitda favorable foreign exchange impacts in 2017 also contributed an additional 1 to ebitda the net beneficial impact of the transactions in 2016 and 2017 discussed above related to the sales of our wholly owned subsidiary joint venture interests and idled assets and the elimination of a leaserelated obligation resulted in an additional 5 increase in ebitda these increases were partially offset by a 2 decrease in ebitda driven by a reduction in income from equity investments in poland and asia in 2017 relative to very strong 2016 results 

2016 versus 2015 —in 2016 higher european polyolefins margins stemming from declining ethylene and propylene feedstock costs outpaced falling product prices and led to an 11 increase in ebitda this margin improvement in 2016 was partially offset by a 2 decrease in ebitda due largely to lower polyolefin volumes 

a 3 increase in 2016 ebitda is attributed to gains associated with the sales of a joint venture idled assets and our wholly owned argentine subsidiary as well as the absence of the 2015 lcm inventory valuation adjustment discussed above income from our equity investments also led to a 1 increase in ebitda in 2016 due to higher polyolefin margins in our european joint venture and strong operating rates in our saudi joint ventures 

intermediates and derivatives segment 

overview— improvements in 2017 ebitda for intermediate chemicals and po  derivatives were partly offset by lower results for oxyfuels and related products ebitda in 2017 also reflected an approximate 50 million unfavorable impact of charges related to precious metals catalyst financings relative to 2016 

2017 versus 2016— ebitda was higher for our id segment in 2017 relative to 2016 due to stronger margins for intermediate chemicals products supported by reduced market supply stemming from industry outages and increased demand in asia 

2016 versus 2015— operating results for 2016 were lower than in 2015 as margin compression for most products related to declining energy prices higher industry production rates and additional industry capacity was only partly offset by the impact of higher volumes 

ebitda in 2015 was negatively impacted by the recognition of 181 million of lcm inventory valuation adjustments driven by the continued decline in prices for feedstocks certain oxyfuels and related products and intermediate chemical products to levels that were lower than the carrying value of our related inventories at reporting dates throughout the year 

  

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the id segment including income from equity investments which is a component of ebitda 

 

 revenues —revenues for 2017 increased by 1246 million or 17 compared to 2016 and decreased by 546 million or 7 in 2016 compared to 2015 

2017 versus 2016— higher average sales prices in 2017 for most products which reflect the impacts of higher feedstock and energy costs and industry supply constraints were responsible for revenue increases of 17 favorable foreign exchange impacts also led to a 1 revenue increase in 2017 these increases were partially offset by a revenue decrease of 1 in 2017 primarily due to lower sales volumes for intermediate chemicals and oxyfuels and related products this volumedriven decline was largely due to reduced production associated with two major turnarounds at our botlek netherlands and channelview texas facilities 

2016 versus 2015— lower average sales prices in 2016 reflected the impacts of lower crude oil lower gasoline prices and the decline in various feedstock prices additional industry supply also negatively impacted the average sales prices for certain products during 2016 these lower sales prices in 2016 were responsible for an 11 revenue decrease 

this price driven decrease was offset in part by a 4 volumerelated revenue increase in 2016 resulting from fewer planned and unplanned production outages relative to 2015 

ebitda —ebitda increased by 157 million or 12 in 2017 compared to 2016 and decreased by 142 million or 10 in 2016 compared to 2015 

2017 versus 2016— higher intermediate chemicals and po and derivative product margins driven by higher average sales prices resulted in a 19 increase in ebitda this increase was offset in part by a 2 decline in margins for oxyfuels and related products primarily due to higher butane pricing this margin improvement was partly offset by decreases in ebitda of 4 and 1 respectively stemming from the unfavorable impacts associated with charges related to precious metals catalyst financings and the lower volumes discussed above 

2016 versus 2015— lower margins in most id products in 2016 resulted in a 30 decrease in ebitda weaker gasoline markets drove oxyfuels and related product values lower relative to butane feedstock costs and lower product prices in propylene oxide and derivatives and intermediate chemicals were driven largely by increased industry supply lower income from our equity investments in 2016 also resulted in a 1 decrease in ebitda during that period 

an ebitda increase in 2016 of 9 related to the higher volumes discussed above partially offset the negative margin impact ebitda in 2016 also reflected an increase of 12 related to the absence of the lcm inventory valuation adjustment recognized in the 2015 comparison period 

  

refining segment 

overview 

2017 versus 2016— ebitda for our refining segment benefited from higher crude processing rates in 2017 as the impacts of planned and unplanned maintenance outages were less than in 2016 higher industry margins were offset by higher maintenancerelated fixed costs in 2017 

2016 versus 2015— lower margins and reduced production due to planned and unplanned outages in 2016 as described below resulted in significantly lower results for our refining segment in 2016 as compared to 2015 ebitda in 2015 included charges totaling 177 million related to noncash charges associated with lcm inventory valuation adjustments driven by a decline of nearly 20 per barrel in crude oil prices and corresponding reductions in refined product prices 

the following table sets forth selected financial information and heavy crude processing rates for the refining segment and the us refining market margins for the applicable periods “lls” is a light crude oil while “maya” is a heavy crude oil 

 

 revenues —revenues increased by 1713 million or 33 in 2017 compared to 2016 and decreased by 1422 million or 22 in 2016 compared to 2015 

2017 versus 2016— higher product prices in 2017 largely driven by an increase in average crude oil prices of approximately 10 per barrel led to a revenue increase of 26 relative to 2016 heavy crude oil processing rates increased by 17 in 2017 leading to a volume driven revenue increase of 7 as the impacts of planned and unplanned outages and the effects of hurricane harvey in 2017 had less of an impact on processing rates than the unplanned outages in 2016 referenced below in 2017 we completed planned turnarounds on one of our crude units and our fluid catalytic converter 

2016 versus 2015— major refined product prices declined due to lower crude oil prices and to weakness relative to crude oil the average per barrel price of benchmark maya crude oil declined 759 in 2016 compared to 2015 a 16 pricerelated revenue decline in 2016 versus 2015 reflected per barrel price declines of approximately 1051 and 1077 for gasoline and distillates respectively 

the remaining 6 revenue decrease in 2016 is attributed to reduced processing rates processing declines resulted from several unplanned outages including a coker unit fire downtime at crude units with reduced processing and several utility interruptions planned turnaround activity on a crude unit and a coker unit processing train early in 2016 also contributed to lower throughput during 2016 

  

ebitda —ebitda increased by 85 million or 118 in 2017 compared to 2016 and decreased by 270 million or 79 in 2016 compared to 2015 

2017 versus 2016— increased production accounted for approximately 90 of the improvement in 2017 ebitda crude oil processing rates in 2017 were higher than 2016 as discussed above higher refining margins which were partly offset by higher maintenancerelated fixed costs accounted for the remaining 10 improvement in 2017 ebitda 

2016 versus 2015— a decline in refining margins in 2016 led to a 90 decrease in ebitda the maya 211 benchmark refining spread declined in 2016 by approximately 310 per barrel relative to 2015 this decrease was driven by per barrel declines of approximately 315 and 340 in gasoline and diesel spreads respectively and an approximate 100 reduction in the price differential between brent and maya crude oils the operating issues that drove lower crude throughput in 2016 also negatively impacted margins due to a less favorably priced crude oil mix and higher variable costs per barrel 

lower production stemming from a reduction in average heavy crude oil processing rates relative to 2015 led to a decrease in ebitda in 2016 of 41 this reduction in rates was attributable to the unplanned outages crude unit operating limitations and planned turnaround activities discussed above 

the absence of the 177 million lcm inventory valuation adjustment recognized in 2015 resulted in an ebitda increase of 52 in 2016 as compared to 2015 

technology segment 

overview —the technology segment recognizes revenues related to the sale of polyolefin catalysts and the licensing of chemical and polyolefin process technologies these revenues are offset in part by the costs incurred in the production of catalysts licensing and services activities and research and development “rd” activities in 2017 2016 and 2015 our technology segment incurred approximately 55 of all rd costs 

2017 versus 2016— a decline in 2017 ebitda reflects lower licensing revenues partially offset by higher catalyst sales volumes compared to 2016 

2016 versus 2015— ebitda in 2016 improved with higher catalyst margins a small increase in licensing and services revenue was mostly offset by slightly lower catalyst sales volumes 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the technology segment 

 

 revenues —revenues decreased by 29 million or 6 in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased by 14 million or 3 in 2016 compared to 2015 

2017 versus 2016— lower licensing revenues were responsible for a revenue decrease of 12 in 2017 relative to 2016 this decrease was partially offset by revenue increases of 3 and 1 respectively related to increased catalyst sales volumes and higher average sales prices favorable foreign exchange impacts were responsible for an additional 2 increase in ebitda 

  

2016 versus 2015— higher average catalyst sales prices and higher revenues recognized on process licenses each led to a 2 increase in 2016 revenues these increases were partly offset by a 1 revenue decrease resulting from lower catalyst sales volumes 

ebitda —ebitda in 2017 decreased by 39 million or 15 compared to 2016 and increased by 19 million or 8 in 2016 compared to 2015 

2017 versus 2016— lower licensing and services revenues in 2017 were largely responsible for a 20 decrease in 2017 ebitda this decline was partly offset by a 5 improvement in ebitda resulting from an increase in catalyst volumes during 2017 

2016 versus 2015— a 10 improvement in ebitda during 2016 due to higher catalyst margins and an increase in licensing and services revenue was partly offset by a 2 decrease in ebitda resulting from lower catalyst volumes 

financial condition 

operating investing and financing activities of continuing operations which are discussed below are presented in the following table 

 

 operating activities —cash of 5206 million generated in 2017 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items partly offset by 593 million of cash used by the main components of working capital—accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable higher sales prices across all of our segments in the fourth quarter of 2017 and brief delays in the receipt of payments for products in our refining and id segments led to the increase in accounts receivable inventories increased for most products in our op—eai and op—americas segments and included an inventory build in our op–americas segment in anticipation of first quarter 2018 turnaround activities these increases were partly offset by an increase in feedstock pricing in the fourth quarter of 2017 in our op—americas op—eai and refining segments which led to an increase in accounts payable 

cash of 5606 million generated in 2016 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items and cash generated by the main components of working capital the noncash items in 2016 included a 78 million gain related to the sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary with adjustments for related working capital and gains totaling 11 million related to sales of our joint venture in japan and idled assets in australia 

the main components of working capital generated cash of 123 million in 2016 higher product sales prices in the fourth quarter of 2016 across all segments combined with the impact of higher fourth quarter 2016 sales volumes in our op—americas refining and id segments led to an increase in accounts receivable this increase in accounts receivable was offset by higher accounts payable which was driven by the higher cost of crude oil and other feedstocks the level of inventories fell in our op—americas segment following the completion of turnaround activities in the fourth quarter of 2016 and in our refining segment which had higher crude oil inventories at the end of 2015 due to operational issues during the fourth quarter 

cash of 5842 million generated in 2015 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items and cash used by the main components of working capital the main components of working capital consumed cash of 

  

246 million in 2015 the lower cost of crude oil and other feedstocks in 2015 led to a decline in accounts payable preparation for the turnaround in 2016 at our corpus christi texas facility and the unplanned maintenance outage at our houston refinery which resulted in higher levels of us olefins and crude oil inventories at year end led to the increase in consolidated inventories in 2015 accounts receivable decreased on lower average product sales prices reflective of the drop in 2015 crude oil prices 

investing activities —we invested cash of 1756 million 2301 million and 1046 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

we invest in investmentgrade and other highquality instruments that provide adequate flexibility to redeploy funds as needed to meet our cash flow requirements while maximizing yield in 2017 2016 and 2015 we invested 653 million 764 million and 2073 million respectively in securities that are classified as shortterm investments we also invested 512 million 674 million and 397 million in triparty repurchase agreements in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively we received proceeds upon the sale and maturity of certain of our shortterm investments and triparty purchase agreements of 574 million and 381 million respectively in 2017 674 million and 685 million respectively in 2016 and 2489 million and 350 million respectively in 2015 see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these investments 

joint venture activity— in september 2017 we sold our 27 interest in our geosel joint venture and received proceeds of 155 million 

in april 2017 we increased our interest in the entity that holds our equity interest in al waha petrochemicals ltd from 8379 to 100 by paying 21 million to exercise a call option to purchase the remaining 1621 interest held by a third party 

in september 2016 we purchased a net additional interest in our joint venture in korea for 36 million in february 2016 we received proceeds of 72 million for the sale of our joint venture in japan 

financial instruments activity— upon expiration in 2017 and 2016 we settled foreign currency contracts with a notional value of €550 million and €1200 million respectively which were designated as net investment hedges of our investments in foreign subsidiaries payments to and proceeds from our counterparties resulted in a net cash outflows of 49 million and 61 million during 2017 and 2016 respectively see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these foreign currency contracts 

sale of wholly owned subsidiary— in february 2016 we received net cash proceeds of 137 million for the sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary 

the following table summarizes our capital expenditures for continuing operations for the periods from 2015 through 2017 

 

   

in 2018 we expect to spend approximately 24 billion which includes contributions to our po joint ventures the higher level of expected capital expenditures in 2018 versus 2017 is largely driven by construction related to our new hyperzone polyethylene plant at our la porte texas facility and construction related to our new potba plant in texas 

in 2017 and 2016 capital expenditures included construction related to our new hyperzone polyethylene plant construction related to our new potba debottlenecks of certain assets to enhance production turnaround activities at several sites as well as other plant improvement projects the lower level of capital expenditures in 2017 versus 2016 for our op—americas segment is largely due to the completion of the 800 million pound ethylene expansion at our corpus christi texas facility in the fourth quarter of 2016 

financing activities —financing activities used cash of 2859 million 3349 million and 4850 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

we made payments totaling 866 million 2938 million and 4656 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively to acquire a portion of our outstanding ordinary shares we also made dividend payments totaling 1415 million 1395 million and 1410 million to our shareholders in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively for additional information related to these share repurchases and dividend payments see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

through the issuance and repurchase of commercial paper instruments under our commercial paper program we made net repayments of 493 million in 2017 and received net proceeds of 177 million and 61 million in 2016 and 2015 respectively 

in march 2017 we issued 1000 million of 35 guaranteed notes due 2027 and received net proceeds of 990 million the proceeds from these notes together with available cash were used to repay 1000 million of our outstanding 5 senior notes due 2019 we paid 65 million in premiums in connection with this prepayment 

in march 2016 we issued €750 million of 1875 guaranteed notes due 2022 and received net proceeds of 812 million in march 2015 we issued 1000 million of 4625 senior notes due 2055 and received net proceeds of 984 million 

additional information related to our commercial paper program and the issuance and repayment of debt can be found in the liquidity and capital resources section below and in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources —as of december 31 2017 we had 2830 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities classified as shortterm investments we also held 570 million of triparty repurchase agreements classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets at december 31 2017 for additional information related to our purchases of marketable securities which currently include time deposits certificates of deposit commercial paper bonds and limited partnership investments and our investments in triparty repurchase agreements see “investing activities” above and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

at december 31 2017 we held 557 million of cash in jurisdictions outside the us principally in the united kingdom there are currently no material legal or economic restrictions that would impede our transfers of cash 

  

we also had total unused availability under our credit facilities of 3400 million at december 31 2017 which included the following 

 

  

 we have 413 million of outstanding letters of credit bank guarantees and surety bonds issued under uncommitted credit facilities at december 31 2017 at december 31 2017 we had total debt including current maturities of 8619 million 

in accordance with our current interest rate risk management strategy and subject to management’s evaluation of market conditions and the availability of favorable interest rates among other factors we may from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements to economically convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to variable rate debt or convert a portion of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt for information related to our senior notes and guaranteed notes and credit facilities including terms of redemption see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

in may 2017 our shareholders approved a proposal to authorize us to repurchase up to an additional 10 or approximately 40 million of our shares outstanding through november 2018 “may 2017 share repurchase program” as a result the authorization of the remaining unpurchased shares under the share repurchase program approved by our shareholders in may 2016 “may 2016 share repurchase program” was suspended our share repurchase program does not have a stated dollar amount and purchases may be made through open market purchases private market transactions or other structured transactions repurchased shares could be retired or used for general corporate purposes including for various employee benefit and compensation plans in 2017 we have purchased approximately 10 million shares under these programs for approximately 845 million as of february 20 2018 we had approximately 34 million shares remaining under the current authorization the timing and amount of additional shares repurchased will be determined by our management board based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors for additional information related to our share repurchase programs see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

we may repay or redeem our debt including purchases of our outstanding bonds in the open market using cash and cash equivalents cash from our shortterm investments and triparty repurchase agreements cash from operating activities proceeds from the issuance of debt proceeds from asset divestitures or a combination thereof in connection with any repayment or redemption of our debt we may incur cash and noncash charges which could be material in the period in which they are incurred 

in july 2017 we announced our final investment decision to build a worldscale potba plant in texas with a capacity of 1 billion pounds of po and 22 billion pounds of tba the project is estimated to cost approximately 24 billion with construction estimated to commence in the second half of 2018 we anticipate the project to be completed in the middle of 2021 

we plan to fund our ongoing working capital capital expenditures debt service and other funding requirements with cash from operations which could be affected by general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory business and other factors many of which are beyond our control cash and cash 

  

equivalents cash from our shortterm investments and triparty repurchase agreements cash from operating activities proceeds from the issuance of debt or a combination thereof may be used to fund the purchase of shares under our share repurchase program 

we intend to continue to declare and pay quarterly dividends with the goal of increasing the dividend over time after giving consideration to our cash balances and expected results from operations 

as discussed in note 23 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements subsequent to our 2017 fiscal year end we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a schulman we plan to use cashonhand to fund the acquisition 

we believe that our current liquidity availability and cash from operating activities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due 

contractual and other obligations —the following table summarizes as of december 31 2017 our minimum payments for longterm debt including current maturities shortterm debt and contractual and other obligations for the next five years and thereafter 

 

 total debt —our debt includes unsecured senior notes guaranteed notes and various other us and nonus loans see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of covenant requirements under the credit facilities and indentures and additional information regarding our debt facilities 

interest on total debt —our debt and related party debt agreements contain provisions for the payment of monthly quarterly or semiannual interest at a stated rate of interest over the term of the debt 

pension and other postretirement benefits —we maintain several defined benefit pension plans as described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements many of our us and nonus plans are subject to minimum funding requirements however the amounts of required future contributions for all our plans are not fixed and can vary significantly due to changes in economic assumptions liability experience and investment return on plan assets as a result we have excluded pension and other postretirement benefit obligations from the contractual and other obligations table above our annual contributions may include amounts in excess of minimum required funding levels contributions to our nonus plans in years beyond 2018 are not expected to be materially different than the expected 2018 contributions disclosed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2017 the projected benefit obligation for our pension plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by 903 million subject to future actuarial gains and losses as well as future asset earnings we together with our consolidated subsidiaries will be required to fund the discounted obligation of 903 million in future years we contributed 103 million 114 million and 107 million to our pension plans in 2017 2016 and 

  

2015 respectively we provide other postretirement benefits primarily medical benefits to eligible participants as described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements we pay other unfunded postretirement benefits as incurred 

advances from customers —we are obligated to deliver products in connection with longterm sales agreements under which advances from customers were received in prior years these advances are treated as deferred revenue and will be amortized to earnings as product is delivered over the remaining terms of the respective contracts which range predominantly from 1 to 15 years the unamortized longterm portion of such advances totaled 44 million as of december 31 2017 

other —other primarily consists of accruals for environmental remediation costs obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and anticipated asset retirement obligations see “critical accounting policies” below for a discussion of obligations for environmental remediation costs 

deferred income taxes —the scheduled settlement of the deferred tax liabilities shown in the table is based on the scheduled reversal of the underlying temporary differences actual cash tax payments will vary depending upon future taxable income see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our deferred tax liabilities 

purchase obligations —we are party to various obligations to purchase products and services principally for raw materials utilities and industrial gases these commitments are designed to assure sources of supply and are not expected to be in excess of normal requirements the commitments are segregated into takeorpay contracts and other contracts under the takeorpay contracts we are obligated to make minimum payments whether or not we take the product or service other contracts include contracts that specify minimum quantities however in the event that we do not take the contractual minimum we are only obligated for any resulting economic loss suffered by the vendor the payments shown for the other contracts assume that minimum quantities are purchased for contracts with variable pricing terms the minimum payments reflect the contract price at december 31 2017 

operating leases —we lease various facilities and equipment under noncancelable lease arrangements for various periods see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for related lease disclosures 

current business outlook 

over the past several months strong global demand and delays in capacity additions across the industry have improved the outlook for 2018 we look forward to realizing the benefits of strong operating rates across our broad portfolio of assets and continuing the improvement in the reliability and profitability of our houston refinery 

unusually cold weather on the us gulf coast in the third week of january caused industry disruptions the impact of these disruptions which also affected our assets is currently expected to negatively impact our ebitda by approximately 45 million about two thirds of this impact is expected to be borne by our op—americas segment with the remaining impact negatively affecting our id segment planned maintenance scheduled for one cracker at our channelview texas facility is also expected to negatively impact our op—americas ebitda by approximately 50 million in each of the first and second quarters of 2018 our id segment is expected to benefit from continued strength in the market for oxyfuels and related products we expect to continue the improvement in reliability and profitability of our houston refinery in 2018 

over the coming years we will advance our growth by increasing the pace of organic business investments while diligently pursuing valueadding inorganic opportunities 

  

related party transactions 

we have related party transactions with our joint venture partners we believe that such transactions are effected on terms substantially no more or less favorable than those that would have been agreed upon by unrelated parties on an arm’s length basis see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional related party disclosures 

critical accounting policies 

management applies those accounting policies that it believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the us see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements our more critical accounting policies include those related to the valuation of inventory longlived assets the valuation of goodwill accruals for longterm employee benefit costs such as pension and other postretirement costs and accruals for taxes based on income inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management management periodically updates its estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment 

inventory —we account for our inventory using the lastin firstout “lifo” method of accounting 

the cost of raw materials which represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses and energy costs generally follow price trends for crude oil andor natural gas crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to many factors including changes in economic conditions 

since our inventory consists of manufactured products derived from crude oil natural gas natural gas liquids and correlated materials as well as the associated feedstocks and intermediate chemicals our inventory market values are generally influenced by changes in benchmark crude oil and heavy liquid values and prices for manufactured finished goods the degree of influence of a particular benchmark may vary from period to period as the composition of the dollar value lifo pools change due to natural inventory composition changes variation in pricing from period to period does not necessarily result in a linear lcm impact additionally an lcm condition may arise due to a volumetric decline in a particular material that had previously provided a positive impact within a pool as a result market valuations and lcm conditions are dependent upon the composition and mix of materials on hand at the balance sheet date in the measurement of an lcm adjustment the numeric input value for determining the crude oil market price includes pricing that is weighted by volume of inventories held at a point in time including wti brent and maya crude oils 

as indicated above fluctuation in the prices of crude oil natural gas and correlated products from period to period may result in the recognition of charges to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in periods of falling prices and the reversal of those charges in subsequent interim periods as market prices recover accordingly our cost of sales and results of operations may be affected by such fluctuations 

during 2015 and 2016 we incurred lcm inventory adjustments of 548 million and 29 million respectively in 2015 the lcm adjustments were driven by declines in the prices of crude oil ethylene propylene benzene and etbe the 2016 adjustment which occurred in the fourth quarter was driven by a decline in the price of propylene as a result of the impairments charges taken in 2014 2015 and 2016 all of our inventory pools are valued at 2015 or 2016 yearend market prices prior to indexation while prices for our products and raw materials are inherently volatile and therefore no prediction can be given with certainty we do not believe any of our inventory is at risk for impairment at this time 

goodwill —goodwill of 570 million at december 31 2017 represents the tax effect of the differences between the tax and book bases of our assets and liabilities resulting from the revaluation of those assets and liabilities to fair value in connection with the company’s emergence from bankruptcy and adoption of freshstart 

  

accounting we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill of a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable 

we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors assessed for each of the reporting units include but are not limited to changes in longterm commodity prices discount rates competitive environments planned capacity cost factors such as raw material prices and financial performance of the reporting units if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a quantitative test is required 

we also have the option to proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test under the quantitative impairment test the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill for the quantitative impairment test the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated using a discounted cashflow model such a model inherently utilizes a significant number of estimates and assumptions including operating margins tax rates discount rates capital expenditures and working capital changes if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value an impairment charge equal to the excess would be recognized 

for 2017 and 2016 management performed a qualitative impairment assessment of our reporting units which indicated that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their carrying value accordingly a quantitative goodwill impairment test was not required accordingly no goodwill impairment was recognized in 2017 or 2016 

longterm employee benefit costs —our costs for longterm employee benefits particularly pension and other postretirement medical and life insurance benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is management’s responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent its best estimates of the future effects of those uncertainties it also is management’s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 

the current benefit service costs as well as the existing liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis the discount rate is a current rate related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled our assumed discount rate is based on yield information for highquality corporate bonds with durations comparable to the expected cash settlement of our obligations for the purpose of measuring the benefit obligations at december 31 2017 we used a weighted average discount rate of 373 for the us plans which reflects the different terms of the related benefit obligations the weighted average discount rate used to measure obligations for nonus plans at december 31 2017 was 213 reflecting market interest rates the discount rates in effect at december 31 2017 will be used to measure net periodic benefit cost during 2018 

the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of other postretirement medical benefits are also measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits as of december 31 2017 the assumed rate of increase for our us plans was 67 decreasing to 45 in 2038 and thereafter a one hundred basis point change in the health care cost trend rate assumption as of december 31 2017 would have resulted in a 18 million increase or 12 million decrease in the accumulated other postretirement benefit liability for our nonus plans and would have resulted in an increase or decrease of less than 1 million for us plans due to limits on our maximum contribution level under the medical plan there would have been no significant effect on either our benefit liability or net periodic cost 

  

the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption investment returns that are recognized currently in net income represent the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets applied to a marketrelated value of plan assets which for us is defined as the market value of assets the expected rate of return on plan assets is a longerterm rate and is expected to change less frequently than the current assumed discount rate reflecting longterm market expectations rather than current fluctuations in market conditions 

the weighted average expected longterm rate of return on assets in our us plans of 800 is based on the average level of earnings that our independent pension investment advisor had advised could be expected to be earned over time and 215 for our nonus plan assets is based on an expectation and asset allocation that varies by region in 2018 the average expected longterm rate of return on assets in our us plans is expected to be 750 the asset allocations are summarized in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements the actual returns in 2017 were gains of 1445 and 882 for our us and nonus plan assets respectively 

the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets management’s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 

net periodic pension cost recognized each year includes the expected asset earnings rather than the actual earnings or loss along with other gains and losses this unrecognized amount to the extent it cumulatively exceeds 10 of the projected benefit obligation for the respective plan is recognized as additional net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service period of the participants in each plan 

the following table reflects the sensitivity of the benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans to changes in the actuarial assumptions 

 

 the sensitivity of our postretirement benefit plans obligations and net periodic benefit costs to changes in actuarial assumptions are reflected in the following table 

 

 additional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

accruals for taxes based on income —the determination of our provision for income taxes and the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities is subject to management’s estimates and judgments due to the complexity of the tax laws and regulations in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of these complex laws and regulations 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse at december 31 2017 the measurement of our deferred tax balances was materially affected by the us enactment of “hr1” also known as the tax act as explained in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

we recognize future tax benefits to the extent that the realization of these benefits is more likely than not our current provision for income taxes is impacted by the recognition and release of valuation allowances related to net deferred assets in certain jurisdictions further changes to these valuation allowances may impact our future provision for income taxes which will include no tax benefit with respect to losses incurred and no tax expense with respect to income generated in these countries until the respective valuation allowance is eliminated 

we recognize the financial statement benefits with respect to an uncertain income tax position that we have taken or may take on an income tax return when we believe it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities for a position that is likely to be sustained the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest cumulative amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of lyondellbasell industries nv’s management of commodity price risk foreign currency exposure and interest rate risk through its use of derivative instruments and hedging activities 

commodity price risk 

a substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change accordingly product margins and the level of our profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the business cycle we try to protect against such instability through various business strategies these include provisions in sales contracts allowing us to pass on higher raw material costs through timely price increases formula price contracts to transfer or share commodity price risk and increasing the depth and breadth of our product portfolio 

in addition we use commodity swap and futures contracts with various terms to manage a small portion of the volatility related to raw materials and product purchases and sales such contracts are generally limited to durations of one year or less hedge accounting has been elected for some of our commodity contracts in the periods presented market risks created by these derivative instruments and the marktomarket valuations of open positions are considered by management prior to execution and monitored regularly 

  

the estimated fair value and notional amounts of our open commodity futures contracts and swap contracts are shown in the table below 

 

 we use value at risk “var” stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes 

var estimates the maximum potential loss in fair market values given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time using specified confidence levels 

using sensitivity analysis and hypothetical changes in market prices ranging from 9 to 13 which represent a threemonth volatility range of the underlying products noted in the table above the effect on our pretax income would be approximately 1 million the quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account the effects of the underlying operating transactions 

foreign exchange risk 

we manufacture and market our products in many countries throughout the world and as a result are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

a significant portion of our reporting entities use the euro as their functional currency our reporting currency is the us dollar the translation gains or losses that result from the process of translating the euro denominated financial statements to us dollars are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” until such time as those entities may be liquidated or sold changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro can therefore have a significant impact on comprehensive income 

we have entered into hedging arrangements designated as net investment hedges to reduce the volatility in stockholders’ equity resulting from foreign currency fluctuation associated with our net investments in foreign operations the table below illustrates the impact on other comprehensive loss of a 10 fluctuation in the foreign currency rate associated with each net investment hedge and the euribor and libor rates associated with basis swaps are shown in the table below 

 

 some of our operations enter into transactions that are not denominated in their functional currency this results in exposure to foreign currency risk for financial instruments including but not limited to third party and intercompany receivables and payables and intercompany loans 

we maintain risk management control practices to monitor the foreign currency risk attributable to our intercompany and third party outstanding foreign currency balances these practices involve the centralization of our exposure to underlying currencies that are not subject to central bank andor country specific restrictions by centralizing most of our foreign currency exposure into one subsidiary we are able to take advantage of any natural offsets thereby reducing the overall impact of changes in foreign currency rates on our earnings at december 31 2017 a 10 fluctuation compared to the us dollar in the underlying currencies that have no central bank or other currency restrictions related to nonhedged monetary net assets would have had a resulting additional impact to earnings of approximately 2 million 

our policy is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies to minimize exchange gains and losses arising from changes in exchange rates to minimize the effects of our net currency exchange exposures we enter into foreign currency spot and forward contracts and in some cases crosscurrency swaps 

we also engage in shortterm foreign exchange swaps in order to roll certain hedge positions and to make funds available for intercompany financing our net position in foreign currencies is monitored daily 

we have entered into 2300 million of noncancellable crosscurrency swaps which we designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges to reduce the variability in the functional currency equivalent cash flows of certain foreign currency denominated intercompany notes at december 31 2017 these foreign currency contracts have maturity dates ranging from 2021 to 2027 and their fair value was a net liability of 4 million a 10 fluctuation compared to the us dollar would have had a resulting additional impact to other comprehensive income loss of approximately 265 million 

other income net in the consolidated statements of income reflected losses of 1 million 4 million and 7 million for 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively in net exchange rate gains and losses for forward contracts including swap transactions that economically hedge recognized monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies no hedge accounting is applied changes in the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are reported in the consolidated statements of income and offset the currency exchange results recognized on the 

  

assets and liabilities at december 31 2017 these foreign currency contracts which will mature in january 2018 had an aggregated notional amount of 1014 million and the fair value was a net liability of 11 million a 10 fluctuation compared to the us dollar would have had a resulting additional impact to earnings of approximately 10 million 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk management is viewed as a tradeoff between cost and risk the cost of interest is generally lower for shortterm debt and higher for longterm debt and lower for floating rate debt and higher for fixed rate debt however the risk associated with interest rates is inversely related to the cost with shortterm debt carrying a higher refinancing risk and floating rate debt having higher interest rate volatility our interest rate risk management strategy attempts to optimize this costriskreward tradeoff 

we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our fixed and variable rate debt fluctuations in interest rates impact the fair value of fixedrate debt as well as pretax earnings stemming from interest expense on variablerate debt to minimize earnings at risk we target to maintain floating rate debt equal to our cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and triparty repurchase agreements as those assets are invested in floating rate instruments as part of our interest rate risk management strategy we also enter into interest rate swaps 

preissuance interest rate —a preissuance interest rate strategy is utilized to mitigate the risk that benchmark interest rates ie us treasury midswaps etc will increase between the time a decision has been made to issue debt and when the actual debt offering transpires in march 2015 we entered into forwardstarting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of adverse changes in the benchmark interest rates on the anticipated refinancing of our senior notes due 2019 these interest rate swaps will be terminated upon debt issuance at december 31 2017 the total notional amount of these interest rate contracts designated as cash flow hedges was 1000 million and its fair value was a net liability of 41 million we estimate that a 10 change in market interest rates as of december 31 2017 would change the fair value of our forwardstarting interest rate swap outstanding and would have had a resulting impact on other comprehensive income loss of approximately 47 million 

fixedrate debt —we entered into interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy at december 31 2017 the total notional amount of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges which have maturity dates ranging from 2019 to 2027 was 3000 million and their fair value was a net liability of 1 million 

at december 31 2017 after giving consideration to the 3000 million of fixedrate debt that we have effectively converted to floating through these us dollar fixedforfloating interest rate swaps approximately 66 of our debt portfolio on a gross basis incurred interest at a fixedrate and the remaining 34 of the portfolio incurred interest at a variablerate we estimate that a 10 change in market interest rates as of december 31 2017 would change the fair value of our interest rate swaps outstanding and would have had a resulting impact on our pretax income of approximately 29 million 

variablerate debt —our variable rate debt consists of our 2500 million senior revolving credit facility our 900 million us receivables securitization facility and our commercial paper program at december 31 2017 there were no outstanding borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility us receivables securitization facility or our commercial paper program we estimate that a 10 change in interest rates would have had less than a 1 million impact on earnings based on our average variablerate debt outstanding per year

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

overview 

lyondellbasell industries nv is a global independent chemical company and was incorporated under dutch law on october 15 2009 unless otherwise indicated the “company” “we” “our” “us” and “lyondellbasell” are used in this report to refer to the businesses of lyondellbasell industries nv and its consolidated subsidiaries we are one of the world’s top five independent chemical companies based on revenues 

we participate globally across the petrochemical value chain and are an industry leader in many of our product lines our chemicals businesses consist primarily of large processing plants that convert large volumes of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon feedstocks into plastic resins and other chemicals our chemical products tend to be basic building blocks for other chemicals and plastics while our plastic products are typically used in large volume applications our customers use our plastics and chemicals to manufacture a wide range of products that people use in their everyday lives including food packaging home furnishings automotive components paints and coatings our refining business consists of our houston refinery which processes crude oil into refined products such as gasoline diesel and jet fuel 

our financial performance is influenced by the supply and demand for our products the cost and availability of feedstocks global and regional competitor capacity our operational efficiency and our ability to control costs we have a strong operational focus and as a producer of large volume commodities continuously strive to differentiate ourselves through safe reliable and lowcost operations in all our businesses we purchase large quantities of natural gas electricity and steam which we use as energy to fuel our facilities we also purchase large quantities of natural gas and crude oil derivatives which we use as feedstocks during recent years the cost of natural gasderived raw materials in the us versus the global cost of crude oilderived raw materials has had a significant positive influence on the profitability of our north american operations while the north american feedstock advantage has declined more recently with lower oil prices and resulting lower olefin prices improved product supply and demand fundamentals in several businesses notably global polyolefins products have partially offset the decline 

segments 

we manage our operations through five operating segments our reportable segments are 

 

  

  

  

  

 financial information about our business segments and geographical areas can be found in note 22 segment and related information  to the consolidated financial statements information about the locations where we produce our primary products can be found under “description of properties” 

  

in 2016 2015 and 2014 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues 

olefins and polyolefins segments generally 

we are one of the leading worldwide producers of olefins and polyethylene “pe” and we are the world’s second largest producer of polypropylene “pp” we manage our olefin and polyolefin business in two reportable segments op—americas and op—eai 

olefins   coproducts —ethylene is the most significant petrochemical in terms of worldwide production volume and is the key building block for pe and a large number of other chemicals plastics and synthetics ethylene is produced by steam cracking hydrocarbons such as ethane and propane as well as naphtha this production results in coproducts such as aromatics and other olefins including propylene and butadiene ethylene and its coproducts are fundamental to many parts of the economy including the production of consumer products packaging housing and automotive components and other durable and nondurable goods 

polyolefins —the term polyolefins includes pe and pp and they are derived from ethylene and propylene polyolefins are the most used thermoplastics in the world and are used in wideranging applications and products and enhance everyday quality of life our products are used in consumer automotive and industrial applications ranging from food and beverage packaging to housewares and construction materials 

polyethylene —we produce high density polyethylene “hdpe” low density polyethylene “ldpe” and linear low density polyethylene “lldpe” pe sales accounted for approximately 24 21 and 18 of our total revenues in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

polypropylene —we produce pp homopolymers pp impact copolymers and pp random copolymers pp compounds are produced from blends of polyolefins and additives and are sold mainly to the automotive and home appliances industries pp sales accounted for approximately17 of our total revenues in 2016 and 2015 and 16 in 2014 

olefins and polyolefins—americas segment 

overview 

our op—americas segment produces and markets olefins and coproducts polyethylene and polypropylene 

sales  marketing  customers 

the majority of the ethylene we produce is consumed internally as a raw material in the production of pe and other derivatives with the balance sold to third party customers under multiyear contracts or on a spot basis in the last two years we have added 111 billion pounds of ethylene capacity at our gulf coast facilities 

we use all of the propylene that we produce in the production of pp propylene oxide and other derivatives as a result we also purchase propylene from third parties in addition to purchases of propylene at times we purchase ethylene for resale when necessary to satisfy customer demand above our own production levels volumes of any of these products purchased for resale can vary significantly from period to period and are typically most significant during extended outages of our own production such as during planned turnarounds however purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profits except to the extent that they replace lowercost production 

most of the ethylene and propylene production of our channelview corpus christi and la porte texas facilities is shipped via a pipeline system which has connections to numerous us gulf coast consumers this pipeline extends from corpus christi to mont belvieu texas in addition exchange agreements with other 

  

ethylene and coproducts producers allow access to customers who are not directly connected to this pipeline system some ethylene is shipped by rail car from our clinton iowa facility to our morris illinois facility and some is shipped directly to customers some propylene is shipped by ocean going vessel barge railcar and truck 

our pp and pe production is typically sold through our sales organization to an extensive base of established customers and distributors servicing both the domestic and export markets either under annual contracts or on a spot basis we have sales offices in various locations in north america and our polyolefins primarily are transported in north america by railcar or truck export sales are primarily to customers in central and south america with sales to asia expected to increase in the coming years as global supply and demand balances shift we also consume pp in our pp compounds business which is managed worldwide by our op—eai segment 

joint venture relationships 

we participate in a joint venture in mexico which provides us with capacity for approximately 640 million pounds of pp production the capacity is based on our percentage ownership of the joint ventures’ total capacity we do not hold a majority interest in or have operational control of this joint venture 

raw materials 

raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost for the production of ethylene and its coproducts the primary raw materials used in our americas olefin facilities are heavy liquids and natural gas liquids “ngls” heavy liquids include crude oilbased naphtha and other refined products as well as condensate a very light crude oil resulting from natural gas production ngls include ethane propane and butane the use of heavy liquid raw materials results in the production of a significant amount of coproducts such as propylene butadiene and benzene as well as gasoline blending components while the use of ngls results in the production of a smaller amount of coproducts 

our ability to pass on raw material price increases to our customers is dependent upon marketdriven demand for olefins and polyolefins sales prices for products sold in the spot market are determined by market forces our contract prices are influenced by product supply and demand conditions spot prices indices published in industry publications and in some instances cost recovery formulas 

prior to 2010 olefins facilities using heavy liquids as feedstock generated higher margins than those using ngls however technological advances for extracting shalebased oil and gas have led to an increased supply of ngls giving them a cost advantage over heavy liquids particularly in the us with reductions in oil prices since 2014 the cost advantage has declined but is still significant a plant’s flexibility to consume a wide range of raw materials generally will provide an advantage over plants that are restricted in their processing capabilities our americas’ facilities can process significant quantities of either heavy liquids or ngls we estimate that in the us we can produce up to approximately 90 of our total ethylene output using ngls changes in the raw material feedstock utilized in the production process will result in variances in production capacities among products we believe our raw material flexibility in the us is a key advantage in our production of ethylene and its coproducts 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to olefins and polyolefins competition is based on price and to a lesser extent on product quality product delivery reliability of supply product performance and customer service industry consolidation in north america has led to fewer although larger competitors profitability is affected not only by supply and demand for olefins and polyolefins but also by raw material costs and price competition among producers which may intensify due to among other things the addition of new capacity in general demand is a function of worldwide economic growth including the regional dynamics that underlie global growth trends 

  

we compete in north america with other large marketers and producers including global chemical companies chemical divisions of large oil companies and regional marketers and producers 

based on published data we believe we were as of december 31 2016 

 

  

  

 olefins and polyolefins—europe asia international segment 

overview 

our op—eai segment produces and markets olefins and coproducts polyethylene and polypropylene including pp compounds 

sales  marketing  customers 

our ethylene production is primarily consumed internally as a raw material in the production of polyolefins and we purchase additional ethylene as needed to meet our production needs our propylene production is used as a raw material in the production of pp and propylene oxide and we regularly purchase propylene from third parties because our internal needs exceed our internal production 

with respect to pp and pe our production is typically sold through our sales organization to an extensive base of established customers under annual contracts or on a spot basis and is also sold through distributors our polyolefins are transported in europe primarily by railcar or truck 

our regional sales offices are in various locations including the netherlands hong kong china india australia and the united arab emirates we also operate through a worldwide network of local sales and representative offices in europe asia and africa our joint ventures described below typically manage their domestic sales and marketing efforts independently and we typically operate as their agentdistributor for all or a portion of their exports 

joint venture relationships 

we participate in several manufacturing joint ventures in saudi arabia thailand poland australia and south korea we do not hold majority interests in any of these joint ventures nor do we have operational control these ventures provide us with additional production capacity of approximately 29 billion pounds of pp approximately 14 billion pounds of olefins approximately 09 billion pounds of pe and approximately 100 million pounds of pp compounds these capacities are based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint ventures’ total capacities we realize profits or losses from these ventures as income or loss on the equity basis of accounting 

we generally license our polyolefin process technologies and supply catalysts to our joint ventures through our technology segment some of our joint ventures are able to source cost advantaged raw materials from their local shareholders 

raw materials 

raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost for the production of olefins and coproducts the primary raw material used in our european olefin facilities is naphtha however in recent years we have 

  

sourced increased amounts of advantaged ngls when the opportunity arises for our saudi joint venture facilities locally sourced and cost advantaged ngls including ethane propane and butane are used the principal raw materials used in the production of polyolefins are propylene and ethylene in europe we have the capacity to produce approximately 50 of the propylene requirements for our european pp production and all of the ethylene requirements for our european pe production propylene and ethylene requirements that are not produced internally are generally acquired pursuant to longterm contracts with third party suppliers or via spot purchases 

our pp compounds facilities receive the majority of their pp raw materials from one of our wholly owned or joint venture facilities some of our joint ventures receive propylene and ethylene from their local shareholders under longterm contracts 

our ability to pass through the increased cost of raw materials to customers is dependent on global market demand for olefins and polyolefins in general the pricing for purchases and sales of most products is determined by global market forces including the impacts of foreign exchange on the pricing of the underlying naphtha raw materials most of which are priced in us dollars there can be a lag between naphtha raw material price changes and contract product price changes that will cause volatility in our product margins 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to olefins and polyolefins competition is based on price product quality product delivery reliability of supply product performance and customer service we compete with regional and multinational chemical companies and divisions of large oil companies the petrochemical market in the european union “eu” has been affected by the price volatility of naphtha the primary feedstock for olefins in the region as well as fluctuating demand as a result of changing european and global economic conditions 

based on published data and including our proportionate share of our joint ventures we believe we were as of december 31 2016 

 

  

  

 intermediates and derivatives segment 

overview 

our id segment produces and markets propylene oxide “po” and its derivatives oxyfuels and related products and intermediate chemicals such as styrene monomer “sm” acetyls and ethylene oxides and derivatives 

po and derivatives— we produce po through two distinct technologies one of which yields tertiary butyl alcohol “tba” as the coproduct and the other of which yields sm as the coproduct the two technologies are mutually exclusive with dedicated assets for manufacturing either potba or posm po is an intermediate commodity chemical and is a precursor of polyols propylene glycol propylene glycol ethers and butanediol po and derivatives are used in a variety of durable and consumables items with key applications such as urethane foams used for insulation automotivefurniture cushioning coatings surfactants synthetic resins and several other household usages 

  

oxyfuels and related products —we produce two distinct etherbased oxyfuels methyl tertiary butyl ether “mtbe” and ethyl tertiary butyl ether “etbe” these oxyfuels are produced by converting the tba coproduct of po into isobutylene and reacting with methanol or ethanol to produce either mtbe or etbe both are used as highoctane gasoline components that help gasoline burn cleaner and reduce automobile emissions other tba derivatives which we refer to as “c4 chemicals” are largely used to make synthetic rubber and other gasoline additives 

intermediate chemicals —we produce other commodity chemicals that utilize ethylene as a key component feedstock including sm acetyls and ethylene oxide derivatives sm is utilized in various applications such as plastics expandable polystyrene for packaging foam cups and containers insulation products and durables and engineering resins acetyls comprise methanol glacial acetic acid “gaa” and vinyl acetate monomer “vam” natural gas methane is the feedstock for methanol some of which is converted to gaa and a portion of the gaa is reacted with ethylene to create vam vam is an intermediate chemical used in fabric or wood treatments pigments coatings films and adhesives ethylene oxide is an intermediate chemical that is used to produce ethylene glycol glycol ethers and other derivatives ethylene oxide and its derivatives are used in the production of polyester antifreeze fluids solvents and other chemical products 

sales  marketing  customers 

we sell our po and its coproducts and derivatives through multiyear sales and processing agreements as well as spot sales some of our contract sales agreements have cost plus pricing terms po and derivatives are transported by barge ocean going vessel pipeline railcar and tank truck 

we sell our oxyfuels and related products under market and costbased sales agreements and in the spot market oxyfuels are transported by barge ocean going vessel and tank truck and are used as octane blending components worldwide outside of the united states due to their blending characteristics and emission benefits c4 chemicals such as highpurity isobutylene are sold to producers of synthetic rubber and other chemical products primarily in the united states and europe and are transported by rail truck pipeline and marine shipments 

intermediate chemicals are shipped by barge marine vessel pipeline railcar and tank truck sm is sold globally into regions such as north america europe asia and south america export markets through spot sales and commercial contracts within acetyls methanol is consumed internally to make gaa used as a feedstock for oxyfuels and related products and also sold directly into the merchant commercial market as the final conversion stage gaa is converted with ethylene to produce vam which is sold worldwide under multiyear commercial contracts and on a spot basis 

sales of our po and derivatives oxyfuels and related products and intermediate chemicals are made by our marketing and sales personnel and also through distributors and independent agents in the americas europe the middle east africa and the asia pacific region 

joint venture relationships 

we have two po joint ventures with covestro ag one in the us and one in europe we operate four of the us po production facilities for the us po joint venture covestro’s interest represents ownership of an inkind portion of the po production of 15 billion pounds per year we take inkind the remaining po production and all coproduct production the parties’ rights in the joint venture are based on offtake volumes related to actual production of po as opposed to ownership percentages covestro also has the right to 50 of the po and sm production of our european po joint venture our proportional production capacity provided through this venture is approximately 340 million pounds of po and approximately 750 million pounds of sm we do not share marketing or product sales with covestro under either of these po joint ventures 

  

we also have joint venture manufacturing relationships in china these ventures provide us with additional production capacity of approximately 115 million pounds of po this capacity is based on our operational share of the joint ventures’ total capacities 

raw materials 

the cost of raw materials is the largest component of total production cost for po its coproducts and its derivatives propylene isobutane or mixed butane ethylene and benzene are the primary raw materials used in the production of po and its coproducts the market prices of these raw materials historically have been related to the price of crude oil ngls and natural gas as well as supply and demand for the raw materials 

in the us we obtain a large portion of our propylene benzene and ethylene raw materials needed for the production of po and its coproducts from our op—americas segment and to a lesser extent from third parties raw materials for the nonus production of po and its coproducts are obtained from our op—eai segment and from third parties we consume a significant portion of our internallyproduced po in the production of po derivatives 

the raw material requirements not sourced internally are purchased at marketbased prices from numerous suppliers in the us and europe with which we have established contractual relationships as well as in the spot market 

for the production of oxyfuels we purchase our ethanol feedstock requirements from third parties and our methanol from both internal production and external sources carbon monoxide and methanol are the primary raw materials required for the production of gaa we purchase carbon monoxide pursuant to a longterm contract with pricing primarily based on the cost of production the methanol required for our downstream production of acetyls is internally sourced from a partnership and from our methanol plant at channelview texas natural gas is the primary raw material required for the production of methanol 

in addition to ethylene acetic acid is a primary raw material for the production of vam we obtain our entire requirements for acetic acid and ethylene from our internal production historically we have used a large percentage of our acetic acid production to produce vam 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to product competition the market is influenced and based on a variety of factors including product quality price reliability of supply technical support customer service and potential substitute materials profitability is affected by the worldwide level of demand along with price competition which may intensify due to among other things new industry capacity and industry outages demand growth could be impacted by further development of alternative biobased methodologies our major worldwide competitors include other multinational chemical and refining companies as well as some regional marketers and producers 

based on published data excluding our partners’ shares of joint venture capacity we believe as of december 31 2016 we were 

 

  

 refining segment 

overview 

the primary product of our refining segment is refined products made from heavy highsulfur crude oil and other crude oils of varied types and sources available on the us gulf coast these refined products include gasoline and other distillates 

  

sales  marketing  customers 

the houston refinery’s products primarily are sold in bulk to other refiners marketers distributors and wholesalers at marketrelated prices most of the houston refinery’s products are sold under contracts with a term of one year or less or are sold in the spot market the houston refinery’s products generally are transported to customers via pipelines and terminals owned and operated by other parties 

raw materials 

our houston refinery which is located on the houston ship channel in houston texas has a heavy highsulfur crude oil processing capacity of approximately 268000 barrels per day on a calendar day basis normal operating basis or approximately 292000 barrels per day on a stream day basis maximum achievable over a 24 hour period the houston refinery is a full conversion refinery designed to refine heavy highsulfur crude oil this crude oil is more viscous and dense than traditional crude oil and contains higher concentrations of sulfur and heavy metals making it more difficult to refine into gasoline and other highvalue fuel products however this crude oil has historically been less costly to purchase than light lowsulfur crude oil such as brent 

we purchase the crude oil used as a raw material for the houston refinery on the open market on a spot basis and under a number of supply agreements with regional producers generally with terms varying from one to two years

our refining competitors are major integrated oil companies refineries owned or controlled by foreign governments and independent domestic refiners based on published data as of january 2016 there were 141 operable crude oil refineries in the us and total us refinery capacity was approximately 183 million barrels per day during 2016 the houston refinery processed an average of approximately 205000 barrels per day of crude oil 

our refining operations compete for the purchases of crude oil based on price and quality supply disruptions could impact the availability and pricing we compete in gasoline and distillate markets as a bulk supplier of fungible products satisfying industry and government specifications competition is based on price and location 

the markets for fuel products tend to be volatile as well as cyclical as a result of the changing global economy and changing crude oil and refined product prices crude oil prices are impacted by worldwide political events the economics of exploration and production and refined products demand prices and demand for fuel products are influenced by seasonal and shortterm factors such as weather and driving patterns as well as by longer term issues such as the economy energy conservation and alternative fuels industry fuel products supply is dependent on shortterm industry operating capabilities and on longterm refining capacity 

a crack spread is a benchmark indication of refining margins based on the processing of a specific type of crude oil into an assumed selection of major refined products the houston refinery generally tracks the maya 211 crack spread which represents the difference between the current month gulf coast price of two barrels of maya crude oil as set by petróleos mexicanos “pemex” and one barrel each of us gulf coast reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending “rbob” gasoline and of us gulf coast ultralowsulfur diesel “ulsd” while these benchmark refining spreads are generally indicative of the level of profitability at the houston refinery and similarly configured refineries there are many other factors specific to each refinery and the industry in general which influence operating results such as the value of refinery byproducts refinery byproducts are products other than gasoline and distillates that represent about onethird of the total product volume and include coke sulfur and lighter materials such as ngls and crude olefins streams the cost of renewable identification numbers “rins” which are epa mandated renewable fuel credits can also affect profitability 

  

technology segment 

overview 

our technology segment develops and licenses chemical and polyolefin process technologies and manufactures and sells polyolefin catalysts we market our process technologies and our polyolefin catalysts to external customers and also use them in our own manufacturing operations approximately 25 of our catalyst sales are intercompany 

our polyolefin process licenses are structured to provide a standard core technology with individual customer needs met by adding customized modules that provide the required capabilities to produce the defined production grade slate and plant capacity in addition to the basic license agreement a range of services can also be provided including project assistance training assistance in starting up the plant and ongoing technical support after startup we may also offer marketing and sales services in addition licensees may continue to purchase polyolefin catalysts that are consumed in the production process generally under longterm catalyst supply agreements with us 

research and development 

our research and development “rd” activities are designed to improve our existing products and processes and discover and commercialize new materials catalysts and processes these activities focus on product and application development process development catalyst development and fundamental polyolefin focused research 

in 2016 2015 and 2014 our rd expenditures were 99 million 102 million and 127 million respectively a portion of these expenses are related to technical support and customer service and are allocated to the other business segments in 2016 and 2015 approximately 45 of all rd costs were allocated to business segments other than technology while in 2014 the allocation approximated 35 

general 




 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 

our business including our results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected by safety or product liability issues 

failure to appropriately manage safety human health product liability and environmental risks associated with our products product life cycles and production processes could adversely impact employees communities stakeholders our reputation and our results of operations public perception of the risks associated with our products and production processes could impact product acceptance and influence the regulatory environment in which we operate while we have procedures and controls to manage safety risks issues could be created by events outside of our control including natural disasters severe weather events and acts of sabotage 

  

our operations are subject to risks inherent in chemical and refining businesses and we could be subject to liabilities for which we are not fully insured or that are not otherwise mitigated 

we maintain property business interruption product general liability casualty and other types of insurance that we believe are appropriate for our business and operations as well as in line with customary industry practices however we are not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to our business including losses resulting from natural disasters wars or terrorist acts changes in insurance market conditions have caused and may in the future cause premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies to increase substantially and in some instances for certain insurance to become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured we might not be able to finance the amount of the uninsured liability on terms acceptable to us or at all and might be obligated to divert a significant portion of our cash flow from normal business operations 

further because a part of our business involves licensing polyolefin process technology our licensees are exposed to similar risks involved in the manufacture and marketing of polyolefins hazardous incidents involving our licensees if they do result or are perceived to result from use of our technologies may harm our reputation threaten our relationships with other licensees andor lead to customer attrition and financial losses our policy of covering these risks through contractual limitations of liability and indemnities and through insurance may not always be effective as a result our financial condition and results of operation would be adversely affected and other companies with competing technologies may have the opportunity to secure a competitive advantage 

a sustained decrease in the price of crude oil may adversely impact the results of our operations primarily in north america 

energy costs generally follow price trends of crude oil and natural gas these price trends may be highly volatile and cyclical in the past raw material and energy costs have experienced significant fluctuations that adversely affected our business segments’ results of operations for example we have benefitted from the favorable ratio of us natural gas prices to crude oil prices in recent years this advantage was reduced as oil prices declined beginning in 2014 if the price of crude oil remains lower relative to us natural gas prices or if the demand for natural gas and ngls increases this may have a negative impact on our results of operations 

costs and limitations on supply of raw materials and energy may result in increased operating expenses 

the costs of raw materials and energy represent a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to the significant competition we face and the commodity nature of many of our products we are not always able to pass on raw material and energy cost increases to our customers when we do have the ability to pass on the cost increases we are not always able to do so quickly enough to avoid adverse impacts on our results of operations 

cost increases for raw materials also may increase working capital needs which could reduce our liquidity and cash flow even if we increase our sales prices to reflect rising raw material and energy costs demand for products may decrease as customers reduce their consumption or use substitute products which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition producers in natural gas costadvantaged regions such as the middle east and north america benefit from the lower prices of natural gas and ngls competition from producers in these regions may cause us to reduce exports from europe and elsewhere any such reductions may increase competition for product sales within europe and other markets which can result in lower margins in those regions 

for some of our raw materials and utilities there are a limited number of suppliers and in some cases the supplies are specific to the particular geographic region in which a facility is located it is also common in the chemical and refining industries for a facility to have a sole dedicated source for its utilities such as steam electricity and gas having a sole or limited number of suppliers may limit our negotiating power particularly in 

  

the case of rising raw material costs any new supply agreements we enter into may not have terms as favorable as those contained in our current supply agreements 

additionally there is growing concern over the reliability of water sources including around the texas gulf coast where several of our facilities are located the decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of population growth drought or regulation could negatively impact our operations 

if our raw material or utility supplies were disrupted our businesses may incur increased costs to procure alternative supplies or incur excessive downtime which would have a direct negative impact on plant operations disruptions of supplies may occur as a result of transportation issues including but not limited to as a result of natural disasters and water levels that can affect the operations of vessels barges rails trucks and pipeline traffic these risks are particularly prevalent in the us gulf coast area additionally the export of ngls from the us greater restrictions on hydraulic fracturing or the lifting by the us government of the ban on us crude oil exports could restrict the availability of our raw materials thereby increasing our costs 

with increased volatility in raw material costs our suppliers could impose more onerous terms on us resulting in shorter payment cycles and increasing our working capital requirements 

our ability to source raw materials may be adversely affected by political instability civil disturbances or other governmental actions 

we obtain a portion of our principal raw materials from sources in north africa the middle east and central and south america that may be less politically stable than other areas in which we conduct business such as europe or the us political instability civil disturbances and actions by governments in these areas are likely to substantially increase the price and decrease the supply of raw materials necessary for our operations which will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

increased incidents of civil unrest including terrorist attacks and demonstrations that have been marked by violence have occurred in a number of countries in north africa and the middle east some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest political instability and civil unrest could continue to spread in the region and involve other areas such unrest if it continues to spread or grow in intensity could lead to civil wars regional conflicts or regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to countries in which we conduct substantial business such as in europe the us or their respective trading partners 

economic disruptions and downturns in general and particularly continued global economic uncertainty or economic turmoil in emerging markets could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

our results of operations can be materially affected by adverse conditions in the financial markets and depressed economic conditions generally economic downturns in the businesses and geographic areas in which we sell our products substantially reduce demand for our products and result in decreased sales volumes and increased credit risk recessionary environments adversely affect our business because demand for our products is reduced particularly from our customers in industrial markets generally and the automotive and housing industries specifically and may result in higher costs of capital a significant portion of our revenues and earnings are derived from our business in europe including southern europe in addition most of our european transactions and assets including cash reserves and receivables are denominated in euros 

if a sustained financial crisis in europe leads to a further significant devaluation of the euro the value of our financial assets that are denominated in euros would be significantly reduced when translated to us dollars for financial reporting purposes we also derive significant revenues from our business in emerging markets particularly the emerging markets in asia and south america any broadbased downturn in these emerging 

  

markets or in a key market such as china could require us to reduce export volumes into these markets and could also require us to divert product sales to less profitable markets any of these conditions could ultimately harm our overall business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

the cyclicality and volatility of the industries in which we participate may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 

our business operations are subject to the cyclical and volatile nature of the supplydemand balance in the chemical and refining industries our future operating results are expected to continue to be affected by this cyclicality and volatility the chemical and refining industries historically have experienced alternating periods of capacity shortages causing prices and profit margins to increase followed by periods of excess capacity resulting in oversupply declining capacity utilization rates and declining prices and profit margins 

in addition to changes in the supply and demand for products changes in energy prices and other worldwide economic conditions can cause volatility these factors result in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over business cycles 

new capacity additions in asia the middle east and north america may lead to periods of oversupply and lower profitability a sizable number of expansions have been announced in north america the timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions are uncertain and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time as a consequence we are unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of future industry cycles or their effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we sell products in highly competitive global markets and face significant price pressures 

we sell our products in highly competitive global markets due to the commodity nature of many of our products competition in these markets is based primarily on price and to a lesser extent on product performance product quality product deliverability reliability of supply and customer service often we are not able to protect our market position for these products by product differentiation and may not be able to pass on cost increases to our customers due to the significant competition in our business 

in addition we face increased competition from companies that may have greater financial resources and different cost structures or strategic goals than us these include large integrated oil companies some of which also have chemical businesses governmentowned businesses and companies that receive subsidies or other government incentives to produce certain products in a specified geographic region continuing increased competition from these companies especially in our olefin and refining businesses could limit our ability to increase product sales prices in response to raw material and other cost increases or could cause us to reduce product sales prices to compete effectively which could reduce our profitability competitors with different cost structures or strategic goals than we have may be able to invest significant capital into their businesses including expenditures for research and development 

in addition specialty products we produce may become commoditized over time increased competition could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 

interruptions of operations at our facilities may result in liabilities or lower operating results 

we own and operate largescale facilities our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our various production facilities and the ability to complete construction and maintenance projects on schedule interruptions at our facilities may materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or our business as a whole during and after the period of such operational difficulties in the past we had to shut down plants on the us gulf coast including the temporary shutdown of our houston refinery as a result of hurricanes striking the texas coast 

  

in addition because the houston refinery is our only refining operation an outage at the refinery could have a particularly negative impact on our operating results unlike our chemical and polymer production facilities which may have sufficient excess capacity to mitigate the negative impact of lost production at other facilities we do not have the ability to increase refining production elsewhere in the us 

although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions our operations are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and refining and the related storage and transportation of raw materials products and wastes these potential hazards include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or personal injury and loss of life and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date negatively impacting project returns if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering procurement and construction of facilities could materially adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors many of which are beyond our control including 

 

  

   

  

  

  

 any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects if we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs or if market conditions change it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increased it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products facilities and services 

increased global information security threats and more sophisticated targeted computer crime pose a risk to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data operations and infrastructure while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including security measures employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our employees systems networks products facilities and services remain potentially vulnerable to sophisticated espionage or cyberassault depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations 

we operate internationally and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations exchange controls political risks and other risks relating to international operations 

we operate internationally and are subject to the risks of doing business on a global level these risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates economic instability and disruptions restrictions on the transfer of funds and the imposition of duties and tariffs additional risks from our multinational business include transportation delays and interruptions war terrorist activities epidemics pandemics political instability import and export controls changes in governmental policies labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments 

we generate revenues from export sales and operations that may be denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency exchange rates between these currencies and functional currencies in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future it is possible that fluctuations in exchange rates will result in reduced operating results additionally we operate with the objective of having our worldwide cash available in the locations where it is needed including the united kingdom for our parent company’s significant cash obligations as a result of dividend and interest payments it is possible that we may not always be able to provide cash to other jurisdictions when needed or that such transfers of cash could be subject to additional taxes including withholding taxes 

our operating results could be negatively affected by the global laws rules and regulations as well as political environments in the jurisdictions in which we operate there could be reduced demand for our products decreases in the prices at which we can sell our products and disruptions of production or other operations additionally there may be substantial capital and other costs to comply with regulations andor increased security costs or insurance premiums any of which could reduce our operating results 

  

we obtain a portion of our principal raw materials from international sources that are subject to these same risks our compliance with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject could be challenged furthermore these laws may be modified the result of which may be to prevent or limit subsidiaries from transferring cash to us 

furthermore we are subject to certain existing and may be subject to possible future laws that limit or may limit our activities while some of our competitors may not be subject to such laws which may adversely affect our competitiveness 

changes in tax laws and regulations could affect our tax rate and our results of operations 

we are a tax resident in the united kingdom and are subject to the united kingdom corporate income tax system lyondellbasell nv has little or no taxable income of its own because as a holding company it does not conduct any operations through our subsidiaries we have substantial operations worldwide taxes are primarily paid on the earnings generated in various jurisdictions including the united states the netherlands germany france and italy 

a portion of the company’s interest income from internal financing is either untaxed or taxed at rates substantially lower than the us statutory rate in september 2016 the uk enacted provisions the so called “antihybrid provisions” effective for years beginning january 1 2017 that will impact our internal financing structure in addition in october 2016 the us treasury issued final section 385 debtequity regulations that may also impact our internal financings 

we monitor income tax legislative developments including for example the us tax reform proposals and the european union’s state aid investigations in countries where we conduct business recently there has been an increase in attention both in the uk and globally to the tax practices of multinational companies including proposals by the organization for economic cooperation and development with respect to base erosion and profit shifting such attention may result in legislative changes that could adversely affect our tax rate management does not believe that recent changes in income tax laws will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements although new or proposed changes to tax laws could affect our tax liabilities in the future 

many of our businesses depend on our intellectual property our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and our inability to do so could reduce our ability to maintain our competitiveness and margins 

we have a significant worldwide patent portfolio of issued and pending patents these patents and patent applications together with proprietary technical knowhow are significant to our competitive position particularly with regard to po performance chemicals petrochemicals and polymers we rely on the patent copyright and trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing however we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without authorization proceedings to protect these rights could be costly and we may not prevail 

the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes apparatuses technology trade secrets or proprietary knowhow could result in significantly lower revenues reduced profit margins and cash flows andor loss of market share we also may be subject to claims that our technology patents or other intellectual property infringes on a third party’s intellectual property rights unfavorable resolution of these claims could result in restrictions on our ability to deliver the related service or in a settlement that could be material to us 

  

shared control or lack of control of joint ventures may delay decisions or actions regarding the joint ventures 

a portion of our operations are conducted through joint ventures where control may be exercised by or shared with unaffiliated third parties we cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners including any nonperformance default or bankruptcy of joint venture partners the joint ventures that we do not control may also lack financial reporting systems to provide adequate and timely information for our reporting purposes 

our joint venture partners may have different interests or goals than we do and may take actions contrary to our requests policies or objectives differences in views among the joint venture participants also may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major matters potentially adversely affecting the business and operations of the joint ventures and in turn our business and operations we may develop a dispute with any of our partners over decisions affecting the venture that may result in litigation arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution if a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interest it could harm our brand business results of operations and financial condition 

we cannot predict with certainty the extent of future costs under environmental health and safety and other laws and regulations and cannot guarantee they will not be material 

we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture handle or own in addition because our products are components of a variety of other enduse products we along with other members of the chemical industry are subject to potential claims related to those enduse products any substantial increase in the success of these types of claims could negatively affect our operating results 

we together with the industries in which we operate are subject to extensive national regional state and local environmental laws regulations directives rules and ordinances concerning 

 

  

  

 many of these laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations in addition some of these laws and regulations require us to meet specific financial responsibility requirements any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

although we have compliance programs and other processes intended to ensure compliance with all such regulations we are subject to the risk that our compliance with such regulations could be challenged noncompliance with certain of these regulations could result in the incurrence of additional costs penalties or assessments that could be material 

our industry is subject to extensive government regulation and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures 

compliance with regulatory requirements could result in higher operating costs such as regulatory requirements relating to emissions the security of our facilities and the transportation export or registration of our products we generally expect that regulatory controls worldwide will become increasingly more demanding but cannot accurately predict future developments 

  

increasingly strict environmental laws and inspection and enforcement policies could affect the handling manufacture use emission or disposal of products other materials or hazardous and nonhazardous waste stricter environmental safety and health laws regulations and enforcement policies could result in increased operating costs or capital expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations additionally we are required to have permits for our businesses and are subject to licensing regulations these permits and licenses are subject to renewal modification and in some circumstances revocation further the permits and licenses are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

we may incur substantial costs to comply with climate change legislation and related regulatory initiatives 

there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas “ghg” reduction these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future laws in this field continue to evolve and while they are likely to be increasingly widespread and stringent at this stage it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation within the framework of the eu emissions trading scheme “ets” we were allocated certain allowances of carbon dioxide for the affected plants of our european sites for the period from 2008 to 2012 “ets ii period” the ets ii period did not bring additional cost to us as the allowance allocation was sufficient to cover the actual emissions of the affected plants we were able to build an allowance surplus during the ets ii period which has been banked to the scheme for the period from 2013 to 2020 “ets iii period” we expect to incur additional costs for the ets iii period despite the allowance surplus accrued over the ets ii period as allowance allocations have been reduced for the ets iii period and more of our plants are affected by the scheme we maintain an active hedging strategy to cover these additional costs we expect to incur additional costs in relation to future carbon or ghg emission trading schemes 

in the us the environmental protection agency the “epa” has promulgated federal ghg regulations under the clean air act affecting certain sources the epa has issued mandatory ghg reporting requirements requirements to obtain ghg permits for certain industrial plants and proposals for ghg performance standards for some facilities the recent epa action could be a precursor to further federal regulation of carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases and may affect the outcome of other climate change lawsuits pending in us courts in a manner unfavorable to our industry in any event additional regulation may be forthcoming at the us federal or state level with respect to ghg emissions and such regulation could result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances 

compliance with these or other changes in laws regulations and obligations that create a ghg emissions trading scheme or ghg reduction policies generally could significantly increase our costs or reduce demand for products we produce additionally compliance with these regulations may result in increased permitting necessary for the operation of our business or for any of our growth plans difficulties in obtaining such permits could have an adverse effect on our future growth therefore any future potential regulations and legislation could result in increased compliance costs additional operating restrictions or delays in implementing growth projects or other capital investments and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may be required to record material charges against our earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets 

we may be required to reduce production at or idle facilities for extended periods of time or exit certain businesses as a result of the cyclical nature of our industry specifically oversupplies of or lack of demand for particular products or high raw material prices may cause us to reduce production we may choose to reduce production at certain facilities because we have offtake arrangements at other facilities which make any reductions or idling unavailable at those facilities any decision to permanently close facilities or exit a business likely would result in impairment and other charges to earnings 

  

temporary outages at our facilities can last for several quarters and sometimes longer these outages could cause us to incur significant costs including the expenses of maintaining and restarting these facilities in addition even though we may reduce production at facilities we may be required to continue to purchase or pay for utilities or raw materials under takeorpay supply agreements 

our business is capital intensive and we rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and ongoing capital needs limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results 

we require significant capital to operate our current business and fund our growth strategy moreover interest payments dividends and the expansion of our business or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital we believe that our cash from operations currently will be sufficient to meet these needs however if we need external financing our access to credit markets and pricing of our capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies and the state of the capital markets generally there can be no assurances that we would be able to incur indebtedness on terms we deem acceptable and it is possible that the cost of any financings could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities which could adversely affect our operating results 

we may use our fiveyear 25 billion revolving credit facility which backs our commercial paper program to meet our cash needs to the extent available as of december 31 2016 we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the facility and 500 million outstanding under our commercial paper program leaving an unused and available credit capacity of 1973 million we may also meet our cash needs by selling receivables under our 900 million us accounts receivable securitization facility in the event of a default under our credit facility or any of our senior notes we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do any default under any of our credit arrangements could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate 

legislation and regulatory initiatives could lead to a decrease in demand for our products 

new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health safety and the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products initiatives by governments and private interest groups will potentially require increased toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us for example in the united states the national toxicology program “ntp” is a federal interagency program that seeks to identify and select for study chemicals and other substances to evaluate potential human health hazards in the european union the regulation on registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals “reach” is regulation designed to identify the intrinsic properties of chemical substances assess hazards and risks of the substances and identify and implement the risk management measures to protect humans and the environment 

assessments under ntp reach or similar programs or regulations in other jurisdictions may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals we use or produce and may result in additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of those chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

  

adverse results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us 

we are subject to and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty irrespective of its merits litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expenditure and diversion of management attention we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could materially adversely affect a portion of our business operations or materially and adversely affect our financial position and our results of operations should we fail to prevail in certain matters 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may adversely affect the valuation of pension obligations the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rates used to measure pension obligations the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets may result in corresponding increases and decreases in the value of plan assets particularly equity securities or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets any changes in key actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate or mortality rate would impact the valuation of pension obligations affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years 

nearly all of our current pension plans have projected benefit obligations that exceed the fair value of the plan assets as of december 31 2016 the aggregate deficit was 942 million any declines in the fair values of the pension plans assets could require additional payments by us in order to maintain specified funding levels 

our pension plans are subject to legislative and regulatory requirements of applicable jurisdictions which could include under certain circumstances local governmental authority to terminate the plan

 intellectual property 

we maintain an extensive patent portfolio and continue to file new patent applications in the us and other countries as of december 31 2016 we owned approximately 5300 patents and patent applications worldwide our patents and trade secrets cover our processes products and catalysts and are significant to our competitive position particularly with regard to po intermediate chemicals petrochemicals polymers and our process technologies we own globally registered and unregistered trademarks including marks for “lyondellbasell” “lyondell” and “equistar” while we believe that our intellectual property provides competitive advantages we do not regard our businesses as being materially dependent upon any single patent trade secret or trademark some of our heritage production capacity operates under licenses from third parties 

environmental 

most of our operations are affected by national state regional and local environmental laws matters pertaining to the environment are discussed in part i item 1a risk factors  part i item 3 legal proceedings  part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation s and notes 2 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

we have made and intend to continue to make the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to environmental health and safety matters we incurred capital expenditures of 192 million in 2016 for health safety and environmental compliance purposes and improvement programs and estimate such expenditures to be approximately 200 million in 2017 and 180 million in 2018 

  

while capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance including compliance with potential legislation and potential regulation related to climate change cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe they will have a material effect on our competitive position 

while there can be no assurance that physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future we do not believe these risks are material in the near term 

employee relations 

as of december 31 2016 we employed approximately 13000 fulltime and parttime employees around the world of this total 6300 were located in north america and another 5800 were located in europe the remainder of our employees is in other global locations 

as of december 31 2016 approximately 830 of our employees in north america were represented by labor unions the vast majority of our employees in europe and south america are subject to staff council or works council coverage or collective bargaining agreements

in september 2013 us environmental protection agency the “epa” region v issued a notice and finding of violation alleging violations at our morris illinois facility related to flaring activity the notice 

  

generally alleges failures to monitor steam usage and improper flare operations we reasonably believe that epa region v may assert a penalty demand in excess of 100000 

in june 2014 epa region v issued a notice and finding of violation alleging violations at our tuscola illinois facility related to flaring activity the notice generally alleges failure to conduct a valid performance test and improper flare operations we reasonably believe that epa region v may assert a penalty demand in excess of 100000 

in july 2015 the texas commission on environmental quality the “tceq” issued a proposed agreed order to houston refining lp pertaining to an emissions event which occurred in august 2014 tceq has asserted an administrative penalty demand for this matter of 100000 which was approved by the commissioners in january 2016 and has been fully paid 

in february 2016 the tceq issued a notice of enforcement to equistar chemicals lp following a tceq compliance investigation file review in april 2016 tceq issued a proposed agreed order which assesses an administrative penalty of 105000 and proposes a onetime offer to defer 21000 of the penalty if equistar satisfactorily complies with the terms of the order tceq approved the agreed order in november 2016 and the penalty has been fully paid 

in april 2016 the epa issued a notice of violation to houston refining lp arising from a 2014 inspection the epa alleged the production of fuel with excess sulfur and the failure to retire sufficient sulfur credits we have reached a final settlement which requires houston refining to pay a penalty of 434500 with no additional requirements this penalty was paid in january 2017

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend general 

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes elsewhere in this report when we use the terms “we” “us” “our” or similar words in this discussion unless the context otherwise requires we are referring to lyondellbasell industries nv and its consolidated subsidiaries 

overview 

earnings for 2016 were good despite a heavy schedule of planned maintenance and the challenges of several operational upsets at our houston refinery our continued strong earnings and cash flow enabled us to increase the amount of our interim dividends and to continue the repurchase of our ordinary shares during 2016 the global olefins and polyolefins industry benefitted from continued favorable supply and demand balances while low crude oil and fuel prices negatively impacted margins for refining and oxyfuels and related products strong results for our op—eai and technology segments demonstrate continued global industry strength 

the completion of the expansion and turnaround of our corpus christi ethylene facility in the fourth quarter of 2016 marked the final step in our 2 billion pound north american ethylene expansion program our completed ethylene expansion program the start of site preparation for our 11 billion pound polyethylene facility and advancements on the design of our new potba plant along with the completion of several major plant turnarounds this year position us favorably for the coming years 

significant items that affected 2016 results include 

 

  

  

  

 other noteworthy items during 2016 include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

   

results of operations for the periods discussed in these “results of operations” are presented in the table below 

 

 results of operations 

revenues —we had revenues of 29183 million in 2016 32735 million in 2015 and 45608 million in 2014 

2016 versus 2015— revenues decreased by 3552 million or 11 in 2016 compared to 2015 

lower average sales prices driven by decreases in the prices of crude oil and other feedstocks led to revenue declines of 10 in 2016 lower sales volumes in our refining segment due to turnaround activities and unplanned outages which were substantially offset by higher id segment sales volumes led to a 1 volumedriven decline in revenues the decline in revenues includes a 290 million impact from the sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary 

2015 versus 2014— revenues decreased 12873 million or 28 in 2015 compared to 2014 

the decline in prices for crude oil and other feedstocks during 2015 was the primary contributing factor for lower average sales prices which were responsible for 23 of the revenue decline in 2015 versus 2014 unfavorable translation impacts resulting from a significant decline in the eurous dollar exchange rate further reduced revenues by 5 during 2015 

sales volumes during 2015 were relatively unchanged from 2014 a decrease in sales due to lower crude processing rates in our refining segment was mostly offset by higher sales volumes for us and european polyolefins oxyfuels and related products and intermediate chemicals revenues for each of our business segments are reviewed further in the “segment analysis” section below 

cost of sales —cost of sales were 23191 million in 2016 25683 million in 2015 and 38939 million in 2014 

fluctuations in our cost of sales are generally driven by changes in feedstock and energy costs as all other material components remain relatively flat from year to year feedstock and energy related costs generally represent approximately 75 to 80 of cost of sales other variable costs account for approximately 10 of cost 

  

of sales on an annual basis and fixed operating costs consisting primarily of expenses associated with employee compensation depreciation and amortization and maintenance range from approximately 10 to 15 in each annual period 

2016 versus 2015— cost of sales decreased by 2492 million in 2016 compared to 2015 

the decrease in cost of sales in 2016 was primarily due to lower feedstock and energy costs raw material costs for crude oil heavy liquids and natural gas liquids “ngls” and other feedstocks were lower in 2016 compared to 2015 the sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary in 2016 also contributed approximately 230 million to the decline in 2016 cost of sales 

cost of sales in 2016 and 2015 also included noncash pretax lower of cost or market “lcm” inventory valuation charges totaling 29 million and 548 million respectively the 2016 adjustment is related to a drop in polypropylene prices in our op—americas segment and the adjustments in 2015 affected all of our segments except technology the 2015 adjustments were driven mainly by declines in the prices for crude oil ethylene propylene benzene and etbe during 2015 cost of sales also included 35 million of amortization expense associated with the expiration of emission allowance credits in our refining and id segments 

2015 versus 2014— cost of sales decreased by 13256 million in 2015 compared to 2014 

the decrease in cost of sales in 2015 was primarily due to lower feedstock and energy costs in 2015 the raw material costs for crude oil heavy liquids and natural gas liquids “ngls” and other feedstocks were significantly lower relative to 2014 

cost of sales in 2015 included the 548 million pretax lcm inventory valuation charge and 35 million of amortization expense discussed above cost of sales in 2014 included a 760 million charge related to an lcm inventory valuation adjustment driven by a decline in feedstock prices in our op—americas segment and a 52 million benefit in our op—eai segment associated with a settlement for certain existing and future environmental claims under a 2005 indemnification agreement 

operating income —our operating income was 5060 million 6122 million and 5736 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

2016 versus 2015— operating income decreased by 1062 million in 2016 

operating income for 2016 reflects the impacts of the lcm inventory valuation adjustment discussed above and a 58 million pension settlement charge operating income for 2015 reflects the lcm inventory valuation adjustment and the emission credit allowance amortization discussed above including these impacts 2016 operating income declined relative to 2015 by 863 million 243 million and 166 million in our op—americas refining and id segments respectively these lower results were partially offset by a 185 million improvement in operating income for our op—eai segment 

2015 versus 2014— operating income increased by 386 million in 2015 which includes the impact of the lcm inventory valuation adjustments environmental settlement and emission credit allowances amortization discussed above 

including these impacts operating income in 2015 for our op—eai and refining segments reflect improvements of 425 million and 250 million respectively these improvements were offset in part by a 316 million decline in the results of our op—americas segment 

operating results for each of our business segments are reviewed further in the “segment analysis” section below 

  

interest expense —interest expense was 322 million in 2016 310 million in 2015 and 352 million in 2014 

2016 versus 2015— debt issuances of our 1875 guaranteed notes due 2022 in march 2016 and our 4625 senior notes due 2055 in march 2015 and reduced benefits from our fixedforfloating interest rate swaps resulted in 42 million of higher interest expense in 2016 this increase was partially offset by a 22 million increase in capitalized interest and 7 million of lower bank and other fees 

2015 versus 2014— the decrease in interest expense in 2015 relative to 2014 was primarily due to favorable impacts of 85 million related to our fixedforfloating interest rate swaps and crosscurrency swaps this decrease was offset in part by 46 million of higher interest charges related to the issuance of our 4875 guaranteed notes due 2044 in february 2014 and our 4625 senior notes due 2055 in march 2015 

for additional information related to our fixedforfloating interest rate swaps and crosscurrency swaps see notes 12 14 and 15 

income from equity investments —our income from equity investments was 367 million in 2016 339 million in 2015 and 257 million in 2014 

2016 versus 2015— the 28 million increase in income from equity investments in 2016 is largely due to improved results for our joint ventures in mexico saudi arabia poland and thailand 

2015 versus 2014— our 2015 income from equity investments increased by 82 million over 2014 largely due to improved results from our joint ventures in poland korea and mexico offset in part by lower results from our joint ventures in saudi arabia 

income taxes— our effective income tax rates of 265 in 2016 279 in 2015 and 270 in 2014 resulted in tax provisions of 1386 million 1730 million and 1540 million respectively our 2016 income tax provision includes 135 million of noncash out of period adjustments from prior years for further information on these adjustments please see footnote 18 income taxes our effective income tax rate fluctuates based on among other factors changes in pretax income in countries with varying statutory tax rates the us domestic production activity deduction changes in valuation allowances changes in foreign exchange gainslosses the amount of exempt income and changes in unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions the company’s exempt income primarily includes interest income and equity earnings of joint ventures the interest income is earned by certain of our european subsidiaries through intercompany financings and is either untaxed or taxed at rates substantially lower than the us statutory rate the equity earnings are attributable to our joint ventures and these earnings when paid through dividends to certain european subsidiaries are eligible for participation exemptions which exempt the dividend payments from all or portions of normal statutory income tax rates we currently anticipate the favorable treatment for the interest income and dividends to continue in the near term however this treatment is based on current law and tax rulings which could change the foreign exchange gainslosses have a permanent impact on our effective income tax rate that can cause unpredictable movement in our effective income tax rate we continue to maintain valuation allowances in various jurisdictions totaling 96 million which could impact our effective tax rate in the future we believe our effective income tax rate for 2017 will be approximately 27 

2016— the 2016 effective income tax rate which was lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35 was favorably impacted by exempt income 67 earnings in various countries notably in europe with lower statutory tax rates 30 the impact of a change in nonus tax law on our deferred tax liabilities 10 and the us domestic production activity deduction 08 these favorable items were partially offset by the effects of noncash out of period adjustments 25 and us state and local income taxes 05 

  

2015— the 2015 effective income tax rate which was lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35 was favorably impacted by exempt income 51 earnings in various countries notably in europe with lower statutory tax rates 21 and the us domestic production activity deduction 14 these favorable items were partially offset by the effects of us state and local income taxes 10 

2014 —the 2014 effective income tax rate which was lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35 was favorably impacted by exempt income 48 the us domestic production activity deduction 19 foreign exchange losses 15 and earnings in various countries notably in europe with lower statutory tax rates 11 these favorable items were partially offset by the effects of us state and local income taxes 11 

for further information related to our income taxes see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

comprehensive income— we had comprehensive income of 3763 million in 2016 4064 million in 2015 and 3052 million in 2014 

2016 versus 2015— in 2016 comprehensive income decreased on lower net income the unfavorable impacts of financial derivative adjustments and the increase in actuarial losses related to our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized in 2016 these decreases were offset in part by the net favorable impact of unrealized net changes in foreign currency translation adjustments 

in 2016 we had a pretax gain of 43 million related to the effective portion of the unrealized gains of our financial instruments designated as net investment hedges the cumulative effect of our derivatives designated as cash flow hedges in 2016 was a loss of 29 million in 2016 cumulative losses associated with the strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar in the first half of the year resulted in a pretax loss of 15 million related to our cross currency swaps an unrealized loss of 17 million in 2016 related to forwardstarting interest rate swaps was driven by decreases in benchmark interest rates during that period 

a pretax loss of 63 million related to our cross currency swaps was a reclassification adjustment included in net income in 2016 

in 2016 and 2015 we recognized net actuarial losses of 188 million and 8 million respectively the 188 million net loss in 2016 reflects 279 million of losses due to pension and other postretirement benefit discount rate decreases offset by 79 million of gains related to pension asset experience and 10 million due to favorable postretirement liability experience and other immaterial items in 2015 the 8 million net loss was primarily attributable to 133 million of actual asset return less than the expected return this loss was offset by gains due to 73 million of discount rate increases and 50 million of gains due to favorable liability experience and healthcare assumptions in 2016 we also recognized a 61 million reclassification adjustment related primarily to a voluntary lump sum program offered to certain former employees in select us pension plans total lump sum payments from these plans exceeded annual service and interest cost in 2016 resulting in this loss 

2015 versus 2014— in 2015 comprehensive income increased on higher net income the reduction in actuarial losses related to our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized in 2015 the favorable impact of unrealized net changes in foreign currency translation adjustments and to a lesser extent the benefit of favorable financial derivative adjustments 

in 2015 and 2014 we recognized net actuarial losses of 8 million and 493 million respectively the 493 million net loss in the prior year was caused primarily by pension and other postretirement benefit discount rate decreases and mortality assumption changes in 2015 the 8 million net loss was primarily attributable to 133 million of actual asset return less than the expected return this loss was offset by gains due to 73 million of discount rate increases and 50 million of gains due to favorable liability experience and healthcare assumptions 

  

the predominant functional currency for our operations outside of the us is the euro relative to the us dollar the value of the euro decreased during 2015 and 2014 resulting in losses as reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income 

in 2015 the cumulative effect of our derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was a gain of 279 million cumulative gains in 2015 associated with the decline in the euro versus the us dollar resulted in a pretax gain of 262 million related to our cross currency swaps a 17 million gain in 2015 related to forwardstarting interest rate swaps were driven by increases in benchmark interest rates during that period 

a pretax loss of 207 million related to our cross currency swaps was a reclassification adjustment included in net income in 2015 

see “critical accounting policies” below and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the key assumptions included in calculating the discount rate and expected return on plan assets 

segment analysis 

we use earnings before interest income taxes and depreciation and amortization “ebitda” as our measure of profitability for segment reporting purposes this measure of segment operating results is used by our chief operating decision maker to assess the performance of and allocate resources to our operating segments intersegment eliminations and items that are not directly related or allocated to business operations are included in “other” for additional information related to our operating segments as well as a reconciliation of ebitda to its nearest generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” measure income from continuing operations before income taxes see note 22 segment and related information  to our consolidated financial statements 

  

our continuing operations are divided into five reportable segments op—americas op—eai id refining and technology the following tables reflect selected financial information for our reportable segments 

 

   

olefins and polyolefins—americas segment 

overview —in calculating the impact of margin and volume on ebitda consistent with industry practice management offsets revenues and volumes related to ethylene coproducts against the cost to produce ethylene volume and price impacts of ethylene coproducts are reported in margin ethylene is a major building block of olefins and polyolefins and as such management assesses the performance of the segment based on ethylene sales volumes and prices and our internal cost of ethylene production 

2016 versus 2015— ebitda in 2016 reflects lower olefins and polyethylene results partially offset by improved polypropylene results 

the benefit to 2016 ebitda from a 57 million gain on the sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary in february 2016 was offset in part by a 29 million noncash lcm inventory valuation charge recognized in the fourth quarter due primarily to a drop in polypropylene prices in 2015 volatility in the benchmark prices for heavy liquids and natural gas and certain correlated products particularly ethylene and propylene which continued during most of the year led to net noncash lcm inventory valuation adjustments totaling 160 million 

2015 versus 2014— segment results were lower in 2015 primarily due to a decline in olefins results partially offset by improved polyolefin results relative to 2014 olefins margins in 2015 continued to benefit from lowcost ethylene produced from ngls in north america but to a lesser extent than in 2014 the cost advantage for this ethylene compared to that produced from naphtha and other crude oilbased liquids in the rest of the world declined due to the lower crude oil prices in 2015 

prices for heavy liquids ngls and olefins declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2014 to levels that had not been seen in recent years these declines resulted in the recognition of the noncash lcm inventory adjustments totaling 279 million in 2014 discussed below as discussed above results for 2015 were also negatively impacted by a 160 million lcm inventory valuation adjustment 

ethylene raw materials —benchmark crude oil and natural gas prices generally have been indicators of the level and direction of the movement of raw material and energy costs for ethylene and its coproducts in the op—americas segment ethylene and its coproducts are produced from two major raw material groups 

 

  

 although prices of these raw materials are generally related to crude oil and natural gas prices during specific periods the relationships among these materials and benchmarks may vary significantly in the us we have significant capability to change the mix of raw materials used in the production of ethylene and its coproducts to take advantage of the relative costs of heavy liquids and ngls 

production economics for the industry have favored ngls in recent years although the decline in oil prices significantly reduced the cost of ethylene produced from heavy liquids in 2015 ngl prices also declined and they have continued to be preferred feedstocks we produced between 87 and 90 of our us ethylene production ngls during the past three years 

  

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the op—americas segment including income from equity investments which is a component of ebitda 

 

 revenues —revenues decreased by 887 million or 9 in 2016 compared to 2015 and by 3984 million or 29 in 2015 compared to 2014 

2016 versus 2015— average sales prices for ethylene and polyethylene declined in 2016 consistent with feedstock prices that are correlated to the price of natural gas which declined relative to 2015 these lower average sales prices led to a revenue decrease of 11 in that period a 2 revenue increase resulted from the improvement in 2016 product sales volumes as higher olefins sales volume supported by an increase in the level of purchases for resale during turnaround activities were only partly offset by lower polyolefins volumes the sale of our argentine subsidiary reduced 2016 revenues by 230 million 

2015 versus 2014— average sales prices declined for most products in 2015 resulting in a 31 revenue decrease compared to 2014 lower average olefin prices reflect the significant decline in prices for crude oil and correlated products relative to prices in 2014 the decline in average polyethylene and polypropylene sales prices followed the decline in the 2015 prices of their respective feedstocks ethylene and propylene 

these decreases in revenues were offset in part by an increase in sales volumes which gave rise to a 2 revenue increase in 2015 compared to 2014 ethylene sales volumes were higher due to increased production reflecting higher capacity following the completion of the expansionrelated turnaround at our la porte texas facility during 2014 and additional production related to less planned and unplanned downtime at our channelview texas facility polyethylene sales volumes improved in 2015 due to the completion of an expansionrelated turnaround at our matagorda texas facility in the first quarter of 2014 and continued healthy global demand 

ebitda —ebitda decreased by 784 million or 21 in 2016 compared to 2015 and by 250 million or 6 in 2015 compared to 2014 

2016 versus 2015— lower olefin and polyethylene margins in 2016 were partially offset by higher polypropylene margins the decline in olefins margins reflected a 2 cents per pound decrease in average ethylene sales prices and an approximate 4 cents per pound increase in the cost of ethylene production driven by lower coproduct prices and an increase in the cost of ngl feedstocks polyethylene margins declined 4 cents per pound from very high levels in 2015 as average polyethylene sales prices caught up with the overall decline in the cost of ethylene feedstock after lagging feedstock cost declines in 2015 a 4 cent per pound improvement in 2016 polypropylene margins reflects the benefits of lower propylene feedstock costs and tight market conditions these olefin and polyethylene margin impacts led to a 17 decrease in ebitda during 2016 an additional 10 decline in 2016 ebitda is attributed to the impact of lower volumes related to lower ethylene production during the turnaround and expansionrelated activities at our corpus christi texas ethylene facility and a sitewide outage related to turnaround activities at our morris illinois site 

these negative impacts were partially offset by a 6 increase in 2016 ebitda primarily due to a 131 million reduction in the unfavorable lcm adjustment recognized in 2016 versus 2015 and to the 57 million gain on the 2016 sale of our argentine subsidiary 

2015 versus 2014— the 6 decrease in ebitda reflected a 24 net margin decline as lower olefin margins were partly offset by higher polyethylene and polypropylene margins this decrease in margins was 

  

offset in part by a 14 increase related to higher volumes and a 3 increase related to the 119 million decline in the noncash charges related to the lcm inventory valuation adjustments discussed above improvements in our income from equity investments accounts for the remaining 1 increase in ebitda during 2015 

olefin margins declined in 2015 as a 19 cent per pound drop in the average sales price for ethylene outpaced the decrease in our cost of ethylene production lower ngl and heavy liquids feedstock prices in 2015 outpaced the decline in selling prices of our coproducts which resulted in the decrease of our cost of ethylene production compared to the prior year 

polyethylene margins reflected a 5 cent per pound improvement in 2015 as demand remained strong and decreases in the cost of ethylene feedstock outpaced lower average sales prices relative to 2014 polypropylene margins which increased by 7 cents per pound in 2015 benefited from lower propylene feedstock costs which in part reflected the decline in crude oil prices and higher average sales prices relative to propylene driven by industry operating issues and increased demand 

sales volumes in 2015 increased as compared to the prior year as a result of downtime and expansionrelated activities in 2014 and the increased demand discussed above 

olefins and polyolefins—europe asia international segment 

overview — in calculating the impact of margin and volume on ebitda consistent with industry practice management offsets revenues and volumes related to ethylene coproducts against the cost to produce ethylene volume and price impacts of ethylene coproducts are reported in margin ethylene is a major building block of our olefins and polyolefins and as such management assesses the performance of the segment based on ethylene sales volumes and prices and our internal cost of ethylene production 

2016 versus 2015 — higher operating results in 2016 were largely the result of higher polyolefin margins offset in part by lower olefins results and reductions in polyolefins volumes due to turnaround activity and unplanned downtime 

ebitda in 2016 reflects the benefit of a 21 million gain from the sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary and 11 million of gains from the sales of our joint venture in japan and idled assets in australia ebitda in 2015 included a 30 million noncash lcm inventory valuation adjustment driven by a decline in the prices of naphtha and polyolefins 

2015 versus 2014— operating results in 2015 reflect improved results for our european polyolefins and to a lesser extent higher results for olefins and better results for our joint ventures that are accounted for using the equity method 

at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 lower feedstock and product prices resulted in market prices that were lower than the carrying value of our related inventories accordingly we recorded a 30 million noncash lcm inventory valuation charge related to olefins and polyolefins this compares to the 44 million noncash lcm inventory valuation charge related to olefins that was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of the declining price of naphtha 

ethylene raw materials —in europe heavy liquids are the primary raw materials for our ethylene production in recent years we have sourced increased amounts of advantaged ngls when the opportunity has arisen in 2016 we continued to process advantaged feedstocks as market opportunities allowed 

  

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the op—eai segment including income from equity investments which is a component of ebitda 

 

 revenues —revenues in 2016 decreased by 997 million or 9 compared to 2015 and by 3627 million or 24 in 2015 compared to 2014 

2016 versus 2015— the decline in 2016 revenues comprises a 7 decrease related to lower average sales prices and a 2 reduction of sales volumes stemming from turnaround activities and unplanned outages 

in 2016 average sales prices for olefins and polyolefins fell following feedstock prices that declined in conjunction with the price of crude oil 

2015 versus 2014— the decline in 2015 revenues reflects decreases of 14 and 12 related to lower average sales prices and currency translation impacts respectively an increase in polyolefins volumes resulting from increased demand and higher operating rates which was substantially offset by a decline in olefins volumes stemming from turnaround activities at our münchsmünster germany facility and unplanned outages was responsible for a 2 revenue increase in 2015 

in 2015 lower average sales prices for polypropylene were partially offset by higher average polyethylene prices decreases in feedstock costs in 2015 led to the decline in polypropylene sales prices compared to 2014 the increase in polyethylene prices in 2015 reflect strong spread increases over ethylene primarily in europe 

ebitda —ebitda increased by 242 million or 13 in 2016 compared to 2015 and by 459 million or 34 in 2015 compared to 2014 

2016 versus 2015 —in 2016 higher european polyolefins margins stemming from declining ethylene and propylene feedstock costs outpaced falling product prices and led to an 11 increase in ebitda this margin improvement in 2016 was partially offset by a 2 decrease in ebitda due largely to lower polyolefin volumes 

a 3 increase in 2016 ebitda is attributed to gains associated with the sales of a joint venture idled assets and our wholly owned argentine subsidiary as well as the absence of the 2015 lcm inventory valuation adjustment discussed above income from our equity investments also led to a 1 increase in ebitda in 2016 due to higher polyolefin margins in our european joint venture and strong operating rates in our saudi joint ventures 

2015 versus 2014— improved margins in all major product groups and the increase in polyolefins volumes described above contributed 42 and 4 respectively to ebitda in 2015 polyolefins margins improved due to supply constraints as a result of several industry outages olefins margins improved in 2015 as the lower cost of ethylene production which was driven by lower feedstock prices outpaced the decline in olefin product prices 

a 4 increase in ebitda associated with an improvement in income from equity investments in 2015 was mainly driven by improved margins relative to 2014 in certain joint ventures as a result of favorable market prices during 2015 and strong operating rates 

these increases were partially offset by a 13 decrease due to the translation of a weaker euro and a 3 decrease related to a net charge of 38 million discussed below in 2015 ebitda included a 30 million charge related to the lcm adjustment previously discussed in 2014 ebitda included a 52 million benefit associated 

  

with a settlement for certain existing and future environmental claims under a 2005 indemnification agreement from an insurance settlement which was offset in part by the 44 million lcm inventory valuation charge discussed above 

intermediates and derivatives segment 

overview 

2016 versus 2015— operating results for 2016 were lower than in 2015 as margin compression for most products related to declining energy prices higher industry production rates and additional industry capacity was only partly offset by the impact of higher volumes 

ebitda in 2015 was negatively impacted by the recognition of 181 million of lcm inventory valuation adjustments driven by the continued decline in prices for feedstocks certain oxyfuels and related products and intermediate chemical products to levels that were lower than the carrying value of our related inventories at reporting dates throughout the year 

2015 versus 2014 —results in 2015 improved as higher margins in intermediate chemicals benefited from the favorable impact of product pricing and declining feedstock costs this improvement was substantially offset by a decline in 2015 oxyfuels and related products results indicative of a decrease in energy prices compared to unusually high margins in 2014 

our 2015 results were also unfavorably impacted by the noncash lcm inventory valuation adjustment discussed above which reflects an 88 million increase over the lcm inventory valuation adjustment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the id segment including income from equity investments which is a component of ebitda 

 

 revenues —revenues for 2016 decreased by 546 million or 7 compared to 2015 and by 2358 million or 23 in 2015 compared to 2014 

2016 versus 2015— lower average sales prices in 2016 reflect the impacts of lower crude oil lower gasoline prices and the decline in various feedstock prices additional industry supply also negatively impacted the average sales prices for certain products during 2016 these lower sales prices in 2016 were responsible for an 11 revenue decrease 

this price driven decrease was offset in part by a 4 volumerelated revenue increase in 2016 resulting from fewer planned and unplanned production outages relative to 2015 

2015 versus 2014— in 2015 the significant decline in crude oil and key feedstocks prices was the primary driver behind the overall decrease in average sales prices across most products this decline in prices was offset in part by improved octane blend premiums for oxyfuels and related products and gasoline price spreads over crude oil that were strong in 2015 these lower average sales prices and the impact of currency translation impacts led to revenue decreases of 23 and 6 respectively 

  

higher sales volumes for oxyfuels and related products and intermediate chemicals were largely responsible for a 6 volume driven revenue increase sales volumes for oxyfuels and related products increased due to strong octane and gasoline demand intermediate chemicals volumes increased due to increased feedstock supply and improved operating rates at our acetyls facilities 

ebitda —ebitda decreased by 142 million or 10 in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased by 16 million or 1 in 2015 compared to 2014 

2016 versus 2015— lower margins in most id products in 2016 resulted in a 30 decrease in ebitda weaker gasoline markets drove oxyfuels and related product values lower relative to butane feedstock costs and lower product prices in propylene oxide and derivatives and intermediate chemicals were driven largely by increased industry supply lower income from our equity investments in 2016 also resulted in a 1 decrease in ebitda during that period 

an ebitda increase in 2016 of 9 related to the higher volumes discussed above partially offset the negative margin impact ebitda in 2016 also reflected an increase of 12 related to the absence of the lcm inventory valuation adjustment recognized in the 2015 comparison period 

2015 versus 2014— ebitda increased by 16 million or 1 in 2015 compared to 2014 higher sales volumes in 2015 as discussed above led to a volumedriven increase of 7 in ebitda 

lower oxyfuels and related products margins substantially offset by an improvement in intermediate chemicals margins resulted in a 1 decrease in 2015 ebitda oxyfuels and related products margins were lower in 2015 due to a significant decline in crude oil prices offset in part by strong gasoline price spreads over crude oil and octane blending value margins for intermediate chemicals improved as styrene margins were favorably impacted by tight supply resulting from industry outages and feedstock prices that declined more rapidly than average sales prices 

ebitda was further reduced by 6 as a result of the 88 million incremental increase in the noncash lcm inventory valuation adjustment recognized in 2015 over 2014 the remaining change in 2015 ebitda is attributable to a small improvement in income from our equity investments 

refining segment 

overview 

2016 versus 2015— lower margins and reduced production due to planned and unplanned outages in 2016 as described below resulted in significantly lower results for our refining segment in 2016 as compared to 2015 ebitda in 2015 included charges totaling 177 million related to noncash charges associated with lcm inventory valuation adjustments driven by a decline of nearly 20 per barrel in crude oil prices and corresponding reductions in refined product prices 

2015 versus 2014— the results of our refining segment in 2015 were impacted by noncash charges totaling 177 million related to lcm inventory valuation adjustments described above which were 167 million less than the lcm inventory valuation adjustment recorded in 2014 

fourth quarter 2015 results declined significantly compared to the results in the prior three quarters of 2015 as refinery operating rates were significantly lower due to unplanned maintenance outages the recognition of a 127 million noncash lcm inventory valuation adjustment resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter operating results were higher in 2015 relative to 2014 as a result of improvements in refining margins and the favorable impact of the lower lcm adjustment recognized in 2015 

  

the following table sets forth selected financial information and heavy crude processing rates for the refining segment and the us refining market margins for the applicable periods “lls” is a light crude oil while “maya” is a heavy crude oil 

 

 revenues —revenues decreased by 1422 million or 22 in 2016 compared to 2015 and by 5153 million or 44 in 2015 compared to 2014 

2016 versus 2015— major refined product prices declined due to lower crude oil prices and to weakness relative to crude oil the average per barrel price of benchmark maya crude oil declined 759 in 2016 compared to 2015 a 16 pricerelated revenue decline in 2016 versus 2015 reflected per barrel price declines of approximately 1051 and 1077 for gasoline and distillates respectively 

the remaining 6 revenue decrease in 2016 is attributed to reduced processing rates processing declines resulted from several unplanned outages including a coker unit fire downtime at crude units with reduced processing and several utility interruptions planned turnaround activity on a crude unit and a coker unit processing train early in 2016 also contributed to lower throughput during 2016 

2015 versus 2014— total revenues decreased on significantly lower product prices due to the drop in crude oil prices and a reduction in sales volumes due to production limitations the average crude oil price in 2015 declined by slightly over 40 per barrel compared to 2014 leading to lower product pricing this decline in product pricing caused a 38 decrease in revenues compared to 2014 processing rates in 2015 reflect an 8 decrease from 2014 rates driven by processing limits which were negatively impacted primarily by unplanned maintenance in the fourth quarter of 2015 this decline contributed to a 6 decrease in 2015 revenues 

ebitda —ebitda decreased by 270 million or 79 in 2016 compared to 2015 and decreased by 277 million or 426 in 2015 compared to 2014 

2016 versus 2015— a decline in refining margins in 2016 led to a 90 decrease in ebitda the maya 211 benchmark refining spread declined in 2016 by approximately 310 per barrel relative to 2015 this decrease was driven by per barrel declines of approximately 315 and 340 in gasoline and diesel spreads respectively and an approximate 100 reduction in the price differential between brent and maya crude oils the operating issues that drove lower crude throughput in 2016 also negatively impacted margins due to a less favorably priced crude oil mix and higher variable costs per barrel 

lower production stemming from a reduction in average heavy crude oil processing rates relative to 2015 led to a decrease in ebitda in 2016 of 41 this reduction in rates was attributable to the unplanned outages crude unit operating limitations and planned turnaround activities discussed above 

  

the absence of the 177 million lcm inventory valuation adjustment recognized in 2015 resulted in an ebitda increase of 52 in 2016 as compared to 2015 

2015 versus 2014— lcm inventory valuation adjustments of 177 million and 344 million were recognized in 2015 and 2014 respectively this change in the 2015 lcm inventory valuation adjustment resulted in a 257 increase in ebitda results improved by an additional 283 in 2015 due to an increase in refining margins these improvements were offset in part by a 114 decline in ebitda due to lower processing rates 

the increase in refining margins in 2015 relative to 2014 was generated by improved byproduct price spreads to crude oil and a 14 increase in purchases of crude oil at advantaged prices relative to the maya crude price benchmark byproduct spreads improved due to the decline in 2015 of the average per barrel price of crude oil relative to 2014 these factors more than offset the 213 per barrel decline in the maya 211 benchmark margin in 2015 versus 2014 

crude processing rates in 2015 reflect an 8 decline relative to 2014 this decline is mainly due to a number of unplanned outages for maintenance that began in the latter part of the third quarter and extended into early december the average crude processing rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 206 thousands of barrels per day processing rates returned to near full capacity by middecember 2015 

technology segment 

overview —the technology segment recognizes revenues related to the sale of polyolefin catalysts and the licensing of chemical and polyolefin process technologies these revenues are offset in part by the costs incurred in the production of catalysts licensing and services activities and research and development “rd” activities in 2016 and 2015 our technology segment incurred approximately 55 of all rd costs while in 2014 it incurred approximately 65 of our rd costs 

2016 versus 2015— ebitda in 2016 improved with higher catalyst margins a small increase in licensing and services revenue was mostly offset by slightly lower catalyst sales volumes 

2015 versus 2014— ebitda in 2015 was relatively unchanged compared to 2014 reflecting improved catalyst results and lower rd expenses offset by lower licensing and services revenues 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the technology segment 

 

 revenues —revenues increased by 14 million or 3 in 2016 compared to 2015 and decreased by 32 million or 6 in 2015 compared to 2014 

2016 versus 2015— higher average catalyst sales prices and higher revenues recognized on process licenses each led to a 2 increase in 2016 revenues these increases were partly offset by a 1 revenue decrease resulting from lower catalyst sales volumes 

2015 versus 2014— the unfavorable currency translation impacts due to the significantly weaker euro versus the us dollar and a decline in licensing and services revenues contributed 12 and 7 to the decrease in 2015 revenues these declines were offset in part by revenue increases of 12 and 1 respectively related to higher catalyst sales volumes and higher average catalyst sales prices in 2015 

  

ebitda —ebitda in 2016 increased by 19 million or 8 compared to 2015 and by 11 million or 5 in 2015 compared to 2014 

2016 versus 2015— a 10 improvement in ebitda during 2016 due to higher catalyst margins and an increase in licensing and services revenue was partly offset by a 2 decrease in ebitda resulting from lower catalyst volumes 

2015 versus 2014— ebitda increased by 11 million or 5 in 2015 compared to 2014 improved catalyst volumes and margins partly offset by unfavorable currency translation impacts and lower r d expenses were responsible for increases in ebitda of 7 and 9 respectively these increases were partly offset by an 11 decrease in ebitda due to lower licensing and services revenues 

financial condition 

operating investing and financing activities of continuing operations which are discussed below are presented in the following table 

 

 operating activities —cash of 5606 million generated in 2016 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items and cash generated by the main components of working capital—accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable the noncash items in 2016 included a 78 million gain related to the sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary with adjustments for related working capital and gains totaling 11 million related to sales of our joint venture in japan and idled assets in australia 

the main components of working capital generated cash of 123 million in 2016 higher product sales prices in the fourth quarter of 2016 across all segments combined with the impact of higher fourth quarter 2016 sales volumes in our op—americas refining and id segments led to an increase in accounts receivable this increase in accounts receivable was offset by higher accounts payable which was driven by the higher cost of crude oil and other feedstocks the level of inventories fell in our op—americas segment following the completion of turnaround activities in the fourth quarter of 2016 and in our refining segment which had higher crude oil inventories at the end of 2015 due to operational issues during the fourth quarter 

cash of 5842 million generated in 2015 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items and cash used by the main components of working capital the main components of working capital consumed cash of 246 million in 2015 the lower cost of crude oil and other feedstocks in 2015 led to a decline in accounts payable preparation for the turnaround in 2016 at our corpus christi texas facility and the unplanned maintenance outage at our houston refinery which resulted in higher levels of us olefins and crude oil inventories at year end led to the increase in consolidated inventories in 2015 accounts receivable decreased on lower average product sales prices reflective of the drop in 2015 crude oil prices 

cash of 6048 million generated in 2014 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items and refunds totaling 232 million for value added taxes related to prior periods that were received from italian tax authorities in 2014 these cash inflows were offset in part by cash used by the main components of working capital 

  

the increase in 2014 inventories primarily reflected higher olefins raw material inventories offset in part by lower ethylene and propylene inventories due to turnaround activities at our la porte texas facility and higher levels of inventory for crude oil and workinprocess in our refining segment lower feedstock costs led to the decrease in 2014 accounts payable the decrease in accounts receivable primarily reflected lower ethylene prices in our op—eai segment lower prices for oxyfuels and related products in our id segment lower average sales prices and year end volumes in north american polyolefins and lower prices for refining products also contributing to the decline was a larger than usual accounts receivable balance at the end of 2013 attributable to customer remittance timing 

investing activities —we invested cash of 2297 million 1051 million and 3531 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

we invest in investmentgrade and other highquality instruments that provide adequate flexibility to redeploy funds as needed to meet our cash flow requirements while maximizing yield in 2016 2015 and 2014 we invested 764 million 2073 million and 3439 million respectively in securities that are classified as shortterm investments the majority of these investments are deemed availableforsale however beginning in the third quarter of 2016 we invested in additional securities deemed heldtomaturity we also invested 674 million 397 million and 425 million in triparty repurchase agreements in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively these investments are classified as shortterm loans receivable except for a 101 million investment which was classified as a longterm loan receivable in 2015 we received proceeds upon the sale and maturity of certain of our availableforsale securities and repurchase agreements of 674 million and 685 million respectively in 2016 2489 million and 350 million respectively in 2015 and 1751 million and 75 million respectively in 2014 see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these investments 

the following table summarizes our capital expenditures for continuing operations for the periods from 2014 through 2016 

 

 in 2017 we expect to spend approximately 2 billion which includes contributions to our po joint venture assets capital spending is projected to be lower in 2017 relative to 2016 which included the ethylene expansion and related turnaround of our corpus christi texas facility and turnaround activities at other facilities 

in 2016 and 2015 capital expenditures included debottlenecks of certain assets to enhance production turnaround activities and expansion projects at several sites as well as other plant improvement projects and railcar purchases the increased levels of capital expenditures in 2016 versus 2015 for our op—americas op—eai and refining segments were largely due to debottleneck and turnaround activities 

financing activities —financing activities used cash of 3349 million 4850 million and 5907 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

  

we made payments totaling 2938 million 4656 million and 5788 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively to acquire a portion of our outstanding ordinary shares we also made dividend payments totaling 1395 million 1410 million and 1403 million to our shareholders in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively for additional information related to these share repurchases and dividend payments see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements

see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our credit facilities and notes discussed above including terms of redemption 

in may 2016 our shareholders approved a proposal to authorize us to repurchase up to an additional 10 or approximately 425 million of our shares outstanding over the following eighteen months our share repurchase program does not have a stated dollar amount and purchases may be made through open market purchases private market transactions or other structured transactions repurchased shares could be retired or used for general corporate purposes including for various employee benefit and compensation plans as of december 31 2016 we have purchased 213 million shares under this program for approximately 1688 million as of february 14 2017 we had approximately 20 million shares remaining under the current authorization the timing and amount of additional shares repurchased will be determined by our management board based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors for additional information related to our share repurchase programs see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

in september 2016 we received proceeds of 72 million from the sale of our joint venture in japan we also purchased a net additional 741 interest in our joint venture in korea for 36 million in september 2016 in february 2016 we received net proceeds of 137 million from the sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary 

we engaged an investment bank in 2016 to assist in testing the value of our houston refinery as part of our regular review of our asset portfolio and as a result of indications of interest in the refinery by third parties following a thorough process we have elected to retain the refinery in our asset portfolio 

we may repay or redeem our debt including purchases of our outstanding bonds in the open market using cash on hand cash from operating activities proceeds from the issuance of debt proceeds from asset divestitures or a combination thereof in connection with any repayment or redemption of our debt we may incur cash and noncash charges which could be material in the period in which they are incurred we currently intend to refinance certain outstanding debt subject to market conditions in the first quarter of 2017 our current analyses indicate that the refinancing may result in charges of approximately 125 million based on current market conditions the actual costs will depend on several factors including interest rates and market conditions if and when the refinancing occurs 

we plan to fund our ongoing working capital capital expenditures debt service and other funding requirements with cash from operations which could be affected by general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory business and other factors many of which are beyond our control cash on hand cash from operating activities proceeds from the issuance of debt or a combination thereof may be used to fund the repurchase of shares under our share repurchase program 

we intend to continue to declare and pay quarterly dividends with the goal of increasing the dividend over time after giving consideration to our cash balances and expected results from operations 

we believe that our cash on hand cash from operating activities and proceeds from our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due 

contractual and other obligations —the following table summarizes as of december 31 2016 our minimum payments for longterm debt including current maturities shortterm debt and contractual and other obligations for the next five years and thereafter 

 

   

total debt —our debt includes unsecured senior notes guaranteed notes and various other us and nonus loans see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of covenant requirements under the credit facilities and indentures and additional information regarding our debt facilities 

interest on total debt —our debt and related party debt agreements contain provisions for the payment of monthly quarterly or semiannual interest at a stated rate of interest over the term of the debt 

pension and other postretirement benefits —we maintain several defined benefit pension plans as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements many of our us and nonus plans are subject to minimum funding requirements however the amounts of required future contributions for all our plans are not fixed and can vary significantly due to changes in economic assumptions liability experience and investment return on plan assets as a result we have excluded pension and other postretirement benefit obligations from the contractual and other obligations table above our annual contributions may include amounts in excess of minimum required funding levels contributions to our nonus plans in years beyond 2017 are not expected to be materially different than the expected 2017 contributions disclosed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2016 the projected benefit obligation for our pension plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by 942 million subject to future actuarial gains and losses as well as future asset earnings we together with our consolidated subsidiaries will be required to fund the discounted obligation of 942 million in future years we contributed 114 million 107 million and 94 million to our pension plans in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively we provide other postretirement benefits primarily medical benefits to eligible participants as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements we pay other unfunded postretirement benefits as incurred 

advances from customers —we are obligated to deliver products in connection with longterm sales agreements under which advances from customers were received in prior years these advances are treated as deferred revenue and will be amortized to earnings as product is delivered over the remaining terms of the respective contracts which range predominantly from 2 to 8 years the unamortized longterm portion of such advances totaled 47 million as of december 31 2016 

other —other primarily consists of accruals for environmental remediation costs obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and anticipated asset retirement obligations see “critical accounting policies” below for a discussion of obligations for environmental remediation costs 

deferred income taxes —the scheduled settlement of the deferred tax liabilities shown in the table is based on the scheduled reversal of the underlying temporary differences actual cash tax payments will vary depending upon future taxable income see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our deferred tax liabilities 

purchase obligations —we are party to various obligations to purchase products and services principally for raw materials utilities and industrial gases these commitments are designed to assure sources of supply and are not expected to be in excess of normal requirements the commitments are segregated into takeorpay contracts and other contracts under the takeorpay contracts we are obligated to make minimum payments whether or not we take the product or service other contracts include contracts that specify minimum quantities however in the event that we do not take the contractual minimum we are only obligated for any resulting economic loss suffered by the vendor the payments shown for the other contracts assume that minimum quantities are purchased for contracts with variable pricing terms the minimum payments reflect the contract price at december 31 2016 

operating leases —we lease various facilities and equipment under noncancelable lease arrangements for various periods see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for related lease disclosures 

  

current business outlook 

in the past several months the industry outlook for 2017 has steadily improved healthy us and global economic activity and ethylene project delays have led to an improved forecast for industry supply and demand dynamics crude oil prices and ngl supply have stabilized at more favorable levels than during much of 2016 the us regulatory landscape may change in ways that are generally favorable to our industry while we will continue to watch these developments we believe our significant investment in our 2016 maintenance programs favorably positions us for 2017 

related party transactions 

we have related party transactions with our joint venture partners we believe that such transactions are effected on terms substantially no more or less favorable than those that would have been agreed upon by unrelated parties on an arm’s length basis see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional related party disclosures 

critical accounting policies 

management applies those accounting policies that it believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the us see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements our more critical accounting policies include those related to the valuation of inventory longlived assets the valuation of goodwill accruals for longterm employee benefit costs such as pension and other postretirement costs and accruals for taxes based on income inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management management periodically updates its estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment 

inventory —we account for our inventory using the lastin firstout “lifo” method of accounting 

the cost of raw materials which represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses and energy costs generally follow price trends for crude oil andor natural gas crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to many factors including changes in economic conditions 

since our inventory consists of manufactured products derived from crude oil natural gas natural gas liquids and correlated materials as well as the associated feedstocks and intermediate chemicals our inventory market values are generally influenced by changes in benchmark crude oil and heavy liquid values and prices for manufactured finished goods the degree of influence of a particular benchmark may vary from period to period as the composition of the dollar value lifo pools change due to natural inventory composition changes variation in pricing from period to period does not necessarily result in a linear lcm impact additionally an lcm condition may arise due to a volumetric decline in a particular material that had previously provided a positive impact within a pool as a result market valuations and lcm conditions are dependent upon the composition and mix of materials on hand at the balance sheet date in the measurement of an lcm adjustment the numeric input value for determining the crude oil market price includes pricing that is weighted by volume of inventories held at a point in time including wti brent and maya crude oils 

as indicated above fluctuation in the prices of crude oil natural gas and correlated products from period to period may result in the recognition of charges to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in periods of falling prices and the reversal of those charges in subsequent interim periods as market prices recover accordingly our cost of sales and results of operations may be affected by such fluctuations 

  

on may 1 2010 upon emergence from bankruptcy we recorded our inventory which is primarily crude oil and correlated products derived therefrom at fair value in accordance with the requirements of freshstart accounting the per barrel benchmark price of wti crude oil at that date was 8615 

during 2014 we recorded lcm inventory valuation adjustments totaling 760 million driven primarily by the decline in the price of crude oil and related declines in the prices of heavy liquids and other correlated products a 45 million charge was taken in the third quarter of 2014 which marked the beginning of a downward price trend an additional 715 million of lcm inventory valuation adjustment was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 to reflect decreases of approximately 50 in the price indices for crude oil and other correlated products as compared to the third quarter of 2014 at december 31 2014 representative prices for crude oil and heavy liquids were 4759 per barrel and 4520 per barrel respectively these price inputs were calculated using a weighted average of the materials held in inventory on that date 

the trend of falling hydrocarbon prices continued in 2015 leading to further lcm inventory valuation adjustments in 2015 the cumulative charge related to lcm inventory valuation adjustments which was driven by declines in crude oil ethylene propylene benzene and etbe was 548 million representative prices used in the calculation of the cumulative lcm inventory adjustments recognized in 2015 were 3022 per barrel for crude oil 20 cents per pound for ethylene 32 cents per pound for propylene 214 per gallon for benzene and 166 per gallon for etbe 

a drop in polypropylene prices led to the recognition of a 29 million lcm adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2016 

further sustained price declines in our finished goods and raw materials could result in additional lcm inventory valuation charges during 2017 several of our lifo inventory pools are “atrisk” for further adjustment as each impacted lifo pool is at or close to the calculated market value at the last balance sheet measurement date “atrisk” inventory accounts for 22 billion of our total inventory carrying value of 38 billion as of december 31 2016 the extent to which further adjustment may occur is dependent on pool specific product prices and composition within each individual dollar value lifo pool at the balance sheet date 

longlived assets —with respect to longlived assets which primarily include property plant and equipment and intangible assets key assumptions included estimates of useful lives and the recoverability of carrying values of fixed assets and other intangible assets as well as the existence of any obligations associated with the retirement of fixed assets such estimates could be significantly modified andor the carrying values of the assets could be impaired by such factors as new technological developments new chemical industry entrants with significant raw material or other cost advantages uncertainties associated with the european us and other world economies the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries and uncertainties associated with regulatory governmental actions 

when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we evaluate definite lived intangible assets for impairment longlived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets which for us is generally at the plant group level or at times individual plants in certain circumstances where we have isolated production units with separately identifiable cash flows when it is probable that the undiscounted cash flows of a tangible asset or asset group will not be sufficient to recover the carrying amount the asset is written down to its estimated fair value inprocess research and development projects are impaired when abandoned 

the estimated useful lives of longlived assets range from 3 to 30 years depreciation and amortization of these assets including amortization of capitalized plant turnaround costs under the straightline method over their estimated useful lives totaled 1064 million in 2016 the useful lives of assets are assessed periodically and if determined to be shorter than originally estimated depreciation and amortization charges would be accelerated over the revised useful life 

  

goodwill —goodwill of 528 million at december 31 2016 represents the tax effect of the differences between the tax and book bases of our assets and liabilities resulting from the revaluation of those assets and liabilities to fair value in connection with the company’s emergence from bankruptcy and adoption of freshstart accounting we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill of a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable 

we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors assessed for each of the reporting units include but are not limited to changes in longterm commodity prices discount rates competitive environments planned capacity cost factors such as raw material prices and financial performance of the reporting units if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a twostep quantitative test is required 

we also have the option to proceed directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test under the twostep impairment test the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill for step one of the impairment test the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated using a discounted cashflow model such a model inherently utilizes a significant number of estimates and assumptions including operating margins tax rates discount rates capital expenditures and working capital changes step two of the impairment test would be performed should management conclude that the carrying value of a reporting unit including goodwill is in excess of its fair value in step two of the impairment test the carrying amount of a reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of its goodwill valuation experts may be used in such an assessment if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment charge equal to the excess would be recognized 

for 2016 and 2015 management performed a qualitative impairment assessment of our reporting units which indicated that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their carrying value accordingly a quantitative twostep goodwill impairment test was not required accordingly no goodwill impairment was recognized in 2016 or 2015 

longterm employee benefit costs —our costs for longterm employee benefits particularly pension and other postretirement medical and life insurance benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is management’s responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent its best estimates of the future effects of those uncertainties it also is management’s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 

the current benefit service costs as well as the existing liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis the discount rate is a current rate related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled our assumed discount rate is based on yield information for highquality corporate bonds with durations comparable to the expected cash settlement of our obligations for the purpose of measuring the benefit obligations at december 31 2016 we used a weighted average discount rate of 420 for the us plans which reflects the different terms of the related benefit obligations the weighted average discount rate used to measure obligations for nonus plans at december 31 2016 was 152 reflecting market interest rates the discount rates in effect at december 31 2016 will be used to measure net periodic benefit cost during 2017 

the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of other postretirement medical benefits are also measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits as of december 31 2016 the assumed rate of increase for our us plans was 70 decreasing to 45 in 2038 and 

  

thereafter a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate assumption as of december 31 2016 would have resulted in a 21 million increase or 14 million decrease in the accumulated other postretirement benefit liability for our nonus plans and would have resulted in an increase or decrease of less than 1 million for us plans due to limits on our maximum contribution level under the medical plan there would have been no significant effect on either our benefit liability or net periodic cost 

the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption investment returns that are recognized currently in net income represent the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets applied to a marketrelated value of plan assets which for us is defined as the market value of assets the expected rate of return on plan assets is a longer term rate and is expected to change less frequently than the current assumed discount rate reflecting longterm market expectations rather than current fluctuations in market conditions 

the weighted average expected longterm rate of return on assets in our us plans of 800 is based on the average level of earnings that our independent pension investment advisor had advised could be expected to be earned over time and 337 for our nonus plan assets is based on an expectation and asset allocation that varies by region the asset allocations are summarized in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements the actual returns in 2016 were gains of 722 and 1581 for our us and nonus plan assets respectively 

the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets management’s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 

net periodic pension cost recognized each year includes the expected asset earnings rather than the actual earnings or loss along with other gains and losses this unrecognized amount to the extent it cumulatively exceeds 10 of the projected benefit obligation for the respective plan is recognized as additional net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service period of the participants in each plan 

the following table reflects the sensitivity of the benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans to changes in the actuarial assumptions 

 

   

the sensitivity of our postretirement benefit plans obligations and net periodic benefit costs to changes in actuarial assumptions are reflected in the following table 

 

 additional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

accruals for taxes based on income —the determination of our provision for income taxes and the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities is subject to management’s estimates and judgments due to the complexity of the tax laws and regulations in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of these complex laws and regulations 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 

we recognize future tax benefits to the extent that the realization of these benefits is more likely than not our current provision for income taxes is impacted by the recognition and release of valuation allowances related to net deferred assets in certain nonus jurisdictions further changes to these valuation allowances may impact our future provision for income taxes which will include no tax benefit with respect to losses incurred and no tax expense with respect to income generated in these countries until the respective valuation allowance is eliminated 

we recognize the financial statement benefits with respect to an uncertain income tax position that we have taken or may take on an income tax return when we believe it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities for a position that is likely to be sustained the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest cumulative amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of lyondellbasell industries nv’s management of commodity price risk foreign currency exposure and interest rate risk through its use of derivative instruments and hedging activities 

  

commodity price risk 

a substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change accordingly product margins and the level of our profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the business cycle we try to protect against such instability through various business strategies these include provisions in sales contracts allowing us to pass on higher raw material costs through timely price increases formula price contracts to transfer or share commodity price risk and increasing the depth and breadth of our product portfolio 

in addition we use commodity swap and futures contracts with various terms to manage a small portion of the volatility related to raw materials and product purchases and sales such contracts are generally limited to durations of one year or less hedge accounting has not been elected for most of our commodity contracts in the periods presented market risks created by these derivative instruments and the marktomarket valuations of open positions are considered by management prior to execution and monitored daily 

the estimated fair value and notional amounts of our open commodity futures contracts and swap contracts are shown in the table below 

 

 we use value at risk “var” stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes 

var estimates the maximum potential loss in fair market values given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time using specified confidence levels 

  

using sensitivity analysis and hypothetical changes in market prices ranging from 14 to 17 which represent a three month volatility range of the underlying products noted in the table above the effect on our pretax income would be less than 1 million the quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account the effects of the underlying operating transactions 

foreign exchange risk 

we manufacture and market our products in a number of countries throughout the world and as a result are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we enter into transactions in currencies other than the applicable functional currency 

a significant portion of our reporting entities use the euro as their functional currency our reporting currency is the us dollar the translation gains or losses that result from the process of translating the euro denominated financial statements to us dollars are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” until such time as those entities may be liquidated or sold changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro can therefore have a significant impact on comprehensive income 

we have entered into hedging arrangements designated as net investment hedges to reduce the volatility from foreign currency fluctuation associated with our net investments in foreign operations and investments in foreign subsidiaries 

the table below illustrates the impact on other comprehensive loss of a 10 fluctuation in the foreign currency rate associated with each net investment hedge and the euribor and libor rates associated with basis swaps at december 31 2016 

 

 some of our operations enter into transactions that are not denominated in their functional currency this results in exposure to foreign currency risk for financial instruments including but not limited to third party and intercompany receivables and payables and intercompany loans 

we maintain risk management control practices to monitor the foreign currency risk attributable to our intercompany and third party outstanding foreign currency balances these practices involve the centralization of our exposure to underlying currencies that are not subject to central bank andor country specific restrictions by centralizing most of our foreign currency exposure into one subsidiary we are able to take advantage of any natural offsets thereby reducing the overall impact of changes in foreign currency rates on our earnings at december 31 2016 a 10 fluctuation compared to the us dollar in the underlying currencies that have no central bank or other currency restrictions related to nonhedged monetary net assets would have had a resulting additional impact to earnings of less than 1 million 

our policy is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies to minimize exchange gains and losses arising from changes in exchange rates to minimize the effects of our net currency exchange exposures we enter into foreign currency spot and forward contracts and in some cases crosscurrency swaps 

  

we also engage in shortterm foreign exchange swaps in order to roll certain hedge positions and to make funds available for intercompany financing our net position in foreign currencies is monitored daily 

we have entered into 2300 million of noncancellable crosscurrency swaps which we designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges to reduce the variability in the functional currency equivalent cash flows of certain foreign currency denominated intercompany notes for a summary of the estimated fair value and notional amounts for our crosscurrency swaps outstanding at december 31 2016 see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

for 2016 2015 and 2014 other income net in the consolidated statements of income reflected losses of 4 million and 7 million and a gain of 15 million respectively in net exchange rate gains and losses for forward contracts including swap transactions that economically hedge recognized monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies no hedge accounting is applied changes in the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are reported in the consolidated statements of income and offset the currency exchange results recognized on the assets and liabilities 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our fixed and variable rate debt fluctuations in interest rates impact the fair value of fixedrate debt as well as pretax earnings stemming from interest expense on variablerate debt 

fixedrate debt —we entered into interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy at december 31 2016 the total notional amounts of forwardstarting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges and interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges were 1000 million and 2600 million respectively 

at december 31 2016 after giving consideration to the 2600 million of fixedrate debt that we have effectively converted to floating through these us dollar fixedforfloating interest rate swaps approximately 66 of our debt portfolio on a gross basis incurred interest at a fixedrate and the remaining 34 of the portfolio incurred interest at a variablerate we estimate that a 10 change in market interest rates as of december 31 2016 would change the fair value of our interest rate swaps outstanding and would have had a resulting impact on our pretax income of approximately 12 million 

variablerate debt —our variable rate debt consists of our 2500 million senior revolving credit facility our 900 million us receivables securitization facility and 500 million outstanding at december 31 2016 under our commercial paper program at december 31 2016 there were no outstanding borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility and us receivables securitization facility we estimate that a 10 change in interest rates would have had less than a 1 million impact on earnings

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

overview 

lyondellbasell industries nv is a global independent chemical company and was incorporated under dutch law on october 15 2009 unless otherwise indicated the “company” “we” “our” “us” and “lyondellbasell” are used in this report to refer to the businesses of lyondellbasell industries nv and its consolidated subsidiaries we are one of the world’s top five independent chemical companies based on revenues 

we participate globally across the petrochemical value chain and are an industry leader in many of our product lines our chemicals businesses consist primarily of large processing plants that convert large volumes of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon feedstocks into plastic resins and other chemicals our chemical products tend to be basic building blocks for other chemicals and plastics while our plastic products are typically used in large volume applications our customers use our plastics and chemicals to manufacture a wide range of products that people use in their everyday lives including food packaging home furnishings automotive components paints and coatings our refining business consists of our houston refinery which processes crude oil into products such as gasoline diesel and jet fuel 

our financial performance is influenced in general by the supply and demand for the products that we produce the cost and availability of feedstocks global and regional competitor capacity our operational efficiency and our ability to control costs we have a strong operational focus and as a producer of large volume commodities continuously strive to differentiate ourselves through safe reliable and lowcost operations in all our businesses during recent years the cost of natural gasderived raw materials in the us versus the global cost of crude oilderived raw materials has had a significant positive influence on the profitability of our north american operations while the north american feedstock advantage declined with lower oil prices in 2015 improved product supply and demand fundamentals in several businesses notably global polyolefins products more than offset the decline to a lesser extent our differentiated assets and technology also positively influence our performance as compared to our peers and competitors these include our propylene oxide and polypropylene technologies flexible feedstock olefins plants in the us joint venture olefins and polyolefins plants with access to lowcost feedstock particularly in saudi arabia and our houston refinery which is capable of processing heavy highsulfur crude 

segments 

we manage our operations through five operating segments our reportable segments are 

 

  

  

  

  

   

we regularly review our segments and the approach used by management to evaluate performance and resource allocation at the beginning of 2014 management began using ebitda earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization as the primary measure for reviewing our segments’ profitability our comparisons to the prior periods presented were revised to reflect this change 

financial information about our business segments and geographical areas can be found in note 22 segment and related information  to the consolidated financial statements information about the locations where we produce our primary products can be found under “description of properties” 

in 2015 2014 and 2013 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues 

olefins and polyolefins segments generally 

we are one of the leading worldwide producers of olefins including ethylene and propylene and polyethylene “pe” we are the world’s largest producer of polypropylene “pp” and pp compounds we manage our olefin and polyolefin business in two reportable segments op—americas and op—eai 

olefins —ethylene is the most significant petrochemical in terms of worldwide production volume and is the key building block for pe and a large number of other chemicals plastics and synthetics the production of ethylene results in coproducts such as aromatics and other olefins including propylene and butadiene ethylene and its coproducts are fundamental to many parts of the economy including the production of consumer products packaging housing and automotive components and other durable and nondurable goods in 2015 we completed an expansion project at our channelview texas facility that added 250 million pounds to our annual ethylene capacity and we further benefited from an 800 million pound per year expansion of our la porte texas ethylene facility that was completed in 2014 

polyolefins —polyolefins are thermoplastics and comprise approximately twothirds of worldwide thermoplastics demand since their industrial commercialization thermoplastics have been used in wideranging applications and products that improve safety and comfort and enhance the everyday quality of life our products are used in consumer automotive and industrial applications ranging from food and beverage packaging to housewares and construction materials we produce high density polyethylene “hdpe” low density polyethylene “ldpe” and linear low density polyethylene “lldpe” we also produce pp homopolymers pp impact copolymers and pp random copolymers we produce and market several specialty product lines including pp compounds catalloy process resins and polybutene1 “pb1” focusing on unique polyolefins and compounds that offer a wide range of performance characteristics typical properties of such specialty polyolefins and compounds include impactstiffness balance scratch resistance soft touch and heat sealability end uses include automotive and industrial products and materials pp compounds are produced from blends of polyolefins and additives and are sold mainly to the automotive and home appliances industries the catalloy process is proprietary technology that is not licensed to third parties as a result we are the only manufacturer of catalloy process resins which are used primarily in roofing packaging and automotive applications pb1 is a family of butanebased polymers and is mainly used in pipe applications and underfloor heating systems and sanitary water heating systems 

pe sales including hdpe ldpe and lldpe accounted for approximately 21 18 and 17 of our total revenues in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively in 2014 we completed an expansion project at our matagorda plant in texas which added 220 million pounds of hdpe production pp sales including catalloy  accounted for approximately 17 16 and 16 of our total revenues in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

  

the following table outlines the primary products of our op segments annual processing capacity as of december 31 2015 and the primary uses for those products capacities which are presented in pounds unless otherwise indicated include 100 of the capacity of our joint venture facilities the joint ventures’ proportional share of capacity is shown in the footnote to the table below 

 

   

   

 

 olefins and polyolefins—americas segment 

overview 

our op—americas segment produces and markets olefins polyolefins aromatics specialty products and ethylene coproducts in addition we produce specialty products including catalloy and plexar resins 

sales  marketing  customers 

our ethylene production is consumed internally as a raw material in the production of polymers and other derivatives with the balance sold to third party customers under multiyear contracts or on a spot basis in 2015 we completed a 250 million pound per year expansion at our channelview texas facility following an 800 million pound per year expansion of our la porte texas facility completed in mid2014 we have also announced ethylene expansion projects for our corpus christi texas facility in 2016 

we are a net purchaser of propylene a raw material used in the production of po pp and other derivatives our butadiene production is sold to the external market under multiyear contracts all of our benzene production is used as a raw material in the production of styrene by our id segment 

in addition to purchases of propylene at times we purchase ethylene and butadiene for resale when necessary to satisfy customer demand above our own production levels volumes of any of these products purchased for resale can vary significantly from period to period however purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profits 

in the us most of the ethylene and propylene production of our channelview corpus christi and la porte texas facilities is shipped via a pipeline system which has connections to numerous us gulf coast consumers this pipeline extends from corpus christi to mont belvieu texas in addition exchange agreements with other ethylene and coproducts producers allow access to customers who are not directly connected to this pipeline system some ethylene is shipped by rail car from clinton iowa to morris illinois and some is shipped directly to customers a pipeline owned and operated by an unrelated party is used to transport ethylene from morris illinois to tuscola illinois where it is used as a raw material in the production of ethanol some propylene is shipped by ocean going vessel butadiene benzene toluene and other products are distributed by pipeline rail car truck barge or ocean going vessel 

our pp and pe production is typically sold through our sales organization to an extensive base of established customers and distributors servicing both the domestic and export markets either under annual contracts or on a spot basis we have regional sales offices in various locations in north america and our polyolefins primarily are transported in north america by railcar or truck export sales are generally to customers in central and south america we also sell pp to our pp compounds business which is managed worldwide by our op—eai segment 

joint venture relationships 

we participate in a joint venture arrangement in mexico which provides us with capacity for approximately 640 million pounds of pp production the capacity is based on our percentage ownership of the joint ventures’ total capacity we do not hold a majority interest in or have operational control of this joint venture 

  

raw materials 

raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost for the production of ethylene and its coproducts the primary raw materials that can be used in our americas olefin facilities are heavy liquids and natural gas liquids “ngls” heavy liquids include crude oilbased naphtha and other refined products as well as domestically sourced condensate a very light crude oil resulting from natural gas production collectively referred to as “heavy liquids” ngls include ethane propane and butane the use of heavy liquid raw materials results in the production of a significant amount of coproducts such as propylene butadiene and benzene as well as gasoline blending components while the use of ngls results in the production of a smaller amount of coproducts 

our ability to pass through raw material price increases to our customers is dependent upon marketdriven demand for olefins and polyolefins sales prices for products sold in the spot market are determined by market forces our contract prices are influenced by spot prices indices published in industry publications and cost recovery formulas in the contracts 

prior to 2010 facilities using heavy liquids as feedstock usually generated higher margins than those using ngls however in recent years ngls particularly in the united states have had a significant cost advantage over heavy liquids due to technological advances for extracting shale gas which have led to an increased supply of ngls this cost advantage was lower in 2015 than in prior years but was still significant a plant’s flexibility to consume a wide range of raw materials generally will provide an advantage over plants that are restricted in their processing capabilities our americas facilities can process significant quantities of either heavy liquids or ngls we estimate that in the us we can produce up to approximately 90 of our total ethylene output using ngls changes in the raw material feedstock utilized in the production process will result in variances in production capacities among products we believe our raw material flexibility in the us is a key advantage in our production of ethylene and its coproducts 

in north america we also purchase large amounts of natural gas that is used primarily as an energy source in our business and as the primary feedstock for methanol production by our id segment the purchases are generally marketbased contractual arrangements with multiple suppliers 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to olefins and polyolefins competition is based on price product quality product delivery reliability of supply product performance and customer service industry consolidation in north america has led to fewer although larger competitors profitability is affected not only by supply and demand for olefins and polyolefins but also by raw material costs and price competition among producers which may intensify due to among other things the addition of new capacity in general demand is a function of worldwide economic growth including the regional dynamics that underlie global growth trends 

we compete in north america with other large marketers and producers including global chemical companies chemical divisions of large oil companies and regional marketers and producers 

based on published data we believe we were as of december 31 2015 

 

  

  

   

olefins and polyolefins—europe asia international segment 

overview 

our op—eai segment produces and markets olefins including ethylene and ethylene coproducts and polyolefins in addition we produce significant quantities of specialty products such as catalloy process resins and pb1 our op—eai segment manages our worldwide pp compound business including our pp compounds facilities in north and south america our worldwide pb1 business and our catalloy process resins produced in europe 

sales  marketing  customers 

our ethylene production is primarily consumed internally as a raw material in the production of polymers and we purchase additional ethylene to meet our production needs our propylene production is used as a raw material in the production of po and pp and we purchase propylene because our internal needs exceed our internal production european ethylene production is generally fully integrated with our downstream facilities in europe 

we produce and sell butadiene to external customers under multiyear contracts and on a spot basis 

with respect to pp and pe our production is typically sold through our sales organization to an extensive base of established customers under annual contracts or on a spot basis and is also sold through distributors our polyolefins are transported in europe primarily by railcar or truck we believe that over a business cycle average sales prices and profit margins for specialty polymers tend to be higher than average sales prices and profit margins for highervolume commodity polyolefins or polymers 

our regional sales offices are in various locations including the netherlands hong kong china india australia and the united arab emirates we also operate through a worldwide network of local sales and representative offices in europe asia and africa our joint ventures described below typically manage their domestic sales and marketing efforts independently and we typically operate as their agentdistributor for all or a portion of their exports 

joint venture relationships 

we participate in several manufacturing joint ventures in saudi arabia thailand poland australia japan and south korea we do not hold majority interests in any of these joint ventures nor do we have operational control these ventures provide us with additional production capacity of approximately 2630 million pounds of pp approximately 810 million pounds of propylene approximately 550 million pounds of ethylene approximately 570 million pounds of hdpe approximately 340 million pounds of ldpe and approximately 160 million pounds of pp compounds these capacities are based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint ventures’ total capacities we realize profits or losses from these ventures as income or loss on the equity basis of accounting 

we generally license our polyolefin process technologies and supply catalysts to our joint ventures through our technology segment some of our joint ventures are able to source cost advantaged raw materials from their local shareholders 

raw materials 

raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost for the production of ethylene and its coproducts the primary raw materials used in our european olefin facilities are naphtha streams which are heavier than ngls however in recent years we have sourced increased amounts of advantaged ngls when the opportunity arises for our saudi joint venture facilities locally sourced and cost advantaged ngls including 

  

ethane propane and butane are used the principal raw materials used by our polyolefin and catalloy process resin businesses are propylene and ethylene in europe we have the capacity to produce approximately 50 of the propylene requirements of our european pp business and all of the ethylene requirements of our european pe business propylene and ethylene requirements that are not produced internally are generally acquired pursuant to longterm contracts with third party suppliers or via spot purchases 

our pp compounds facilities generally receive their pp and other polymer raw materials from one of our wholly owned or joint venture facilities pb1 raw materials are sourced solely from external supply some of our joint ventures receive propylene and ethylene from their local shareholders under longterm contracts 

our ability to pass through the increased cost of raw materials to customers is dependent on global market demand for olefins and polyolefins in general the pricing for purchases and sales of most products is determined by global market forces including the impacts of foreign exchange on the pricing of the underlying heavy liquid raw materials most of which are priced in us dollars there can be a lag between observed naphtha raw material price changes in a given month and contract product price changes that were settled prior to the beginning of that month in such cases volatility in our product margins may occur 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to olefins and polyolefins competition is based on price product quality product delivery reliability of supply product performance and customer service we compete with regional and multinational chemical companies and divisions of large oil companies the petrochemical market in the european union “eu” has been affected by the price volatility of naphtha the primary feedstock for olefins in the region as well as fluctuating demand as a result of uncertain european and global economic conditions 

based on published data and including our proportionate share of our joint ventures we believe we were as of december 31 2015 

 

  

  

  

 intermediates and derivatives segment 

overview 

our id segment produces and markets po and its coproducts and derivatives acetyls including methanol ethylene oxide “eo” and its derivatives ethanol and oxyfuels methyl tertiary butyl ether “mtbe” and ethyl tertiary butyl ether “etbe” po coproducts include styrene monomer “sm” and tertiary butyl alcohol “tba” most of which is used to make oxyfuels isobutylene and tertiary butyl hydro peroxide “tbhp” tba and its products other than oxyfuels are sometimes referred to as c4 chemicals po derivatives include propylene glycol “pg” propylene glycol ethers “pge” and butanediol “bdo” we believe that our proprietary po and acetyls production process technologies provide us with a cost advantaged position for these products and their derivatives 

  

we produce po through two distinct technologies one of which yields tba as the coproduct and the other of which yields sm as the coproduct the two technologies are mutually exclusive meaning that a manufacturing facility must be dedicated to either potba or to posm 

the following table outlines the primary products annual capacities and primary uses for the id segment’s products capacities which are presented in pounds unless otherwise indicated include 100 of the capacity of joint venture facilities the joint ventures’ proportional share of capacity is shown in the footnote to the table below 

 

   

  

 sales  marketing  customers 

we sell our po and its coproducts and derivatives through multiyear sales and processing agreements as well as spot sales some of our contract sales agreements have cost plus pricing terms we sell most of our sm production into the north american european asian and south american export markets through spot sales and contracts we purchase sm for resale when necessary to satisfy customer demand that exceeds our production levels volumes of sm purchases made for resale can vary significantly from period to period however purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profits po and its derivatives and sm are transported by barge ocean going vessel pipeline railcar and tank truck 

our id segment converts most of its tba which is produced as a coproduct of the po process to isobutylene over half of the isobutylene is reacted with methanol or ethanol to produce either mtbe or etbe the remaining isobutylene is sold into the external market as highpurity grade isobutylene 

in august of 2014 we announced our intention to build a world scale potba plant on the us gulf coast with an annual capacity of 1 billion pounds of po and 2 billion pounds of tba and its derivatives the preliminary timetable is to have the plant operational in 2020 

we sell our mtbe and etbe production under market and costbased sales agreements and in the spot market mtbe and etbe are transported by barge ocean going vessel and tank truck mtbe and etbe are widely used octane gasoline blending components worldwide outside of the united states due to their blending characteristics and environmental benefits for example japan has elected to use etbe as a means of meeting its carbon dioxide reduction commitments under the kyoto protocol and we source a significant portion of japan’s biofuels needs the majority of our plants have the flexibility to produce either mtbe or etbe to accommodate market needs 

sales of mtbe etbe acetyls po and po coproducts and derivatives are made by our marketing and sales personnel and also through distributors and independent agents in the americas europe the middle east africa and the asia pacific region 

acetyls including acetic acid and vam are consumed internally and sold worldwide under multiyear contracts and on a spot basis acetic acid and vam are shipped by barge ocean going vessel pipeline railcar 

  

and tank truck sales are made through a direct sales force agents and distributors our acetyls business uses methanol which we produce internally as a raw material for our production of acetic acid solvents and mtbe we also sell methanol under annual contracts and on a spot basis to large us customers methanol is shipped by barge railcar and pipeline 

eo and eg typically are sold under multiyear contracts and on a spot basis with market and costbased pricing ethylene glycol ethers are eo derivatives sold primarily into the solvent and distributor segments at market prices the vast majority of eo and its derivative products are sold in north america europe and asia primarily through our sales organizations eo is shipped by railcar or consumed on site the derivatives are shipped by railcar truck isotank and ocean going vessel 

joint venture relationships 

we have two po joint ventures with covestro ag the new holding company under which bayer ag consolidated its polymer activities one in the us and one in europe we operate four of our us operating units for the us po joint venture covestro’s interest represents ownership of an inkind portion of the po production of 15 billion pounds per year we take inkind the remaining po production and all coproduct production the parties’ rights in the joint venture are based on off take volumes related to actual production of po as opposed to ownership percentages covestro also has the right to 50 of the po and sm production of our european po joint venture our proportional production capacity provided through this venture is approximately 340 million pounds of po and approximately 750 million pounds of sm we do not share marketing or product sales with covestro under either of these po joint ventures 

we also have joint venture manufacturing relationships in china these ventures provide us with additional production capacity of approximately 115 million pounds of po this capacity is based on our operational share of the joint ventures’ total capacities 

raw materials 

the cost of raw materials is generally the largest component of total production cost for po its coproducts and its derivatives propylene isobutane or mixed butane ethylene and benzene are the primary raw materials used in the production of po and its coproducts the market prices of these raw materials historically have been related to the price of crude oil ngls and natural gas as well as supply and demand for the raw materials 

in the us we obtain a large portion of our propylene benzene and ethylene raw materials needed for the production of po and its coproducts from our op—americas segment and a lesser amount from third parties raw materials for the nonus production of po and its coproducts are obtained from our op—eai segment and from third parties we consume a significant portion of our internallyproduced po in the production of po derivatives 

the raw material requirements not sourced internally are purchased at marketbased prices from numerous suppliers in the us and europe with which we have established contractual relationships as well as in the spot market 

we purchase our ethanol requirements for the production of etbe from third parties the methanol for our mtbe production comes from internal production carbon monoxide and methanol are the primary raw materials required for the production of acetic acid we purchase carbon monoxide pursuant to a longterm contract with pricing primarily based on the cost of production all methanol required for our production of acetyls is internally sourced natural gas is the primary raw material required for the production of methanol 

in addition to ethylene acetic acid is a primary raw material for the production of vam for the production of vam we obtain our entire requirements for acetic acid and ethylene from our internal production historically we have used a large percentage of our acetic acid production to produce vam 

  

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to po its coproducts and derivatives competition is based on a variety of factors including product quality price reliability of supply technical support customer service and potential substitute materials profitability is affected by the worldwide level of demand along with price competition which may intensify due to among other things new industry capacity and industry outages po demand growth could be impacted by further development of alternative biobased po derivatives it is not possible to predict accurately the changes in raw material costs market conditions and other factors that will affect industry profitability in the future our major worldwide competitors for sales of po its coproducts and derivatives include other multinational chemical companies as well as some regional marketers and producers 

based on published data excluding our partners’ shares of joint venture capacity we believe as of december 31 2015 we were 

 

  

  

  

 refining segment 

overview 

our houston refinery which is located on the houston ship channel in houston texas has a heavy highsulfur crude oil processing capacity of approximately 268000 barrels per day on a calendar day basis normal operating basis or approximately 292000 barrels per day on a stream day basis maximum achievable over a 24 hour period the houston refinery has a nelson complexity index a relative measure of the construction costs of a particular refinery based on its crude and upgrading capacity of 125 the houston refinery is a full conversion refinery designed to refine heavy highsulfur crude oil this crude oil is more viscous and dense than traditional crude oil and contains higher concentrations of sulfur and heavy metals making it more difficult to refine into gasoline and other highvalue fuel products however this crude oil has historically been less costly to purchase than light lowsulfur crude oil such as brent in the recent past certain domestic crude oils such as west texas intermediate “wti” and west texas sour “wts” have been priced lower than normal trends due to transportation constraints however since 2014 these price differentials have narrowed 

on january 4 2012 we ceased refinery operations at our berre refinery in france the cessation of operations was in accordance with an agreement executed in the fourth quarter of 2011 by certain of our french subsidiaries and union representatives additional information about the cessation of operations can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 3 discontinued operations  to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the following table outlines the primary products of our refining segment annual processing capacities as of as of december 31 2015 and the primary uses for those products capacities are presented in barrels per day 

 

  

 sales  marketing  customers 

the houston refinery’s products primarily are sold in bulk to other refiners marketers distributors and wholesalers at marketrelated prices most of the houston refinery’s products are sold under contracts with a term of one year or less or are sold in the spot market the houston refinery’s products generally are transported to customers via pipelines and terminals owned and operated by other parties 

raw materials 

we purchase the crude oil used as a raw material for the houston refinery on the open market on a spot basis and under a number of supply agreements with regional producers generally with terms varying from one to two years 

industry dynamics  competition 

our refining competitors are major integrated oil companies refineries owned or controlled by foreign governments and independent domestic refiners based on published data as of january 2016 there were 140 operable crude oil refineries in the us and total us refinery capacity was approximately 180 million barrels per day during 2015 the houston refinery processed an average of approximately 243000 barrels per day of crude oil representing approximately 14 of all us crude processing capacity 

our refining operations compete for the purchases of crude oil based on price and quality supply disruptions could impact the availability and pricing we compete in gasoline and distillate markets as a bulk supplier of fungible products satisfying industry and government specifications competition is based on price and location 

the markets for fuel products tend to be volatile as well as cyclical as a result of the changing global economy and changing crude oil and refined product prices crude oil prices are impacted by worldwide political events the economics of exploration and production and refined products demand prices and demand for fuel products are influenced by seasonal and shortterm factors such as weather and driving patterns as well as by longer term issues such as the economy energy conservation and alternative fuels industry fuel products supply is dependent on shortterm industry operating capabilities and on longterm refining capacity 

a crack spread is a benchmark indication of refining margins based on the processing of a specific type of crude oil into an assumed selection of major refined products the houston refinery generally tracks the maya 211 crack spread which represents the difference between the current month gulf coast price of two 

  

barrels of maya crude oil as set by petróleos mexicanos “pemex” and one barrel each of us gulf coast reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending “rbob” gasoline and of us gulf coast ultralowsulfur diesel “ulsd” while these benchmark refining spreads are generally indicative of the level of profitability at the houston refinery and similarly configured refineries there are many other factors specific to each refinery and the industry in general which influence operating results such as the value of refinery byproducts products other than gasoline and distillates that represent about one third of the total product volume such as coke sulfur and lighter materials such as ngls and crude olefins streams and the cost of renewable identification numbers “rins” 

technology segment

general 




 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 

our business including our results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected by safety or product liability issues 

failure to appropriately manage safety human health product liability and environmental risks associated with our products product life cycles and production processes could adversely impact employees communities stakeholders our reputation and our results of operations public perception of the risks associated with our products and production processes could impact product acceptance and influence the regulatory environment in which we operate while we have procedures and controls to manage safety risks issues could be created by events outside of our control including natural disasters severe weather events and acts of sabotage 

our operations are subject to risks inherent in chemical and refining businesses and we could be subject to liabilities for which we are not fully insured or that are not otherwise mitigated 

we maintain property business interruption product general liability casualty and other types of insurance that we believe are in accordance with customary industry practices however we are not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to our business including losses resulting from natural disasters wars or terrorist acts changes in insurance market conditions have caused and may in the future cause premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies to increase substantially and in some instances for certain insurance to become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured we might not be able to finance the amount of the uninsured liability on terms acceptable to us or at all and might be obligated to divert a significant portion of our cash flow from normal business operations 

further because a part of our business involves licensing polyolefin process technology our licensees are exposed to similar risks involved in the manufacture and marketing of polyolefins hazardous incidents involving our licensees if they do result or are perceived to result from use of our technologies may harm our reputation threaten our relationships with other licensees andor lead to customer attrition and financial losses our policy of covering these risks through contractual limitations of liability and indemnities and through insurance may not always be effective as a result our financial condition and results of operation would be adversely affected and other companies with competing technologies may have the opportunity to secure a competitive advantage 

our ability to source raw materials may be adversely affected by political instability civil disturbances or other governmental actions 

we obtain a substantial portion of our principal raw materials from sources in north africa the middle east mexico and south america that may be less politically stable than other areas in which we conduct business such as europe or the us political instability civil disturbances and actions by governments in these areas are likely to substantially increase the price and decrease the supply of raw materials necessary for our operations which will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

increased incidents of civil unrest including terrorist attacks and demonstrations that have been marked by violence have occurred in a number of countries in north africa and the middle east some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest political instability and civil unrest could continue to spread in the region and involve other areas such unrest if it continues to spread or grow in intensity could lead to civil wars regional conflicts or regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to countries in which we conduct substantial business such as in europe the us or their respective allies 

  

a continued decrease in the price of crude oil may adversely impact the results of our operations primarily in north america 

energy costs generally follow price trends of crude oil and natural gas these price trends may be highly volatile and cyclical in the past raw material and energy costs have experienced significant fluctuations that adversely affected our business segments’ results of operations for example we have benefitted from the favorable ratio of us natural gas prices to crude oil prices in recent years this advantage was reduced as oil prices declined beginning in 2014 if the price of crude oil continues to decrease and it remains lower relative to us natural gas prices or if the demand for natural gas and ngls increases this may have a negative impact on our results of operations 

costs and limitations on supply of raw materials and energy may result in increased operating expenses 

the costs of raw materials and energy represent a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to the significant competition we face and the commodity nature of many of our products we are not always able to pass on raw material and energy cost increases to our customers when we do have the ability to pass on the cost increases we are not always able to do so quickly enough to avoid adverse impacts on our results of operations 

cost increases for raw materials also may increase working capital needs which could reduce our liquidity and cash flow even if we increase our sales prices to reflect rising raw material and energy costs demand for products may decrease as customers reduce their consumption or use substitute products which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition producers in natural gas costadvantaged regions such as the middle east and north america benefit from the lower prices of natural gas and ngls competition from producers in these regions may cause us to reduce exports from europe and elsewhere any such reductions may increase competition for product sales within europe and other markets which can result in lower margins in those regions 

for some of our raw materials and utilities there are a limited number of suppliers and in some cases the supplies are specific to the particular geographic region in which a facility is located it is also common in the chemical and refining industries for a facility to have a sole dedicated source for its utilities such as steam electricity and gas having a sole or limited number of suppliers may limit our negotiating power particularly in the case of rising raw material costs any new supply agreements we enter into may not have terms as favorable as those contained in our current supply agreements 

additionally there is growing concern over the reliability of water sources including around the texas gulf coast where several of our facilities are located the decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of population growth drought or regulation could negatively impact our operations 

if our raw material or utility supplies were disrupted our businesses may incur increased costs to procure alternative supplies or incur excessive downtime which would have a direct negative impact on plant operations disruptions of supplies may occur as a result of transportation issues including but not limited to as a result of natural disasters and water levels that can affect the operations of vessels barges rails trucks and pipeline traffic these risks are particularly prevalent in the us gulf coast area additionally the export of ngls from the us greater restrictions on hydraulic fracturing or the lifting by the us government of the ban on us crude oil exports could restrict the availability of our raw materials thereby increasing our costs 

with increased volatility in raw material costs our suppliers could impose more onerous terms on us resulting in shorter payment cycles and increasing our working capital requirements 

  

economic disruptions and downturns in general and particularly continued global economic uncertainty or economic turmoil in emerging markets could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

our results of operations can be materially affected by adverse conditions in the financial markets and depressed economic conditions generally economic downturns in the businesses and geographic areas in which we sell our products substantially reduce demand for our products and result in decreased sales volumes and increased credit risk recessionary environments adversely affect our business because demand for our products is reduced particularly from our customers in industrial markets generally and the automotive and housing industries specifically and may result in higher costs of capital a significant portion of our revenues and earnings are derived from our business in europe including southern europe in addition most of our european transactions and assets including cash reserves and receivables are denominated in euros 

europe’s recovery from the economic crisis has continued to be uneven slow and modest if the crisis reemerges or meaningful recovery does not materialize across europe there will likely be a continued negative effect on our european business as well as the businesses of our european customers suppliers and partners in addition if such a crisis reemerges and leads to a further significant devaluation of the euro the value of our financial assets that are denominated in euros would be significantly reduced when translated to us dollars for financial reporting purposes we also derive significant revenues from our business in emerging markets particularly the emerging markets in asia and brazil any broadbased downturn in these emerging markets or in a key market such as china could require us to reduce export volumes into these markets and could also require us to divert product sales to less profitable markets any of these conditions could ultimately harm our overall business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

the cyclicality and volatility of the industries in which we participate may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 

our business operations are subject to the cyclical and volatile nature of the supplydemand balance in the chemical and refining industries our future operating results are expected to continue to be affected by this cyclicality and volatility the chemical and refining industries historically have experienced alternating periods of capacity shortages causing prices and profit margins to increase followed by periods of excess capacity resulting in oversupply declining capacity utilization rates and declining prices and profit margins 

in addition to changes in the supply and demand for products changes in energy prices and other worldwide economic conditions can cause volatility these factors result in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over business cycles 

new capacity additions in asia the middle east and north america may lead to periods of oversupply and lower profitability a sizable number of expansions have been announced in north america the timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions are uncertain and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time as a consequence we are unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of future industry cycles or their effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we sell products in highly competitive global markets and face significant price pressures 

we sell our products in highly competitive global markets due to the commodity nature of many of our products competition in these markets is based primarily on price and to a lesser extent on product performance product quality product deliverability reliability of supply and customer service generally we are not able to protect our market position for these products by product differentiation and may not be able to pass on cost increases to our customers due to the significant competition in our business 

in addition we face increased competition from companies that may have greater financial resources and different cost structures or strategic goals than us these include large integrated oil companies some of which 

  

also have chemical businesses governmentowned businesses and companies that receive subsidies or other government incentives to produce certain products in a specified geographic region continuing increased competition from these companies especially in our olefin and refining businesses could limit our ability to increase product sales prices in response to raw material and other cost increases or could cause us to reduce product sales prices to compete effectively which could reduce our profitability competitors that have greater financial resources than us may be able to invest significant capital into their businesses including expenditures for research and development 

in addition specialty products we produce may become commoditized over time increased competition could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 

interruptions of operations at our facilities may result in liabilities or lower operating results 

we own and operate largescale facilities our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our various production facilities and the ability to complete construction and maintenance projects on schedule interruptions at our facilities may materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or our business as a whole during and after the period of such operational difficulties in the past we had to shut down plants on the us gulf coast including the temporary shutdown of our houston refinery as a result of hurricanes striking the texas coast 

in addition because the houston refinery is our only refining operation an outage at the refinery could have a particularly negative impact on our operating results unlike our chemical and polymer production facilities which may have sufficient excess capacity to mitigate the negative impact of lost production at other facilities we do not have the ability to increase refining production elsewhere in the us 

although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions our operations are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and refining and the related storage and transportation of raw materials products and wastes these potential hazards include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or personal injury and loss of life and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date negatively impacting project returns if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering procurement and construction of facilities could materially adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors many of which are beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects if we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs or if market conditions change it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increased it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products facilities and services 

increased global information security threats and more sophisticated targeted computer crime pose a risk to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data operations and infrastructure while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our employees systems networks products facilities and services remain potentially vulnerable to sophisticated espionage or continual cyberassault depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations 

we operate internationally and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations exchange controls political risks and other risks relating to international operations 

we operate internationally and are subject to the risks of doing business on a global level these risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates economic instability and disruptions restrictions on the transfer 

  

of funds and the imposition of duties and tariffs additional risks from our multinational business include transportation delays and interruptions war terrorist activities epidemics pandemics political instability import and export controls changes in governmental policies labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments 

we generate revenues from export sales and operations that may be denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency exchange rates between these currencies and functional currencies in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future it is possible that fluctuations in exchange rates will result in reduced operating results additionally we operate with the objective of having our worldwide cash available in the locations where it is needed including the united kingdom for our parent company’s significant cash obligations as a result of dividend and interest payments it is possible that we may not always be able to provide cash to other jurisdictions when needed or that such transfers of cash could be subject to additional taxes including withholding taxes 

our operating results could be negatively affected by the global laws rules and regulations as well as political environments in the jurisdictions in which we operate there could be reduced demand for our products decreases in the prices at which we can sell our products and disruptions of production or other operations additionally there may be substantial capital and other costs to comply with regulations andor increased security costs or insurance premiums any of which could reduce our operating results 

we obtain a substantial portion of our principal raw materials from international sources that are subject to these same risks our compliance with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject could be challenged furthermore these laws may be modified the result of which may be to prevent or limit subsidiaries from transferring cash to us 

furthermore we are subject to certain existing and may be subject to possible future laws that limit or may limit our activities while some of our competitors may not be subject to such laws which may adversely affect our competitiveness 

changes in tax laws and regulations could affect our tax rate and our results of operations 

we are a tax resident in the united kingdom and are subject to the united kingdom corporate income tax system lyondellbasell nv has little or no taxable income of its own because as a holding company it does not conduct any operations through our subsidiaries we have substantial operations worldwide taxes are primarily paid on the earnings generated in various jurisdictions including the united states the netherlands germany france and italy we monitor income tax legislative developments in countries where we conduct business including the united kingdom recently there has been an increase in attention both in the uk and globally to the tax practices of multinational companies including proposals by the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” with respect to base erosion and profit shifting such attention may result in legislative changes that could affect our tax rate management does not believe that recent changes in income tax laws will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements although new or proposed changes to tax laws could affect our tax liabilities in the future 

failure to comply with the foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws may have an adverse effect on us 

our international operations require us to comply with a number of us and international laws and regulations including those involving antibribery and anticorruption in order to effectively operate in certain foreign jurisdictions circumstances may require that we establish joint ventures with local operators or find strategic partners as an issuer with securities listed on a united states stock exchange we are subject to the regulations imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” which generally prohibits issuers and their 

  

intermediaries including strategic or local partners or agents even if those partners or agents are not themselves subject to the fcpa or other similar laws from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or obtaining an improper business benefit we have an ongoing program to promote compliance with the fcpa and other similar antibribery and anticorruption laws any determination that we have violated the fcpa or other similar laws could have a material effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

many of our businesses depend on our intellectual property our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and our inability to do so could reduce our ability to maintain our competitiveness and margins 

we have a significant worldwide patent portfolio of issued and pending patents these patents and patent applications together with proprietary technical knowhow are significant to our competitive position particularly with regard to po performance chemicals petrochemicals and polymers including process technologies such as spheripol  spherizone  hostalen  spherilene  lupotech t and avant catalyst family technology rights we rely on the patent copyright and trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing however we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without authorization proceedings to protect these rights could be costly and we may not prevail 

the protection afforded by patents varies from country to country and depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage while a presumption of validity may exist with respect to patents issued to us our patents may be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable as patents expire the products and processes described and claimed under those patents become generally available for use by competitors 

our continued growth strategy may bring us to regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce in addition patent rights may not prevent our competitors from developing using or selling products that are similar or functionally equivalent to our products moreover our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner which could result in significantly lower revenues reduced profit margins or loss of market share 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary knowhow and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property these confidentiality agreements may be breached may not always be executed may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies may not be available additionally others could obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal or illegal means 

the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes apparatuses technology trade secrets or proprietary knowhow could result in significantly lower revenues reduced profit margins and cash flows andor loss of market share we also may be subject to claims that our technology patents or other intellectual property infringes on a third party’s intellectual property rights unfavorable resolution of these claims could result in restrictions on our ability to deliver the related service or in a settlement that could be material to us 

shared control or lack of control of joint ventures may delay decisions or actions regarding the joint ventures 

a portion of our operations are conducted through joint ventures where control may be exercised by or shared with unaffiliated third parties we cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners including any nonperformance default or bankruptcy of joint venture partners the joint ventures that we do not control may also lack adequate internal controls systems or financial reporting systems to provide adequate and timely information for our reporting purposes 

  

in the event that any of our joint venture partners do not observe their obligations it is possible that the affected joint venture would not be able to operate in accordance with our business plans as a result we could be required to increase our level of commitment in order to give effect to such plans differences in views among the joint venture participants also may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major matters potentially adversely affecting the business and operations of the joint ventures and in turn our business and operations 

we cannot predict with certainty the extent of future costs under environmental health and safety and other laws and regulations and cannot guarantee they will not be material 

we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture handle or own in addition because our products are components of a variety of other enduse products we along with other members of the chemical industry are subject to potential claims related to those enduse products any substantial increase in the success of these types of claims could negatively affect our operating results 

we together with the industries in which we operate are subject to extensive national regional state and local environmental laws regulations directives rules and ordinances concerning 

 

  

  

 many of these laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations in addition some of these laws and regulations require us to meet specific financial responsibility requirements any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

although we have compliance programs and other processes intended to ensure compliance with all such regulations we are subject to the risk that our compliance with such regulations could be challenged noncompliance with certain of these regulations could result in the incurrence of additional costs penalties or assessments that could be material 

our industry is subject to extensive government regulation and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures 

compliance with regulatory requirements could result in higher operating costs such as regulatory requirements relating to emissions the security of our facilities and the transportation export or registration of our products we generally expect that regulatory controls worldwide will become increasingly more demanding but cannot accurately predict future developments 

increasingly strict environmental laws and inspection and enforcement policies could affect the handling manufacture use emission or disposal of products other materials or hazardous and nonhazardous waste stricter environmental safety and health laws regulations and enforcement policies could result in increased operating costs or capital expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations additionally we are required to have permits for our businesses and are subject to licensing regulations these permits and licenses are subject to renewal modification and in some circumstances revocation further the permits and licenses are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

  

we may incur substantial costs to comply with climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives 

there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas “ghg” reduction these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future laws in this field continue to evolve and while they are likely to be increasingly widespread and stringent at this stage it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation within the framework of the eu emissions trading scheme “ets” we were allocated certain allowances of carbon dioxide for the affected plants of our european sites for the period from 2008 to 2012 “ets ii period” the ets ii period did not bring additional cost to us as the allowance allocation was sufficient to cover the actual emissions of the affected plants we were able to build an allowance surplus during the ets ii period which has been banked to the scheme for the period from 2013 to 2020 “ets iii period” we expect to incur additional costs for the ets iii period despite the allowance surplus accrued over the ets ii period as allowance allocations have been reduced for the ets iii period and more of our plants are affected by the scheme we maintain an active hedging strategy to cover these additional costs we expect to incur additional costs in relation to future carbon or ghg emission trading schemes 

in the us the environmental protection agency the “epa” has promulgated federal ghg regulations under the clean air act affecting certain sources the epa has issued mandatory ghg reporting requirements requirements to obtain ghg permits for certain industrial plants and proposals for ghg performance standards for some facilities the recent epa action could be a precursor to further federal regulation of carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases and may affect the outcome of other climate change lawsuits pending in us courts in a manner unfavorable to our industry in any event additional regulation may be forthcoming at the us federal or state level with respect to ghg emissions and such regulation could result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances 

compliance with these or other changes in laws regulations and obligations that create a ghg emissions trading scheme or ghg reduction policies generally could significantly increase our costs or reduce demand for products we produce additionally compliance with these regulations may result in increased permitting necessary for the operation of our business or for any of our growth plans difficulties in obtaining such permits could have an adverse effect on our future growth therefore any future potential regulations and legislation could result in increased compliance costs additional operating restrictions or delays in implementing growth projects or other capital investments and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may be required to record material charges against our earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets 

we may be required to reduce production at or idle facilities for extended periods of time or exit certain businesses as a result of the cyclical nature of our industry specifically oversupplies of or lack of demand for particular products or high raw material prices may cause us to reduce production we may choose to reduce production at certain facilities because we have offtake arrangements at other facilities which make any reductions or idling unavailable at those facilities any decision to permanently close facilities or exit a business likely would result in impairment and other charges to earnings 

temporary outages at our facilities can last for several quarters and sometimes longer these outages could cause us to incur significant costs including the expenses of maintaining and restarting these facilities in addition even though we may reduce production at facilities we may be required to continue to purchase or pay for utilities or raw materials under takeorpay supply agreements 

  

our business is capital intensive and we rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and ongoing capital needs limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results 

we require significant capital to operate our current business and fund our growth strategy moreover interest payments dividends and the expansion of our business or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital we believe that our cash from operations currently will be sufficient to meet these needs however if we need external financing our access to credit markets and pricing of our capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies and the state of the capital markets generally there can be no assurances that we would be able to incur indebtedness on terms we deem acceptable and it is possible that the cost of any financings could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities which could adversely affect our operating results 

we may use our fiveyear 2 billion revolving credit facility which backs our commercial paper program to meet our cash needs to the extent available as of december 31 2015 we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the facility and 323 million outstanding under our commercial paper program leaving an unused and available credit capacity of 1631 million we may also meet our cash needs by selling receivables under our 900 million us accounts receivable securitization facility or our €450 million european accounts receivable securitization facility in the event of a default under our credit facility or any of our senior notes we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do any default under any of our credit arrangements could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate 

legislation and regulatory initiatives could lead to a decrease in demand for our products 

new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health safety and the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products initiatives by governments and private interest groups will potentially require increased toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us for example in the united states the national toxicology program “ntp” is a federal interagency program that seeks to identify and select for study chemicals and other substances to evaluate potential human health hazards in the european union the regulation on registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals “reach” is regulation designed to identify the intrinsic properties of chemical substances assess hazards and risks of the substances and identify and implement the risk management measures to protect humans and the environment 

assessments under ntp reach or similar programs or regulations in other jurisdictions may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals we use or produce and may result in additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of those chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

adverse results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us 

we are subject to and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty irrespective of its merits litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expenditure and diversion of management attention we may be faced with significant monetary 

  

damages or injunctive relief against us that could materially adversely affect a portion of our business operations or materially and adversely affect our financial position and our results of operations should we fail to prevail in certain matters 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may adversely affect the valuation of pension obligations the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets may result in corresponding increases and decreases in the value of plan assets particularly equity securities or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets any change in key actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate would impact the valuation of pension obligations affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years 

certain of our current pension plans could have projected benefit obligations that exceed the fair value of the plan assets as of december 31 2015 the aggregate deficit was 871 million any declines in the fair values of the pension plans assets could require additional payments by us in order to maintain specified funding levels 

our pension plans are subject to legislative and regulatory requirements of applicable jurisdictions which could include under certain circumstances local governmental authority to terminate the plan

 intellectual property 

we maintain an extensive patent portfolio and continue to file new patent applications in the us and other countries as of december 31 2015 we owned approximately 5200 patents and patent applications worldwide our patents and trade secrets cover our processes products and catalysts and are significant to our competitive position particularly with regard to po intermediate chemicals petrochemicals polymers and our process technologies we own globally registered and unregistered trademarks including marks for “lyondellbasell” “lyondell” and “equistar” while we believe that our intellectual property provides competitive advantages we do not regard our businesses as being materially dependent upon any single patent trade secret or trademark some of our heritage production capacity operates under licenses from third parties 

environmental 

most of our operations are affected by national state regional and local environmental laws matters pertaining to the environment are discussed in part i item 1a risk factors  part i item 3 legal proceedings  part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation s and notes 2 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

we have made and intend to continue to make the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to environmental health and safety matters we incurred capital expenditures of 177 million in 2015 for health safety and environmental compliance purposes and improvement programs and estimate such expenditures to be approximately 291 million in 2016 and 408 million in 2017 

while capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance including compliance with potential legislation and potential regulation related to climate change cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe they will have a material effect on our competitive position 

while there can be no assurance that physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future we have reviewed the potential for these risks and have concluded that because of our facility locations and our existing distribution networks we do not believe these risks are material in the near term 

employee relations

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend environmental matters 

from time to time we and our joint ventures receive notices or inquiries from government entities regarding alleged violations of environmental laws and regulations pertaining to among other things the disposal emission and storage of chemical and petroleum substances including hazardous wastes item 103 of the sec’s regulation sk requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and the proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that we reasonably believe could exceed 100000 the matters below are disclosed solely pursuant to that requirement 

in september 2013 the louisiana department of environmental quality the “ldeq” issued a compliance order and notice of potential penalty to equistar chemicals lp pertaining to selfreported deviations arising from our lake charles louisiana polyolefins plant and relating to certain clean air act title v permit conditions limits and other requirements the matter involves deviations reported by us to the ldeq in semiannual reports covering 2007 through june 2011 we reasonably believe that ldeq may assert an administrative penalty demand in this matter in excess of 100000 

in september 2013 epa region v issued a notice and finding of violation alleging violations at our morris illinois facility related to flaring activity the notice generally alleges failures to monitor steam usage and improper flare operations we reasonably believe that epa region v may assert a penalty demand in excess of 100000 

in june 2014 epa region v issued a notice and finding of violation alleging violations at our tuscola illinois facility related to flaring activity the notice generally alleges failure to conduct a valid performance test and improper flare operations we reasonably believe that epa region v may assert a penalty demand in excess of 100000 

  

in july 2015 the texas commission on environmental quality “tceq” issued a proposed agreed order to houston refining lp pertaining to a clean air act title v air permit inspection covering the years 2013 and 2014 tceq has asserted an administrative penalty demand for this matter of 118127 and we are currently awaiting the approval of the agreed order by the tceq commissioners 

also in july 2015 the tceq issued a proposed agreed order to houston refining lp pertaining to an emissions event which occurred in august 2014 tceq has asserted an administrative penalty demand for this matter of 100000 which was approved by the commissioners in january 2016

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend general 

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes elsewhere in this report when we use the terms “we” “us” “our” or similar words in this discussion unless the context otherwise requires we are referring to lyondellbasell industries nv and its consolidated subsidiaries 

references to industry benchmark prices or costs including the weighted average cost of ethylene production are generally to industry prices and costs from thirdparty consulting data references to industry benchmarks for refining and oxyfuels market margins are to industry prices reported by platts a reporting service of the mcgrawhill companies references to industry benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas are to bloomberg 

overview 

our performance is driven by among other things global economic conditions generally and their impact on demand for our products raw material and energy prices as well as industryspecific issues such as production capacity our businesses are generally subject to the cyclicality and volatility seen in the chemicals and refining industries 

during 2015 we generated record earnings our performance remained focused and steady despite the challenging environment of declining crude oil and natural gas prices the impact of lower oil prices which reduced the us cost advantage for olefins and tba products was offset by stronger polyolefins results in the us and europe and in other businesses such as styrene lower prices for crude oil and correlated products also led to significant lower of cost or market inventory valuation charges during the year we believe our performance indicates our capability to deliver strong results under a wide range of operating environments during 2015 we continued to execute and expand our strategic growth program with expansions of our ethylene and pp compounds capacities we also moved forward additional growth projects during the year 

significant items that affected 2015 results include 

 

  

  

  

  

 other noteworthy items during 2015 include the following 

 

  

  

  

   

results of operations for the periods discussed in these “results of operations” are presented in the table below 

 

 results of operations 

revenues —we had revenues of 32735 million in 2015 45608 million in 2014 and 44062 million in 2013 

2015 versus 2014— revenues decreased by 12873 million or 28 in 2015 compared to 2014 

the decline in prices for crude oil and other feedstocks during 2015 was the primary contributing factor for lower average sales prices which were responsible for 23 of the revenue decline in 2015 versus 2014 unfavorable translation impacts resulting from a significant decline in the eurous dollar exchange rate further reduced revenues by 5 during 2015 

sales volumes during 2015 were relatively unchanged from 2014 a decrease in sales due to lower crude processing rates in our refining segment was mostly offset by higher sales volumes for other products including us and european polyolefins in our op—americas and op—eai segments respectively and tba products acetyls and styrene in our id segment 

crude processing rates at our houston refinery were negatively impacted in 2015 primarily as a result of unplanned maintenance outages during the last part of the year strong 2015 demand for polyethylene and the completion of an expansionrelated turnaround at our matagorda texas facility in the first quarter of 2014 led to the higher us polyethylene sales volumes in 2015 european polyolefins sales volumes increased relative to 2014 on higher demand european polypropylene sales volumes also benefited from higher operating rates in 2015 tba product sales volumes benefited from among other things strong octane and gasoline demand and a tight market an increase in methanol sales volumes due to higher operating rates and increased feedstock supply led to the higher acetyls sales volumes increased operating rates and industry outages boosted sales volumes during 2015 for po  derivatives and eo and derivatives 

2014 versus 2013— revenues increased 1546 million or 4 in 2014 compared to 2013 

higher sales volumes for acetyls styrene po and derivatives and refined products which were offset in part by lower volumes for us olefins and eo and derivatives contributed to 4 higher revenues in 2014 compared to 2013 higher acetyls sales volumes in 2014 benefited from the restart of our methanol plant at channelview texas in december 2013 sales volumes for styrene improved in 2014 compared to 2013 which was affected by 

  

planned maintenance activities in the us and europe industry outages in europe and asia in 2014 led to higher volumes for po and derivatives an increase in sales volumes of refined products in 2014 reflects higher crude processing rates relative to 2013 which was negatively impacted by planned outages at our houston refinery sales volumes for us polyethylene were favorably affected by firm demand and the completion of an expansion and turnaround of our matagorda texas polyethylene facility these increases were offset in part by lower us olefin sales volumes as 2014 volumes were impacted by an expansionrelated turnaround at our la porte texas facility unplanned outages in 2014 resulted in lower eo and derivative volumes during that period 

in 2014 higher average sales prices for us polyethylene polypropylene “pp” pp compounds po and derivatives except butanediol “bdo” and vinyl acetate monomer “vam” were offset by lower average sales prices for european polyethylene butanediol oxyfuels c4 chemicals and refining products 

increased demand and industry supply issues in 2014 led to the increase in us polyethylene prices the improvements in polypropylene prices reflected more favorable market conditions in 2014 versus 2013 global industry constraints and limited regional supply led to increased prices for vam and all of our po and derivatives products except butanediol which declined due to excess industry capacity in asia and the middle east the lower average sales prices for oxyfuels in 2014 reflected the impact of lower brent crude oil and gasoline prices which was partially offset by a higher octane blending premium in 2014 the decline in c4 chemicals prices was driven by the lower energy profile while the average sales prices for refining products reflected the decline in crude oil prices during the fourth quarter of 2014 

cost of sales —cost of sales were 25683 million in 2015 38939 million in 2014 and 37940 million in 2013 

2015 versus 2014— cost of sales decreased by 13256 million in 2015 compared to 2014 

cost of sales in 2015 includes pretax charges totaling 548 million for noncash lcm inventory valuation adjustments in all of our segments except technology these adjustments were driven mainly by declines in the prices for crude oil ethylene propylene benzene and etbe during 2015 cost of sales also includes 35 million of amortization expense associated with the expiration of emission allowance credits in our refining and id segments cost of sales in 2014 included a 760 million charge related to an lcm inventory valuation adjustment driven by a decline in feedstock prices in our op—americas segment and a 52 million benefit in our op—eai segment associated with a settlement for certain existing and future environmental claims under a 2005 indemnification agreement 

the decrease in cost of sales in 2015 was primarily due to lower feedstock costs in 2015 the raw material costs for heavy liquids and natural gas liquids “ngls” used in our op—americas segment naphtha and other feedstocks and propylene used in our op—eai segment benzene propylene butane ethylene and ethanol used in our id segment and crude oil used in our refining segment were significantly lower relative to 2014 

2014 versus 2013— cost of sales increased by 999 million in 2014 compared to 2013 noncash lcm charges related to inventories in all but our technology segment were responsible for 760 million of the 999 million increase in cost of sales these charges which were recognized in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 were primarily driven by declines in the prices of crude oil and products derived from or correlated to crude oil 

excluding these lcm adjustments cost of sales increased 239 million in 2014 over 2013 primarily due to the impact of the higher sales volumes discussed above the volume impact was reduced by the lower cost of crude oil and by the lower cost of ethylene production in the us and europe in 2014 compared to 2013 

operating income —our operating income was 6122 million 5736 million and 5102 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

  

2015 versus 2014— operating income increased by 386 million in 2015 which includes the impact of the 548 million lcm inventory valuation adjustment and the emission credit allowances amortization discussed above 

absent the lcm inventory valuation adjustments in 2015 and 2014 the amortization associated with the expiration of emission credit allowances in 2015 and the benefit from the environmental settlement in 2014 operating income was higher by 261 million in 2015 compared to 2014 the improvement in results was primarily driven by the operations of our op—eai and refining segments the primary drivers of the improvement in operating income were higher margins that benefited from lower feedstock costs and improved supplydemand fundamentals in our european olefins and polyolefins businesses higher refining margins also contributed to the increases in operating income improvements in polyolefins margins in our op—americas segment added to these increases in 2015 however lower olefin margins in that segment primarily driven by lower ethylene prices more than offset the polyolefins margin benefit improved styrene and eo and derivatives margins in our id segment which also added to the improvement in operating income were substantially offset by lower margins for tba products and acetyls 

2014 versus 2013— operating income increased by 634 million in 2014 which includes the impact of the 760 million lcm inventory valuation adjustment discussed above this increase primarily reflects the impact of the higher sales volumes discussed above and margins that benefited from lower feedstock costs 

apart from the lcm adjustment margins were higher in 2014 across all businesses in our op—americas and op—eai segments for po and derivatives acetyls and oxyfuels in our id segment and for refining products in our refining segment these higher margins were offset in part by lower margins for c4 chemicals styrene and eo and derivatives in our id segment our higher margins generally reflected our lower cost of ethylene production and the lower cost of crude oil but in some cases were driven by average sales prices that increased relative to the related feedstock costs lower margins for styrene and eo and derivatives reflected lower average sales prices compounded by higher feedstock costs and the lower c4 chemicals margins are attributed to falling energy prices 

operating results for each of our business segments are reviewed further in the “segment analysis” section below 

interest expense —interest expense was 310 million in 2015 352 million in 2014 and 309 million in 2013 

2015 versus 2014— the decrease in interest expense in 2015 relative to 2014 was primarily due to favorable impacts of 85 million related to our fixedforfloating interest rate swaps and crosscurrency swaps this decrease was offset in part by higher interest charges related to the issuance of our 4875 guaranteed notes due 2044 in february 2014 and our 4625 senior notes due 2055 in march 2015 

2014 versus 2013— the increase in interest expense in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to interest related to the july 2013 issuances of our 4 guaranteed notes due 2023 and 525 guaranteed notes due 2043 and the february 2014 issuance of our 4875 guaranteed notes due 2044 these increases were partially offset by a 28 million net favorable adjustment related to our fixedforfloating interest rate swaps 

see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our fixedforfloating interest rate swaps and crosscurrency swaps 

income from equity investments —our income from equity investments was 339 million in 2015 257 million in 2014 and 203 million in 2013 

2015 versus 2014— our 2015 income from equity investments increased by 82 million over 2014 largely due to improved margins in certain joint ventures as a result of favorable market prices during 2015 and strong operating rates 

  

2014 versus 2013— income from equity investments increased by 54 million over 2013 this improvement includes higher margins for some of our joint ventures in the middle east europe and asia the impact of better operating rates at two of our joint ventures in asia and one of our joint ventures in the middle east that experienced significant unplanned maintenance in 2013 in 2014 an improved supply of feedstock at one our asian joint ventures also contributed to the higher operating rates relative to 2013 

income taxes —our effective income tax rates of 279 in 2015 270 in 2014 and 227 in 2013 resulted in tax provisions of 1730 million 1540 million and 1136 million respectively our effective income tax rate fluctuates based on among other factors changes in pretax income in countries with varying statutory tax rates the us domestic production activity deduction changes in valuation allowances changes in foreign exchange gainslosses the amount of exempt income and changes in unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions the company’s exempt income primarily includes interest income and equity earnings of joint ventures the interest income is earned by certain of our european subsidiaries through intercompany financings and is either untaxed or taxed at rates substantially lower than the us statutory rate the equity earnings are attributable to our joint ventures and these earnings when paid dividended to certain european subsidiaries are eligible for participation exemptions which exempt the dividend payments from all or portions of normal statutory income tax rates we currently anticipate the favorable treatment for the interest income and dividends to continue in the near term however this treatment is based on current law and tax rulings which could change the foreign exchange gainslosses have a permanent impact on our effective income tax rate that can cause unpredictable movement in our effective income tax rate we continue to maintain valuation allowances in various jurisdictions totaling 125 million which could impact our effective tax rate in the future 

2015— the 2015 effective income tax rate which was lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35 was favorably impacted by exempt income earnings in various countries with lower statutory tax rates notably in europe and the us domestic production activity deduction these favorable items were partially offset by the effects of us state and local income taxes 

2014— the 2014 effective income tax rate which was lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35 was favorably impacted by exempt income the us domestic production activity deduction foreign exchange losses and earnings in various countries with lower statutory tax rates notably in europe these favorable items were partially offset by the effects of us state and local income taxes 

2013 —the 2013 effective income tax rate which was lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35 was favorably impacted by the release of certain valuation allowances exempt income the us domestic production activity deduction and earnings in various countries with lower statutory tax rates notably in europe partially offset by the effects of us state and local taxes and foreign exchange gains in 2013 we released valuation allowances primarily associated with tax losses in our french tax group resulting in an overall benefit of 353 million 

for further information related to our income taxes see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

comprehensive income— we had comprehensive income of 4064 million in 2015 3052 million in 2014 and 4364 million in 2013 

2015 versus 2014— in 2015 comprehensive income increased on higher net income the reduction in actuarial losses related to our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized in 2015 the favorable impact of unrealized net changes in foreign currency translation adjustments and to a lesser extent the benefit of favorable financial derivative adjustments 

in 2015 and 2014 we recognized net actuarial losses of 8 million and 493 million respectively the 493 million net loss in the prior year was caused primarily by pension and other postretirement benefit discount rate decreases and mortality assumption changes in 2015 the 8 million net loss was primarily attributable to 133 million of actual asset return less than the expected return this loss was offset by gains due to 73 million of discount rate increases and 50 million of gains due to favorable liability experience and healthcare assumptions 

  

the predominant functional currency for our operations outside of the us is the euro relative to the us dollar the value of the euro decreased during 2015 and 2014 resulting in losses as reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income 

2014 versus 2013— comprehensive income decreased by 1312 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to foreign currency translation losses and actuarial losses related to our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that were recognized during the period these losses were offset in part by the increase in 2014 net income over 2013 the predominant functional currency for our operations outside of the us is the euro relative to the us dollar the value of the euro decreased in 2014 versus 2013 resulting in foreign currency translation losses which decreased comprehensive income by 958 million in 2014 we recognized net actuarial losses of 493 million which compares to a net actuarial gain of 411 million recognized in 2013 this 904 million decline in 2014 reflects 663 million related to discount rate assumption changes and other immaterial liability experience gains and losses and 241 million primarily related to actual asset return in excess of the expected return compared to 2013 

see “critical accounting policies” below and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the key assumptions included in calculating the discount rate and expected return on plan assets 

segment analysis 

we use earnings before interest income taxes and depreciation and amortization “ebitda” as our measure of profitability for segment reporting purposes this measure of segment operating results is used by our chief operating decision maker to assess the performance of and allocate resources to our operating segments intersegment eliminations and items that are not directly related or allocated to business operations are included in “other” for additional information related to our operating segments as well as a reconciliation of ebitda to its nearest generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” measure income from continuing operations before income taxes see note 22 segment and related information  to our consolidated financial statements 

  

our continuing operations are divided into five reportable segments op—americas op—eai id refining and technology the following tables reflect selected financial information for our reportable segments 

 

 olefins and polyolefins—americas segment 

overview —in calculating the impact of margin and volume on ebitda consistent with industry practice management offsets revenues and volumes related to ethylene coproducts against the cost to produce ethylene volume and price impacts of ethylene coproducts are reported in margin ethylene is a major building block of our olefins and polyolefins businesses and as such management assesses the performance of the segment based on ethylene sales volumes and prices and our internal cost of ethylene production 

2015 versus 2014— segment results were lower in 2015 primarily due to a decline in olefins results partially offset by improved polyolefin results relative to 2014 olefins results in 2015 reflect lower margins offset in part by higher sales volumes due partly to the completion of an 800 million pound ethylene expansion at our la porte texas facility in september 2014 the decrease in olefins margins was driven by the decline in us ethylene prices due to the impact of lower oil prices on global ethylene markets and increased us ethylene supply margin improvements and higher sales volumes in 2015 led to the increased polyethylene and polypropylene results over 2014 

margins in our olefins business in 2015 continued to benefit from lowcost ethylene produced from ngls in north america but to a lesser extent than in 2014 and 2013 the cost advantage for this ethylene compared to that produced from naphtha and other crude oilbased liquids in the rest of the world declined due to the lower crude oil prices in 2015 higher us polyethylene margins and volumes reflected continued strong global market conditions polypropylene margins expanded on significant strengthening of supplydemand balances 

  

prices for heavy liquids ngls and olefins have declined significantly since the third quarter of 2014 to levels that have not been seen in recent years these declines resulted in the recognition of the noncash lcm inventory adjustments totaling 279 million in 2014 discussed below volatility in the benchmark prices for heavy liquids and natural gas and certain correlated products particularly ethylene and propylene which continued during most of 2015 led to net noncash lcm inventory valuation adjustments totaling 548 million during 2015 

2014 versus 2013— segment results were higher in 2014 primarily due to improved polyethylene and olefins results and to a lesser extent better polypropylene margins margin improvements and an increase in 2014 sales volumes contributed to the improved polyethylene results over 2013 our 2014 olefins results reflected higher margins relative to 2013 offset in part by a decrease in sales volumes from the outage at our la porte texas facility prior to the completion of the ethylene expansion discussed above our segment results were negatively impacted by a 279 million noncash lcm inventory valuation adjustment most of which was recognized in the fourth quarter 

as mentioned above the significant decline in prices for heavy liquids ngls and olefins in december 2014 to levels lower than the carrying value of our related inventories as of december 31 2014 required us to record the lcm inventory valuation adjustment discussed above 

ethylene raw materials —benchmark crude oil and natural gas prices generally have been indicators of the level and direction of the movement of raw material and energy costs for ethylene and its coproducts in the op—americas segment ethylene and its coproducts are produced from two major raw material groups 

 

  

 although prices of these raw materials are generally related to crude oil and natural gas prices during specific periods the relationships among these materials and benchmarks may vary significantly in the us we have significant capability to change the mix of raw materials used in the production of ethylene and its coproducts to take advantage of the relative costs of heavy liquids and ngls 

production economics for the industry have favored ngls in recent years although the decline in oil prices significantly reduced the cost of ethylene produced from heavy liquids in 2015 ngl prices also declined and they continued to be preferred feedstocks approximately 90 of our us ethylene production was produced from ngls during the past three years 

  

the following table shows the average us benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas for the applicable periods as well as benchmark us sales prices for ethylene and propylene which we produce and sell or consume internally the table also shows the discounted us benchmark prices for certain polyethylene and polypropylene products these industry benchmark prices are third party estimates that are indicative of contract sales for some key product grades but do not necessarily describe price trends for our full olefins or polymers product mixes the benchmark weighted average cost of ethylene production which reflects credits for coproduct sales is based on a third party consultant’s estimated ratio of heavy liquid raw materials and ngls used in us ethylene production 

 

 the following table sets forth selected financial information for the op—americas segment including income from equity investments which is a component of ebitda 

 

 revenues —revenues decreased by 3984 million or 29 in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased by 859 million or 7 in 2014 compared to 2013 

2015 versus 2014— average sales prices declined for most products in 2015 resulting in a 31 revenue decrease compared to 2014 lower average olefin prices reflect the significant decline in prices for crude oil and correlated products relative to prices in 2014 the decline in average polyethylene and polypropylene sales prices followed the decline in the 2015 prices of their respective feedstocks ethylene and propylene 

these decreases in revenues were offset in part by an increase in sales volumes which gave rise to a 2 revenue increase in 2015 compared to 2014 ethylene sales volumes were higher due to increased production reflecting higher capacity following the completion of the expansionrelated turnaround at our la porte texas facility during 2014 and additional production related to less planned and unplanned downtime at our channelview texas facility polyethylene sales volumes improved in 2015 due to the completion of an expansionrelated turnaround at our matagorda texas facility in the first quarter of 2014 and continued healthy global demand polypropylene sales volumes which were limited by production in both years increased slightly in 2015 relative to 2014 

2014 versus 2013— the 859 million increase in revenues in 2014 was the result of an improvement in average sales prices and increased sales volumes which accounted for 6 and 1 respectively of the increase over 2013 average sales prices in 2014 increased across most products particularly polyethylene higher average polyethylene prices in 2014 reflected increased demand and industry supply issues in the ethylene and polyethylene markets average polypropylene prices also improved in 2014 reflecting a market environment that was more favorable than in 2013 

  

the increase in sales volumes in 2014 was primarily due to higher polyethylene sales volumes offset in part by a decrease in ethylene volumes the increase in polyethylene sales volumes reflected the completion of an expansionrelated turnaround at our matagorda texas facility in the early part of 2014 and strong industry demand firm market demand throughout 2014 also contributed to the increase in polyethylene sales volumes over 2013 ethylene volumes were negatively impacted by production constraints as a result of the turnaround at our la porte texas facility during 2014 polypropylene sales volumes were relatively unchanged between the 2014 and 2013 periods 

ebitda —ebitda decreased by 250 million or 6 in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased by 338 million or 9 in 2014 compared to 2013 

2015 versus 2014— the 6 decrease in ebitda reflects a 24 net margin decline due to lower olefin margins offset in part by a 14 increase related to higher volumes and a 3 increase related to the 119 million decline in the noncash charges related to the lcm inventory valuation adjustments discussed above improvements in our income from equity investments accounts for the remaining 1 increase in ebitda during 2015 

the impact of significantly lower ethylene margins in 2015 was offset in part by increases in polyethylene and polypropylene margins compared to 2014 olefin margins declined in 2015 as the average sales price of ethylene was driven down by the decline of naphtha feedstock prices which generally trend with crude oil prices and by improved market supply due to an improvement in industry operating rates and additional market capacity a decrease in our cost of ethylene production partially offset the impact of the decline in ethylene sales price in 2015 lessening the impact of lower margins during the year lower ngl and heavy liquids feedstock prices in 2015 outpaced the decline in selling prices of our coproducts which resulted in the decrease of our cost of ethylene production compared to the prior year 

polyethylene margins improved in 2015 as demand remained strong and decreases in the cost of ethylene feedstock more than offset lower average sales prices relative to 2014 polypropylene margins which increased in 2015 benefited from lower propylene feedstock costs which in part reflect the decline in crude oil prices and higher average sales prices relative to propylene driven by industry operating issues and increased demand 

sales volumes in 2015 increased as compared to the prior year as a result of downtime and expansionrelated activities in 2014 and the increased demand discussed above 

2014 versus 2013— the 9 improvement in ebitda during 2014 reflects a 19 increase related to higher margins which was offset in part by a 2 decrease related to volumes and an 8 decrease related to the 279 million lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment discussed above 

margins improved across all products especially for olefins and polyethylene the combination of higher ethylene sales prices discussed above the lower cost of ngls and heavy liquids and higher coproduct credits resulted in an improvement in olefins margins in 2014 compared to 2013 the increase in 2014 polyethylene margins reflect higher average sales prices as discussed above offset in part by increases in ethylene feedstock costs polypropylene margins also improved in 2014 due to the continued strength in pricing that carried over from late 2013 

the decrease in ebitda attributable to the lower volumes reflects a decline in olefins volumes which was partially offset by increased polyethylene volumes 

  

olefins and polyolefins—europe asia international segment 

overview 

2015 versus 2014— operating results in 2015 reflect improved results for our european polyolefins business and to a lesser extent higher results for our olefins business and better results for our joint ventures that are accounted for using the equity method polyethylene and polypropylene margins improved due to supply constraints as a result of several industry outages and the benefit of a lower price position compared to other regions resulting from the weakness in the euro an increase in 2015 sales volumes also contributed to the higher polyethylene and polypropylene results relative to 2014 olefins margins improved in 2015 as the lower cost of ethylene production which was driven by lower feedstock prices outpaced the decline in olefin product prices margins benefited for most of 2015 from a lag between declining feedstock costs and product prices turnaround activities at our münchsmünster germany facility and unplanned outages resulted in a decrease in olefins sales volumes in 2015 relative to 2014 

at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 lower feedstock and product prices resulted in market prices that were lower than the carrying value of our related inventories accordingly we recorded a 30 million noncash lcm inventory valuation charge related to our olefins and polyolefins businesses this compares to the 44 million noncash lcm inventory valuation charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 discussed below 

2014 versus 2013— operating results in 2014 reflect improved results for our olefins and european polyolefins businesses and to a lesser extent better results for our joint ventures that are accounted for using the equity method improvements in margins and operating rates which surpassed european average industry rates contributed to the higher olefins results in 2014 higher polyolefins results in 2014 reflected improved margins versus 2013 and increased polyethylene volumes although market conditions for european producers remained highly competitive the increase in european demand for polyolefins was consistent with the modest overall economic recovery that was evidenced in the region 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 the declining price of naphtha resulted in a market price lower than the carrying value of our related inventory necessitating the recognition of a 44 million noncash lcm inventory valuation charge related to our olefins business despite this charge our fourth quarter results remained consistent with our prior quarterly results during 2014 the fall of our product prices lagged behind the decline in feedstock prices throughout the latter part of 2014 

ethylene raw materials —in europe heavy liquids are the primary raw materials for our ethylene production in periods during 2015 not affected by turnaround activities we increased the consumption of feedstocks other than naphtha such as propane butane and condensates in our production process the prices for these other feedstocks have been subject to declines that were at times of the same or greater magnitude as the declines in the crude oil prices 

  

the following table shows the average western europe benchmark prices for brent crude oil for the applicable periods as well as benchmark western europe prices for ethylene and propylene which we produce and consume internally or purchase from unrelated suppliers and discounted prices for certain polyethylene and polypropylene products these industry benchmark prices are third party estimates that are indicative of contract sales for some key product grades but do not necessarily describe price trends for our full olefins or polymers product mixes 

 

 the following table sets forth selected financial information for the op—eai segment including income from equity investments which is a component of ebitda 

 

 revenues —revenues in 2015 decreased by 3627 million or 24 compared to 2014 and increased by 518 million or 4 in 2014 compared to 2013 

2015 versus 2014— the decline in 2015 revenues reflects decreases of 14 and 12 related to lower average sales prices and currency translation impacts respectively an increase in polyolefins volumes which was substantially offset by a decline in olefins volumes stemming from turnaround activities and unplanned outages was responsible for a 2 revenue increase in 2015 

in 2015 lower average sales prices for polypropylene and pp compounds were partially offset by higher average polyethylene prices decreases in feedstock costs in 2015 led to the decline in polypropylene and pp compounds sales prices compared to 2014 the increase in polyethylene prices in 2015 reflect strong spread increases over ethylene primarily in europe 

higher polyethylene sales volumes reflect an increase in demand for our high density polyethylene as well as higher operating rates in 2015 increased demand and an improvement in operating rates led to the increase in 2015 polypropylene sales volumes over 2014 sale volumes for pp compounds increased in 2015 due to higher demand in the automotive industry lower production from our crackers related to turnaround activities during 2015 resulted in the decrease in olefins sales volumes 

2014 versus 2013— the increase in 2014 revenues comprises a 2 increase related to higher sales volumes and a 2 increase from higher average sales prices improved operations of our crackers in 2014 versus 2013 resulted in higher output which led to increased olefins sales volumes higher polyethylene sales volumes reflect an increase in our low density polyethylene production capacity relative to 2013 due to operational issues during that time polypropylene sales volumes declined in 2014 largely due to lower output related to turnaround activities at one of our joint ventures during the first quarter of 2014 and the closure of our clyde production facility in australia in late 2013 

  

in 2014 improvements in the average sales prices for polypropylene and pp compounds were partially offset by a decline in average polyethylene prices increases in feedstock costs in 2014 led to the higher polypropylene and pp compounds sales prices compared to 2013 the lower polyethylene prices in 2014 reflected a decline in ethylene feedstock costs primarily in europe 

ebitda —ebitda increased by 459 million or 34 in 2015 compared to 2014 and by 527 million or 63 in 2014 compared to 2013 

2015 versus 2014— the 34 improvement in 2015 ebitda reflects a 42 increase related to margins a 4 increase related to higher volumes and an additional 4 increase stemming from improvements in income from our equity investments these increases were partially offset by a 13 decrease due to the translation of a weaker euro and a 3 decrease related to a net charge of 38 million discussed below in 2015 ebitda included a 30 million charge related to lcm adjustments driven by a decline in naphtha prices and polyolefins prices in 2014 ebitda included a 52 million benefit associated with a settlement for certain existing and future environmental claims under a 2005 indemnification agreement from an insurance settlement which was offset in part by a 44 million charge related to an lcm adjustment driven by a decline in naphtha prices 

the increase in 2015 results was mainly driven by better results for european polyolefins and olefins compared to 2014 polyethylene results improved during 2015 on higher spreads primarily due to a decline in ethylene feedstock costs and on increased sales volume as discussed above polypropylene results increased in 2015 over the corresponding prior year period due to margin improvements from higher spreads and increased volumes as discussed above higher olefins results reflect margin improvements partly offset by a decline in volumes due to turnaround activity improved olefin margins reflect midyear supply constraints due to industry outages the decline in naphtha feedstock prices during the second half of 2015 and increased consumption of advantaged feedstocks in the first half of 2015 

the higher contribution to our results by certain of our joint ventures which is reflected in income from equity investments in 2015 is mainly driven by improved margins compared to 2014 in certain joint ventures as a result of favorable market prices during 2015 and strong operating rates 

2014 versus 2013— the 63 improvement in 2014 ebitda included a 51 increase related to margins a 7 increase related to higher volumes and a 7 increase related to improvements in income from our equity investments these increases were partially offset by a 2 decrease related to a net charge of 17 million discussed below in 2014 ebitda included a 52 million benefit associated with a settlement for certain existing and future environmental claims under a 2005 indemnification agreement from an insurance settlement which was offset in part by a 44 million charge related to an lcm adjustment driven by a decline in naphtha prices in 2013 ebitda included a 25 million benefit from an insurance settlement related to the damage to our ldpe plant described below 

the increase in 2014 results was mainly driven by improvements in earnings for olefins and european polyolefins compared to 2013 higher olefins results reflect margin improvements and the impact of increased volumes discussed above olefin margins improved primarily due to the combination of the decline in naphtha feedstock prices during the second half of 2014 higher consumption of advantaged feedstocks and increased propylene sales prices driven by tightness in the european market polyethylene results improved during 2014 on increased sales volume as discussed above and on higher spreads primarily due to a decline in ethylene feedstock costs polypropylene results increased in 2014 over the corresponding prior year period as the margin improvements from higher spreads more than offset the impact of the decline in volumes discussed above 

the higher contribution to our results by certain of our joint ventures which is reflected in income from equity investments in 2014 is mainly driven by improved margins compared to 2013 as a result of favorable market price developments during 2014 

  

intermediates and derivatives segment 

overview 

2015 versus 2014 —results in 2015 reflect improvements in our styrene business and to a lesser extent our ethylene oxide and derivatives business offset in part by lower results for our oxyfuels and c4 chemicals “tba products” and acetyls businesses stronger margins resulting from favorable product pricing and declining benzene and ethylene feedstock costs led to the improved styrene results the decline in the 2015 results for acetyls and tba products reflected a decrease in methanol prices due to increased industry supply and lower energy prices respectively compared to 2014 which reflected unusually high tba product margins 

our 2015 results were also unfavorably impacted by noncash lcm inventory valuation adjustments the continued decline in benzene etbe and feedstock prices to levels that were lower than the carrying value of our related inventories at reporting dates throughout the year necessitated the recognition of 181 million of lcm inventory valuation adjustments in 2015 an 88 million increase over the lcm inventory valuation adjustment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 

although 2015 results were strong fourth quarter results reflected a considerable decline versus those achieved in the third quarter typical seasonal declines in demand planned and unplanned outages and a 74 million noncash lcm inventory valuation adjustment recognized in the fourth quarter led the decline in fourth quarter results 

2014 versus 2013 —operating results for our id segment reflected a slight decline in 2014 compared to 2013 due to a 93 million noncash lcm inventory valuation adjustment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 this adjustment was a result of the decline of prices for oxyfuels and the raw materials used to produce oxyfuels that fell to levels that were lower than the carrying value of our related inventories at december 31 2014 

absent this inventory valuation adjustment results reflected improvements in acetyls and po and derivatives that were offset in part by lower results for styrene ethylene oxideethylene glycol “eoeg” and the tba chains the increase in acetyls results was primarily driven by the restart of the channelview texas methanol unit in december 2013 industry outages and the delay of announced capacity additions contributed to the improvement in po and derivatives results in 2014 in 2014 styrene results fell below 2013 results due to excess supply and higher feedstock prices compared to 2013 unplanned maintenance in the last half of the year contributed to the decrease in our eoeg results in 2014 the decrease in our tba chain results reflected the impact of lower oxyfuels sales volumes that was partially offset by slightly better margins 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the id segment including income from equity investments which is a component of ebitda in addition the table shows methyl tertiary butyl ether “mtbe” margins in northwest europe “nwe” 

 

 revenues —revenues for 2015 decreased by 2358 million or 23 compared to 2014 and increased by 658 million or 7 in 2014 compared to 2013 

  

2015 versus 2014— the decrease in 2015 revenues reflects a decline in average sales prices for most products and a significantly weaker euro against the us dollar partly offset by higher sales volumes relative to the prior year the declines in average sales prices and the currency translation impacts led to revenue decreases of 23 and 6 respectively these negative impacts were reduced by a 6 revenue increase related to higher sales volumes for our tba acetyls po and derivatives styrene and eo and derivatives businesses 

in 2015 the significant decline in crude oil and other key feedstocks prices was the primary driver behind the overall decrease in average sales prices across most businesses the impact of industry supply constraints in several businesses principally styrene and eoeg due to planned and unplanned outages slowed the impact of falling prices however average sales prices fell below 2014 levels this decline in prices was offset in part by tba product octane blend premiums and gasoline price spreads over crude oil that were strong in 2015 

tba product sales volumes increased due to strong octane and gasoline demand higher sales of purchased material and the reduction of inventory levels also contributed to this increase in sales volumes increased feedstock supply and an improvement in operating rates led to the increase in 2015 methanol sales volumes operating rates were higher in 2015 despite planned outages at our channelview texas posm plant and our po  tba plant at fos sur mer france these higher operating rates which reflected strong global demand and the impact of industry outages led to an increase in po  derivatives and styrene sales volumes industry outage and higher operating rates contributed to the increased sales volumes for eo and derivatives 

2014 versus 2013— sales volumes and average sales prices increased revenues by 6 and 1 respectively in 2014 compared to 2013 

higher sales volumes for acetyls styrene and po were offset in part by a decline in eo and derivatives and oxyfuels sales volumes the 2014 increase in acetyls sales volumes was mainly driven by the december 2013 restart of our methanol plant in channelview texas sales volumes for styrene were higher in 2014 as volumes in 2013 were negatively impacted by planned plant outages at our channelview texas and maasvlakte the netherlands facilities which limited production capacity during that period po sales volumes increased in 2015 largely due to industry outages in asia and europe in 2014 due to unplanned outages at our bayport texas facility in 2014 available production capacity was limited which resulted in lower eo derivatives volumes compared to 2013 planned and unplanned production constraints in 2014 were also responsible for lower oxyfuels volumes compared to 2013 

in 2014 higher average sales prices for po and derivatives and vam were partially offset by declines in the average sales prices for oxyfuels and c4 chemicals in 2014 compared to 2013 global industry supply constraints and limited regional supply capacity led to higher prices for po and derivatives as well as vam in 2014 compared 2013 tba product sales prices declined in 2014 relative to 2013 with lower crude oil and gasoline prices which were partially mitigated by an increase in the octane blend premium octane blend premiums remained strong in 2014 primarily due to industry supply constraints and regionally strong blending demand 

ebitda —ebitda increased by 16 million or 1 in 2015 compared to 2014 and decreased by 33 million or 2 in 2014 compared to 2013 

2015 versus 2014— the 1 increase in ebitda during 2015 reflects increases of 7 related to higher volumes and 1 related to improvements in income from our equity investments these improvements were substantially offset by decreases of 6 related to the 88 million incremental increase in the noncash lcm inventory valuation adjustment recognized in 2015 over 2014 and by a 1 decrease related to lower margins in 2015 

segment results in 2015 reflect better results for styrene and eo and derivatives partly offset by lower results for our tba chain and acetyls 

  

higher styrene results in 2015 reflect significant margin improvements driven by tight supply resulting from industry outages and by benzene and ethylene feedstock prices that declined more rapidly than the average sales price of styrene results also benefited from increased sales volumes stemming from stronger market demand industry outages and higher operating rates compared to 2014 

ethylene oxide and derivative results were higher in 2015 relative to 2014 reflecting margin improvements and increased sales volumes despite a decline in product prices margins improved as the ethylene feedstock prices declined more rapidly than the decline in average sales prices ethylene oxide volumes increased in 2015 compared to 2014 which was negatively impacted by constrained production due to turnaround activities 

results for the tba chain declined in 2015 reflecting lower margins offset in part by an increase in sales volumes as discussed above a significant decline in crude oil prices which was partly offset by strong gasoline price spreads over crude oil and octane blending value led to a decrease in tba product margins 

acetyls results declined in 2015 relative to 2014 as lower margins were offset in part by increased sales volumes despite turnaround activities at our la porte texas facility in the latter part of the year the decrease in acetyls margins reflects a decline of methanol prices due to new industry supply and falling energy prices partially offset by lower natural gas prices 

2014 versus 2013— ebitda decreased in 2014 as a result of the 93 million lcm inventory valuation adjustment in 2014 related to our oxyfuels business which represented a 6 decrease in ebitda compared to 2013 the impact of this charge was offset in part by a 2 increase in ebitda related to 2013 charges totaling 26 million associated with the sale of our investment in nihon oxirane company discussed below in addition to these items a 10 increase in ebitda related to higher volumes was offset in part by a decrease of 8 related to lower margins 

apart from the onetime items discussed above our 2014 results reflected improvements in po and derivatives and acetyls partially offset by lower results for oxyfuels c4 chemicals styrene and eoeg compared to 2013 

improved po and derivatives results for 2014 benefitted from asian startup delays industry outages and european industry supply interruptions these global factors collectively led to higher po sales volumes and increases in average sales prices in 2014 compared to 2013 in addition po and derivatives particularly propylene glycols benefited from the unusually cold weather in early 2014 compared to 2013 

higher acetyls results in 2014 predominantly reflected higher methanol volumes due to the restart of our methanol plant in channelview texas in december 2013 combined with improved vam driven by industry outages and a reduction in overall market supply compared to 2013 although operational issues during 2014 limited the benefit derived from the restart of our methanol plant discussed above the plant added approximately 180 million gallons to the overall results during that period improved vam margins in 2014 as increases in average sales prices were partly offset by higher feedstock costs also contributed to the higher acetyls results compared to 2013 

the lower oxyfuels results were mostly due to decreases in sales volumes in 2014 as a result of planned and unplanned outages discussed above margins improved moderately in 2014 compared to 2013 as lower brent crude oil and gasoline prices were more than offset by the improved spread between gasoline and crude oil stronger octane blend premiums and lower feedstock prices margins were also negatively impacted by a shift in the level of sales between regions in addition c4 chemicals results declined on falling energy prices 

the decline in styrene results in 2014 compared to 2013 was attributed to lower margins that were partially offset by the impact of the increase in sales volumes discussed above styrene margins decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower average sales prices reflecting weak demand and excess capacity and higher benzene and ethylene feedstock prices 

  

eoeg results in 2014 declined on lower margins and decreases in sales volumes relative to 2013 

refining segment 

overview —the refining segment comprises the operations of our full conversion refinery located on the houston ship channel in houston texas 

2015 versus 2014— the results of our refining segment in 2015 were impacted by noncash charges totaling 177 million related to lcm inventory valuation adjustments to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to market value at our third and fourth quarter reporting dates these charges which resulted from a near 20 barrel decline in crude oil prices since the end of 2014 and corresponding reductions in refined product prices were 167 million less than the lcm inventory valuation adjustment recorded in 2014 

fourth quarter 2015 results declined significantly compared to the results in the prior three quarters of 2015 as refinery operating rates were significantly lower due to unplanned maintenance outages the recognition of a 127 million noncash lcm inventory valuation adjustment resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter 

excluding the impacts of the lcm inventory valuation adjustments recognized in both years segment results for 2015 increased over 2014 as improvements in refining margins were largely driven by higher byproduct price spreads over crude oil due to the drop in crude oil prices and increased purchases of crude oil at advantaged prices 

2014 versus 2013— the results of our refining segment in 2014 were significantly impacted by a yearend noncash charge of 344 million to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to market value at december 31 2014 this inventory valuation charge was predicated on a near 50 per barrel decline in crude oil prices since the third quarter of 2014 and corresponding reductions in refined product prices 

fourth quarter 2014 results were markedly lower than results in the prior three quarters of 2014 as refined product margins contracted and the recognition of the lcm inventory valuation adjustment resulted in a loss for the quarter excluding this charge 2014 segment ebitda reflected an increase over 2013 as refining margins improved operating rates were higher and costs for renewable identification numbers a us government established credit used to show compliance in meeting the environmental protection agency’s renewable fuel standard declined by 20 million 

the following table sets forth selected financial information and heavy crude processing rates for the refining segment and the us refining market margins for the applicable periods “lls” is a light crude oil while “maya” is a heavy crude oil 

 

 revenues —revenues decreased by 5153 million or 44 in 2015 compared to 2014 and were nearly unchanged in 2014 compared to 2013 

  

2015 versus 2014— total revenues decreased on significantly lower product prices due to the drop in crude oil prices and a reduction in sales volumes due to production limitations the average crude oil price in 2015 declined by slightly over 40 per barrel compared to 2014 leading to lower product pricing this decline in product pricing caused a 38 decrease in revenues compared to 2014 processing rates in 2015 reflect an 8 decrease from 2014 rates driven by processing limits which were negatively impacted primarily by unplanned maintenance in the fourth quarter of 2015 this decline contributed to a 6 decrease in 2015 revenues 

2014 versus 2013— the increase in total revenues reflected increased sales volume which were nearly offset by lower product prices sales volumes increased 8 in 2014 relative to 2013 on the benefit of near capacity crude processing rates during most of the year processing rates in 2014 reflect a 12 improvement over rates in 2013 which were negatively impacted by planned and unplanned maintenance this increase was offset by a nearly 8 decrease in revenues driven by lower refined product prices attributable to a drop in crude oil prices in 2014 

ebitda —ebitda increased by 277 million or 426 in 2015 compared to 2014 and decreased by 117 million or 64 in 2014 compared to 2013 

2015 versus 2014— the 177 million lcm inventory valuation adjustment in 2015 was significantly less than the 344 million adjustment recorded in 2014 this change in the lcm inventory valuation adjustment increased ebitda by 257 results also improved by an additional 283 in 2015 due to an increase in refining margins these improvements were offset in part by a 114 decline due to lower processing rates 

the increase in refining margins in 2015 relative to 2014 was generated by improved byproduct price spreads to crude oil and increased purchases of crude oil at advantaged prices relative to the maya crude price benchmark byproduct spreads improved due to a decline in 2015 of the average per barrel price of crude oil relative to 2014 these factors more than offset the decline in the maya 211 benchmark margin in 2015 versus 2014 

crude processing rates in 2015 reflect an 8 decline relative to 2014 this decline is mainly due to a number of unplanned outages for maintenance that began in the latter part of the third quarter and extended into early december the average crude processing rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 206 thousands of barrels per day processing rates returned to near full capacity by middecember 2015 

2014 versus 2013— the 344 million lcm inventory valuation adjustment in 2014 represented a 189 decrease in ebitda during the period ebitda was lower in 2014 relative to 2013 by an additional 7 due to a 14 million onetime recovery and settlement in 2013 discussed below in addition to these items our results reflected higher refining margins and higher volumes in 2014 which resulted in increases in ebitda of 98 and 34 respectively 

higher refining margins in 2014 compared to 2013 were generated by improved average differentials between light and heavy crude oils an increase in spreads between gasoline and diesel products versus light crude improved byproduct price spreads to crude oil cost and a decrease in the cost for rins 

refinery crude oil processing rates in 2014 were maintained near capacity with the exception of rates in the first quarter of 2014 processing rates in the first quarter of 2014 were negatively impacted by temporary reductions in coking capacity due to the repair of equipment necessitated by operational issues experienced in december 2013 planned repairs on a process vessel in april 2014 also resulted in reduced crude processing during that time 

  

technology segment 

overview —the technology segment recognizes revenues related to the sale of polyolefin catalysts licensing of chemical polyolefin and other process technologies and associated engineering and other services these revenues are offset in part by the costs incurred in the production of catalysts licensing and services activities and in research and development “rd” activities in 2015 our technology segment incurred approximately 55 of all rd costs while in the corresponding periods of 2014 and 2013 it incurred approximately 65 and 70 respectively of our rd costs 

2015 versus 2014— ebitda in 2015 was relatively unchanged compared to 2014 reflecting improved catalyst results and lower rd expenses offset by lower licensing and services revenues 

2014 versus 2013— ebitda in 2014 was unchanged compared to 2013 reflecting lower rd expenses and to a lesser extent higher catalyst results offset by lower licensing and services revenues 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the technology segment 

 

 revenues —revenues decreased by 32 million or 6 in 2015 compared to 2014 and by 35 million or 7 in 2014 compared to 2013 

2015 versus 2014— the unfavorable currency translation impacts due to the significantly weaker euro versus the us dollar and a decline in licensing and services revenues contributed 12 and 7 to the decrease in 2015 revenues these declines were offset in part by revenue increases of 12 and 1 respectively related to higher catalyst sales volumes and higher average catalyst sales prices in 2015 

2014 versus 2013— lower licensing and services revenues contributed 7 to the decrease in revenues in 2014 compared to 2013 which benefited from the onetime lumpsum settlement associated with a process license agreement entered into in a prior year higher average catalyst sales prices increased revenues by 1 in 2014 while catalyst sales volumes reflected a corresponding decrease compared to the prior year period 

ebitda —ebitda in 2015 increased by 11 million or 5 compared to 2014 and remained unchanged in 2014 compared to 2013 

2015 versus 2014— ebitda increased by 11 million or 5 in 2015 compared to 2014 as improved catalyst volumes and margins were partly offset by unfavorable currency translation impacts and lower r d expenses were more than offset by lower licensing and services revenues 

2014 versus 2013— ebitda in 2014 reflects lower rd expenses and moderately higher catalyst results offset by lower licensing and services revenues as discussed above the improvement in 2014 catalyst results over 2013 was the result of higher margins due to higher average sales prices and lower cost 

  

financial condition 

operating investing and financing activities of continuing operations which are discussed below are presented in the following table 

 

 operating activities —cash of 5842 million generated in 2015 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items offset in part by cash used by the main components of working capital—accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable 

the main components of working capital consumed cash of 246 million in 2015 total cash used by the 786 million decrease in accounts payable and the 240 million increase in inventories was offset in part by a 780 million decline in accounts receivable the decline in 2015 accounts payable reflects the lower cost of crude oil and other feedstocks an increase in the levels of our us olefins and crude oil inventories at year end led to the increase in 2015 inventories us olefins inventories increased in preparation for the turnaround at our corpus christi texas facility in 2016 while the unplanned maintenance outage at our houston refinery resulted in the higher level of crude oil inventories at year end accounts receivable decreased on lower average product sales prices reflective of the drop in 2015 crude oil prices 

cash of 6048 million generated in 2014 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items distributions from our joint ventures and refunds totaling 232 million for value added taxes “vat” related to prior periods that were received from italian tax authorities in 2014 these cash inflows were offset in part by cash used by the main components of working capital—accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable 

the main components of working capital used cash of 225 million in 2014 total cash used by the 205 million increase in inventories and by the 378 million decrease in accounts payable was offset in part by a 358 million decline in accounts receivable the increase in inventories primarily reflects higher olefins raw material inventories which were offset in part by lower ethylene and propylene inventories due to turnaround activities at our la porte texas facility and higher levels of inventory for crude oil and workinprocess in our refining segment accounts payable decreased due to lower feedstock costs in 2014 compared to 2013 the decrease in accounts receivable primarily reflects lower ethylene prices in our op—eai segment lower oxyfuels prices in our id segment lower average sales prices and year end volumes in north american polyolefins and lower prices for refining products also contributing to the decline was a larger than usual accounts receivable balance at the end of 2013 attributable to customer remittance timing 

cash of 4835 million generated in 2013 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items proceeds received from italian tax authorities for refunds of vat from prior periods distributions from our joint ventures insurance settlements and cash provided by the main components of working capital these increases were offset in part by company contributions to our pension plans 

the main components of working capital generated cash of 60 million in 2013 this reflected increases of 64 million 151 million and 275 million in accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable respectively the increase in inventories was attributable to a build in our op—americas polyethylene inventory at the end of 2013 in preparation for a turnaround scheduled during the first half of 2014 at our la porte texas facility and an increase in crude inventory levels over 2012 levels these increases were partially offset by decreases in our id segment inventories the increase in accounts receivable reflected higher year 

  

end op—americas and id segment sales volumes in 2013 compared to 2012 a temporary increase in the purchase of intermediate feedstocks due to operating issues at the houston refinery at the end of 2013 and an increase in payment terms for crude oil purchases in our refining segment were the primary drivers for the increase in accounts payable 

investing activities —we invested cash of 1051 million 3531 million and 1602 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

in 2014 we began to invest cash in investmentgrade and other highquality financial instruments that provide flexibility to redeploy funds as needed to meet our cash flow requirements while maximizing yield in 2015 and 2014 we invested 2073 million and 3439 million respectively in securities that are deemed availableforsale and classified as shortterm investments we also invested 397 million and 425 million in triparty repurchase agreements in 2015 and 2014 respectively these investments are classified as shortterm loans receivable except for a 101 million investment made during 2015 which is classified as a longterm loan receivable we also received proceeds upon the sale and maturity of certain of our availableforsale securities and repurchase agreement of 2489 million and 350 million respectively in 2015 and 1751 million and 75 million respectively in 2014 see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these investments 

the following table summarizes our capital expenditures plan for 2016 and actual capital expenditures for our continuing operations for the periods from 2013 through 2015 

 

 the amounts presented for the 2016 plan above include our contributions to our po joint venture assets 

capital spending projected for 2016 is expected to increase over 2015 levels the largest projected increase is for our op—americas segment and includes spending for projects related to environmental health and safety matters the ethylene expansion and related turnaround of our corpus christi texas facility turnaround activities at one of our polyethylene facilities the purchase of railcars and other projects spending in 2016 is also projected to be higher for our refining and op—eai segments versus 2015 spending for the op—eai segment is expected to increase as a result of turnaround activities at two of our facilities increased spending is planned for the refining segment in 2016 as certain capital maintenance and turnaround projects scheduled in 2015 were deferred until 2016 during the strike at our houston refinery this increased level of spending is offset in part by lower projected spending in 2016 related to turnaround activities for our id segment as compared to 2015 

the decreased level of 2015 spending versus 2014 for our op—americas segment reflects the completion in 2014 of the ethylene expansion and associated turnaround at our la porte texas facility a debottleneck at our corpus christi texas facility and the installation of new furnaces at our channelview texas facility turnaround activities at four of our us and european facilities resulted in an increase in 2015 capital spending over 2014 the completion of the 2014 op—americas segment projects mentioned above are reflected in the 

  

increase in 2014 capital spending relative to 2013 this increase was offset in part by reduced capital spending for our id refining and op—eai segments in 2014 relative to 2013 due primarily to the completion in 2013 of the restart of our methanol plant in channelview texas a major turnaround at our houston texas refinery and a butadiene expansion project in wesseling germany respectively

for additional information related to our credit facilities and notes discussed above see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

in may 2015 our shareholders approved a proposal to authorize us to repurchase up to an additional 10 or approximately 47 million of our shares outstanding over the next eighteen months our share repurchase program does not have a stated dollar amount and purchases may be made through open market purchases private market transactions or other structured transactions repurchased shares could be retired or used for general corporate purposes including for various employee benefit and compensation plans as of december 31 2015 we have purchased 32 million shares under this program for approximately 2896 million as of february 11 2016 we had approximately 7million shares remaining under the current authorization the timing and amount of additional shares repurchased will be determined by our management board based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors for additional information related to our share repurchase programs see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

on february 5 2016 we received proceeds of 184 million from the sale of our wholly owned subsidiary petroken petroquimica ensenada sa 

we may repay or redeem our debt including purchases of our outstanding bonds in the open market using cash on hand cash from operating activities proceeds from the issuance of debt proceeds from asset divestitures or a combination thereof we plan to fund our ongoing working capital capital expenditures debt service and other funding requirements with cash from operations which could be affected by general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory business and other factors many of which are beyond our control cash on hand cash from operating activities proceeds from the issuance of debt or a combination thereof may be used to fund the repurchase of shares under our share repurchase program 

we intend to continue to declare and pay quarterly dividends with the goal of increasing the dividend over time after giving consideration to our cash balances and expected results from operations 

  

we believe that our cash on hand cash from operating activities and proceeds from our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due 

contractual and other obligations —the following table summarizes as of december 31 2015 our minimum payments for longterm debt including current maturities shortterm debt and contractual and other obligations for the next five years and thereafter 

 

 total debt —our debt includes unsecured senior notes guaranteed notes and various other us and nonus loans see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of covenant requirements under the credit facilities and indentures and additional information regarding our debt facilities 

interest on total debt —our debt and related party debt agreements contain provisions for the payment of monthly quarterly or semiannual interest at a stated rate of interest over the term of the debt 

pension and other postretirement benefits —we maintain several defined benefit pension plans as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements many of our us and nonus plans are subject to minimum funding requirements however the amounts of required future contributions for all our plans are not fixed and can vary significantly due to changes in economic assumptions liability experience and investment return on plan assets as a result we have excluded pension and other postretirement benefit obligations from the contractual and other obligations table above our annual contributions may include amounts in excess of minimum required funding levels contributions to our nonus plans in years beyond 2016 are not expected to be materially different than the expected 2016 contributions disclosed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2015 the projected benefit obligation for our pension plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by 871 million subject to future actuarial gains and losses as well as actual asset earnings we together with our consolidated subsidiaries will be required to fund the 871 million with interest in future years we contributed 107 million 94 million and 172 million to our pension plans in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively we provide other postretirement benefits primarily medical benefits to eligible participants as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements we pay other unfunded postretirement benefits as incurred 

advances from customers —we are obligated to deliver products in connection with longterm sales agreements under which advances from customers were received in prior years these advances are treated as deferred revenue and will be amortized to earnings as product is delivered over the remaining terms of the respective contracts which range predominantly from 4 to 8 years the unamortized longterm portion of such advances totaled 40 million as of december 31 2015 

  

other —other primarily consists of accruals for environmental remediation costs obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and anticipated asset retirement obligations see “critical accounting policies” below for a discussion of obligations for environmental remediation costs 

deferred income taxes —the scheduled settlement of the deferred tax liabilities shown in the table is based on the scheduled reversal of the underlying temporary differences actual cash tax payments will vary depending upon future taxable income see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our deferred tax liabilities 

purchase obligations —we are party to various obligations to purchase products and services principally for raw materials utilities and industrial gases these commitments are designed to assure sources of supply and are not expected to be in excess of normal requirements the commitments are segregated into takeorpay contracts and other contracts under the takeorpay contracts we are obligated to make minimum payments whether or not we take the product or service other contracts include contracts that specify minimum quantities however in the event that we do not take the contractual minimum we are only obligated for any resulting economic loss suffered by the vendor the payments shown for the other contracts assume that minimum quantities are purchased for contracts with variable pricing terms the minimum payments reflect the contract price at december 31 2015 

operating leases —we lease various facilities and equipment under noncancelable lease arrangements for various periods see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for related lease disclosures 

current business outlook 

the decline in crude oil prices has continued into the early part of 2016 in our op—americas and op—eai segments ethylene prices have trended down with crude oil and in op—americas with increased ethylene supplies due to high industry operating rates as a result the ethylene margin for op—americas is expected to be lower on an ngl feedstock basis whereas op—eai should be able to hold and possibly grow the ethylene margin on a naphtha feedstock basis polyolefins margins in the us and europe are expected to remain healthy in north america polypropylene margins are being supported by a tight market and falling monomer prices could continue to support polyolefins margins in europe during the first quarter we will commence a turnaround at our berre france cracker which is expected to impact first quarter results by 20 million in our op—eai segment 

thus far our id segment has seen stable demand in the propylene oxide market however the restart of competitor plants impacted by outages may impact global product balances strong gasoline prices and octane premiums partially offset the negative impacts of lower crude oil prices and seasonally higher butane prices on oxyfuels margins additional capacity that has entered the market is putting downward pressure on our methanol margins 

although our refining segment expects to benefit from an improved maya 211 spread stemming from higher gasoline margins planned maintenance on a crude unit and coker at our houston refinery which is currently underway is expected to have a 40 million negative impact on first quarter results as a result of these maintenance activities first quarter crude processing rates are expected to be similar to fourth quarter 2015 rates 

related party transactions 

we have related party transactions with a major shareholder and its affiliates and our joint venture partners we believe that such transactions are effected on terms substantially no more or less favorable than those that would have been agreed upon by unrelated parties on an arm’s length basis see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional related party disclosures 

  

critical accounting policies 

management applies those accounting policies that it believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the us see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements our more critical accounting policies include those related to the valuation of inventory longlived assets the valuation of goodwill accruals for longterm employee benefit costs such as pension and other postretirement costs and accruals for taxes based on income inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management management periodically updates its estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment 

inventory —we account for our inventory using the lastin firstout “lifo” method of accounting 

the cost of raw materials which represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses and energy costs generally follow price trends for crude oil andor natural gas crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to many factors including changes in economic conditions fluctuation in the prices of crude oil and natural gas from period to period may result in the recognition of charges to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in periods of falling prices and the reversal of those charges in subsequent interim periods as market prices recover accordingly our cost of sales and results of operations may be affected by such fluctuations 

on may 1 2010 upon emergence from bankruptcy we recorded our inventory which is primarily crude oil and correlated products derived therefrom at fair value in accordance with the requirements of freshstart accounting the per barrel benchmark price of wti crude oil at that date was 8615 

during 2014 we recorded lcm inventory valuation adjustments totaling 760 million driven primarily by the decline in the price of crude oil and related declines in the prices of heavy liquids and other correlated products a 45 million charge was taken in the third quarter of 2014 which marked the beginning of the current downward price trend an additional 715 million of lcm inventory valuation adjustment was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 to reflect decreases of approximately 50 in the price indices for crude oil and other correlated products as compared to the third quarter of 2014 since our inventory consists of manufactured products derived from crude oil natural gas natural gas liquids and correlated materials as well as the associated feedstocks and intermediate chemicals our inventory market values are generally influenced by changes in benchmark crude oil and heavy liquid values and prices for manufactured finished goods the degree of influence of a particular benchmark may vary from period to period as the composition of the dollar value lifo pools change due to natural inventory composition changes variation in pricing from period to period does not necessarily result in a linear lcm impact additionally an lcm condition may arise due to a decline in a particular material that had previously provided a positive impact within a pool as a result market valuations and lcm conditions are dependent upon the composition and mix of materials on hand at the balance sheet date in the measurement of an lcm adjustment the numeric input value for determining the crude oil market price includes pricing that is weighted by volume of inventories held at a point in time including wti brent and maya crude oils at december 31 2014 representative prices for crude oil and heavy liquids were 4759 per barrel and 4520 per barrel respectively these price inputs were calculated using a weighted average of the materials held in inventory on that date 

the trend of falling hydrocarbon prices continued in 2015 leading to further lcm inventory valuation adjustments in 2015 the cumulative charge related to lcm inventory valuation adjustments which was driven by declines in crude oil ethylene propylene benzene and etbe was 548 million representative prices used in the calculation of the cumulative lcm inventory adjustments recognized in 2015 were 3022 per barrel for crude oil 20 cents per pound for ethylene 32 cents per pound for propylene 214 per gallon for benzene and 166 per gallon for etbe for additional information related to these lcm inventory adjustments see note 22 further sustained price declines in our finished goods and raw materials could result in additional lcm inventory valuation charges during 2016 

  

currently all but one of our lifo inventory pools are “atrisk” for further adjustment as each impacted lifo pool is at or approximates the calculated market value at the last balance sheet measurement date “atrisk” inventory accounts for 33 billion of our total inventory carrying value of 41 billion as of december 31 2015 the extent to which further adjustment may occur is dependent on pool specific product prices and composition within each individual dollar value lifo pool at the balance sheet date 

longlived assets —with respect to longlived assets which primarily include property plant and equipment and intangible assets key assumptions included estimates of useful lives and the recoverability of carrying values of fixed assets and other intangible assets as well as the existence of any obligations associated with the retirement of fixed assets such estimates could be significantly modified andor the carrying values of the assets could be impaired by such factors as new technological developments new chemical industry entrants with significant raw material or other cost advantages uncertainties associated with the european us and other world economies the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries and uncertainties associated with regulatory governmental actions 

when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we evaluate definite lived intangible assets for impairment longlived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets which for us is generally at the plant group level or at times individual plants in certain circumstances where we have isolated production units with separately identifiable cash flows when it is probable that the undiscounted cash flows of a tangible asset or asset group will not be sufficient to recover the carrying amount the asset is written down to its estimated fair value inprocess research and development projects are impaired when abandoned 

the estimated useful lives of longlived assets range from 3 to 30 years depreciation and amortization of these assets including amortization of capitalized plant turnaround costs under the straightline method over their estimated useful lives totaled 1047 million in 2015 the useful lives of assets are assessed periodically and if determined to be shorter than originally estimated depreciation and amortization charges would be accelerated over the revised useful life 

goodwill —goodwill of 536 million at december 31 2015 represents the tax effect of the differences between the tax and book bases of our assets and liabilities resulting from the revaluation of those assets and liabilities to fair value in connection with the company’s emergence from bankruptcy and adoption of freshstart accounting we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill of a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable 

we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors assessed for each of the reporting units include but are not limited to changes in longterm commodity prices discount rates competitive environments planned capacity cost factors such as raw material prices and financial performance of the reporting units if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a twostep quantitative test is required 

we also have the option to proceed directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test under the twostep impairment test the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill for step one of the impairment test the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated using a discounted cashflow model such a model inherently utilizes a significant number of estimates and assumptions including operating margins tax rates discount rates capital expenditures and working capital changes step two of the impairment test would be performed should management conclude that the carrying value of a reporting unit including goodwill is in excess of its fair value in step two of the impairment test the carrying amount of a reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of its goodwill valuation experts may be used in such an assessment if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment charge equal to the excess would be recognized 

  

for 2015 management performed a qualitative impairment assessment of our reporting units which indicated that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their carrying value accordingly a quantitative twostep goodwill impairment test was not required in 2014 management voluntarily performed a quantitative twostep goodwill impairment test for all reporting units the fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value accordingly no goodwill impairment was recognized in 2014 

longterm employee benefit costs —our costs for longterm employee benefits particularly pension and other postretirement medical and life insurance benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is management’s responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent its best estimates of the future effects of those uncertainties it also is management’s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 

the current benefit service costs as well as the existing liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis the discount rate is a current rate related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled our assumed discount rate is based on yield information for highquality corporate bonds with durations comparable to the expected cash settlement of our obligations for the purpose of measuring the benefit obligations at december 31 2015 we used a weighted average discount rate of 438 for the us plans which reflects the different terms of the related benefit obligations the weighted average discount rate used to measure obligations for nonus plans at december 31 2015 was 270 reflecting market interest rates the discount rates in effect at december 31 2015 will be used to measure net periodic benefit cost during 2016 

the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of other postretirement medical benefits are also measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits as of december 31 2015 the assumed rate of increase for our us plans was 73 decreasing to 45 in 2038 and thereafter a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate assumption would have had no significant effect on either the benefit liability or the net periodic cost due to limits on our maximum contribution level under the medical plan 

the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption investment returns that are recognized currently in net income represent the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets applied to a marketrelated value of plan assets which for us is defined as the market value of assets the expected rate of return on plan assets is a longer term rate and is expected to change less frequently than the current assumed discount rate reflecting longterm market expectations rather than current fluctuations in market conditions 

the weighted average expected longterm rate of return on assets in our us plans of 800 is based on the average level of earnings that our independent pension investment advisor had advised could be expected to be earned over time and 363 for our nonus plan assets is based on an expectation and asset allocation that varies by region the asset allocations are summarized in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements the actual returns in 2015 were a loss of 083 for us plan assets and a gain of 126 for nonus plan assets 

the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets management’s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 

net periodic pension cost recognized each year includes the expected asset earnings rather than the actual earnings or loss along with other gains and losses this unrecognized amount to the extent it cumulatively exceeds 10 of the projected benefit obligation for the respective plan is recognized as additional net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service period of the participants in each plan 

  

the following table reflects the sensitivity of the benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans to changes in the actuarial assumptions 

 

 the sensitivity of our postretirement benefit plans obligations and net periodic benefit costs to changes in actuarial assumptions are reflected in the following table 

 

 additional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

accruals for taxes based on income —the determination of our provision for income taxes and the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities is subject to management’s estimates and judgments due to the complexity of the tax laws and regulations in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of these complex laws and regulations 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 

we recognize future tax benefits to the extent that the realization of these benefits is more likely than not our current provision for income taxes is impacted by the recognition and release of valuation allowances related to net deferred assets in certain nonus jurisdictions further changes to these valuation allowances may impact our future provision for income taxes which will include no tax benefit with respect to losses incurred and no tax expense with respect to income generated in these countries until the respective valuation allowance is eliminated 

we recognize the financial statement benefits with respect to an uncertain income tax position that we have taken or may take on an income tax return when we believe it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities for a position that is likely to be sustained the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest cumulative amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of lyondellbasell industries nv’s management of commodity price risk foreign currency exposure and interest rate risk through its use of derivative instruments and hedging activities 

commodity price risk 

a substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change accordingly product margins and the level of our profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the business cycle we try to protect against such instability through various business strategies these include provisions in sales contracts allowing us to pass on higher raw material costs through timely price increases formula price contracts to transfer or share commodity price risk and increasing the depth and breadth of our product portfolio 

in addition we selectively use commodity swap and futures contracts with various terms to manage the volatility related to raw materials and product sales such contracts are generally limited to durations of one year or less hedge accounting has not been elected for any of our commodity contracts in any of the periods presented market risks created by these derivative instruments and the marktomarket valuations of open positions are considered by management prior to execution and monitored daily 

the estimated fair value and notional amounts of our open commodity futures contracts and swap contracts are shown in the table below 

 

 we use value at risk “var” stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes 

  

var estimates the maximum potential loss in fair market values given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time using specified confidence levels 

using sensitivity analysis and hypothetical changes in market prices ranging from 12 to 28 which represent a three month volatility range of the underlying products the effect on our pretax income would be 11 million the quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account the effects of the underlying operating transactions 

foreign exchange risk 

we manufacture and market our products in a number of countries throughout the world and as a result are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we enter into transactions in currencies other than the applicable functional currency 

a significant portion of our reporting entities use the euro as their functional currency our reporting currency is the us dollar the translation gains or losses that result from the process of translating the euro denominated financial statements to us dollars are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” until such time as those entities may be liquidated or sold changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro can therefore have a significant impact on comprehensive income 

in september 2015 we entered into €850 million 944 million crosscurrency floatingtofloating interest rate swaps “basis swaps” to reduce the volatility from foreign currency fluctuations associated with our net investment in foreign operations these swaps which have been classified as net investment hedges will mature between september 2016 and september 2018 under these contracts we will make interest payments in euros at 3 month euribor plus basis and will receive interest in us dollars at 3 month libor upon the maturities of these contracts we will pay the principal amount in euros and receive us dollars from our counterparties at december 31 2015 a 10 fluctuation in foreign currency rates would have had a 92 million impact on other comprehensive income loss a 10 fluctuation in the euribor and libor rates at december 31 2015 would have had an immaterial impact on other comprehensive income loss 

in december 2015 we also entered into €750 million 795 million of forward exchange contracts to reduce the volatility from foreign currency fluctuations associated with our net investment in foreign operations these forward exchange contracts which have been designated as net investment hedges require us to sell €750 million on march 31 2016 at the contracted forward exchange rate at december 31 2015 a 10 fluctuation in the euro  usd dollar rate would have had a €75 million 82 million impact on other comprehensive income loss 

some of our operations enter into transactions that are not denominated in their functional currency this results in exposure to foreign currency risk for financial instruments including but not limited to third party and intercompany receivables and payables and intercompany loans 

we maintain risk management control practices to monitor the foreign currency risk attributable to our intercompany and third party outstanding foreign currency balances these practices involve the centralization of our exposure to underlying currencies that are not subject to central bank andor country specific restrictions by centralizing most of our foreign currency exposure into one subsidiary we are able to take advantage of any natural offsets thereby reducing the overall impact of changes in foreign currency rates on our earnings at december 31 2015 a 10 fluctuation compared to the us dollar in the underlying currencies that have no central bank or other currency restrictions related to nonhedged monetary net assets would have had a resulting additional impact to earnings of approximately 1 million 

our policy is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies to minimize exchange gains and losses arising from changes in exchange rates to minimize the effects of our net currency exchange exposures we enter into foreign currency spot and forward contracts and in some cases crosscurrency swaps 

  

we also engage in shortterm foreign exchange swaps in order to roll certain hedge positions and to make funds available for intercompany financing our net position in foreign currencies is monitored daily 

we have entered into 2300 million of noncancellable crosscurrency swaps which we designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges to reduce the variability in the functional currency equivalent cash flows of certain foreign currency denominated intercompany notes for a summary of the estimated fair value and notional amounts for our crosscurrency swaps outstanding at december 31 2015 see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

for 2015 2014 and 2013 other income expense net in the consolidated statements of income reflected a loss of 7 million a gain of 15 million and a loss of 4 million respectively in net exchange rate gains and losses for forward contracts including swap transactions that economically hedge recognized monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies no hedge accounting is applied changes in the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are reported in the consolidated statements of income and offset the currency exchange results recognized on the assets and liabilities 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our fixed and variable rate debt fluctuations in interest rates impact the fair value of fixedrate debt as well as pretax earnings stemming from interest expense on variablerate debt 

fixedrate debt —in 2015 we entered into forwardstarting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of adverse changes in the benchmark interest rates on the anticipated refinancing of our senior notes due 2019 these interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges at december 31 2015 the total notional amount of these forwardstarting interest rate swaps was 1000 million 

in 2014 we entered into us dollar fixedforfloating interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy to create a balance of fixed and floating rate debt these interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges at december 31 2015 we had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling 2000 million maturing on april 15 2019 

at december 31 2015 after giving consideration to the 2000 million of fixedrate debt that we have effectively converted to floating through these us dollar fixedforfloating interest rate swaps approximately 72 of our debt portfolio on a gross basis incurred interest at a fixedrate and the remaining 28 of the portfolio incurred interest at a variablerate we estimate that a 10 change in market interest rates as of december 31 2015 would change the fair value of our interest rate swaps outstanding and would have had a resulting impact on our pretax income of approximately 9 million for additional information related to these interest rate swaps see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

variablerate debt —our variable rate debt consists of our 2000 million senior revolving credit facility our 900 million us receivables securitization facility our €450 million european receivables securitization facility and 323 million outstanding at december 31 2015 under our commercial paper program at december 31 2015 there were no outstanding borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility and us and european receivables facilities we estimate that a 10 change in interest rates would not have had a material impact on earnings

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

overview 

lyondellbasell industries nv is a global independent chemical company and was incorporated under dutch law on october 15 2009 unless otherwise indicated the “company” “we” “our” “us” and “lyondellbasell” are used in this report to refer to the businesses of lyondellbasell industries nv and its consolidated subsidiaries we are one of the world’s top five independent chemical companies based on revenues 

we participate globally across the petrochemical value chain and are an industry leader in many of our product lines our chemicals businesses consist primarily of large processing plants that convert large volumes of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon feedstocks into plastic resins and other chemicals our chemical products tend to be basic building blocks for other chemicals and plastics while our plastic products are typically used in large volume applications our customers use our plastics and chemicals to manufacture a wide range of products that people use in their everyday lives including food packaging home furnishings automotive components paints and coatings our refining business consists of our houston refinery which processes crude oil into products such as gasoline diesel and jet fuel 

our financial performance is influenced in general by the supply and demand for the products that we produce the cost and availability of feedstocks global and regional competitor capacity our operational efficiency and our ability to control costs we have a strong operational focus and as a producer of large volume commodities continuously strive to differentiate ourselves through safe reliable and lowcost operations in all our businesses during recent years the cost of natural gasderived raw materials in the us versus the global cost of crude oilderived raw materials has had a significant positive influence on the profitability of our north american operations to a lesser extent our differentiated assets and technology also positively influence our performance as compared to our peers and competitors these include our propylene oxide and polypropylene technologies flexible feedstock olefins plants in the us joint venture olefins and polyolefins plants with access to lowcost feedstock particularly in saudi arabia and our houston refinery which is capable of processing heavy highsulfur crude 

segments 

we manage our operations through five operating segments our reportable segments are 

 

  

  

  

  

 we regularly review our segments and the approach used by management to evaluate performance and resource allocation at the beginning of 2014 management began using ebitda earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization as the primary measure for reviewing our segments’ profitability our comparisons to the prior periods presented were revised to reflect this change 

  

financial information about our business segments and geographical areas can be found in note 22 segment and related information  to the consolidated financial statements information about the locations where we produce our primary products can be found under “description of properties” 

in 2014 2013 and 2012 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues 

olefins and polyolefins segments generally 

we are one of the leading worldwide producers of olefins including ethylene and propylene and polyethylene “pe” we are the world’s largest producer of polypropylene “pp” and pp compounds we manage our olefin and polyolefin business in two reportable segments op—americas and op—eai 

olefins —ethylene is the most significant petrochemical in terms of worldwide production volume and is the key building block for pe and a large number of other chemicals plastics and synthetics the production of ethylene results in coproducts such as aromatics and other olefins including propylene and butadiene ethylene and its coproducts are fundamental to many parts of the economy including the production of consumer products packaging housing and automotive components and other durable and nondurable goods 

polyolefins —polyolefins are thermoplastics and comprise approximately twothirds of worldwide thermoplastics demand since their industrial commercialization thermoplastics have been used in wideranging applications and products that improve safety and comfort and enhance the everyday quality of life our products are used in consumer automotive and industrial applications ranging from food and beverage packaging to housewares and construction materials we produce high density polyethylene “hdpe” low density polyethylene “ldpe” and linear low density polyethylene “lldpe” we also produce pp homopolymers pp impact copolymers and pp random copolymers we produce and market several specialty product lines including pp compounds catalloy process resins and polybutene1 “pb1” focusing on unique polyolefins and compounds that offer a wide range of performance characteristics typical properties of such specialty polyolefins and compounds include impactstiffness balance scratch resistance soft touch and heat sealability end uses include automotive and industrial products and materials pp compounds are produced from blends of polyolefins and additives and are sold mainly to the automotive and home appliances industries the catalloy process is proprietary technology that is not licensed to third parties as a result we are the only manufacturer of catalloy process resins which are used primarily in roofing packaging and automotive applications pb1 is a family of butanebased polymers and is mainly used in pipe applications and underfloor heating and thermosanitary systems 

pe sales including hdpe ldpe and lldpe accounted for approximately 18 17 and 15 of our total revenues in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively in 2014 we completed an expansion project at our matagorda plant in texas which added 220 million pounds of hdpe production pp sales including catalloy  accounted for approximately 16 16 and 15 of our total revenues in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

  

the following table outlines the primary products of our op segments annual processing capacity as of december 31 2014 and the primary uses for those products capacities which are presented in pounds unless otherwise indicated include 100 of the capacity of our joint venture facilities the joint ventures’ proportional share of capacity is shown in the footnote to the table below 

 

   

   

 

 olefins and polyolefins—americas segment 

overview 

our op—americas segment produces and markets olefins polyolefins aromatics specialty products and ethylene coproducts in addition we produce specialty products including catalloy and plexar resins 

sales  marketing  customers 

our ethylene production is consumed internally as a raw material in the production of polymers and other derivatives with the balance sold to third party customers under multiyear contracts or on a spot basis in 2014 we completed an 800 million pound per year ethylene expansion project at our la porte texas facility we have also announced two ethylene expansion projects for our channelview texas facility and one for our corpus christi texas facility which are projected for completion in 2015 channelview 2016 corpus christi and 2017 channelview in total we expect that these three projects will add additional ethylene capacity of approximately 16 billion pounds per year 

we are a net purchaser of propylene a raw material used in the production of po pp and other derivatives our butadiene production is sold to the external market under multiyear contracts all of our benzene production is used as a raw material in the production of styrene by our id segment 

in addition to purchases of propylene at times we purchase ethylene and butadiene for resale when necessary to satisfy customer demand above our own production levels volumes of any of these products purchased for resale can vary significantly from period to period however purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profits 

in the us most of the ethylene and propylene production of our channelview corpus christi and la porte texas facilities is shipped via a pipeline system which has connections to numerous us gulf coast consumers this pipeline system some of which is owned and some of which is leased extends from corpus christi to mont belvieu to port arthur texas as well as into the lake charles louisiana area in addition exchange agreements with other ethylene and coproducts producers allow access to customers who are not directly connected to this pipeline system some ethylene is shipped by rail car from clinton iowa to morris illinois and some is shipped directly to customers a pipeline owned and operated by an unrelated party is used to transport ethylene from morris illinois to tuscola illinois and is used as a raw material in the production of ethanol some propylene is shipped by ocean going vessel butadiene benzene toluene and other products are distributed by pipeline rail car truck barge or ocean going vessel 

our pp and pe production is typically sold through our sales organization to an extensive base of established customers and distributors servicing both the domestic and export markets either under annual contracts or on a spot basis we have regional sales offices in various locations in north america and our polyolefins primarily are transported in north america by railcar or truck export sales are generally to customers in central and south america we also sell pp to our pp compounds business which is managed worldwide by our op—eai segment 

  

joint venture relationships 

we participate in a joint venture arrangement in mexico which provides us with capacity for approximately 640 million pounds of pp production the capacity is based on our percentage ownership of the joint ventures’ total capacity we do not hold a majority interest in or have operational control of this joint venture 

raw materials 

raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost for the production of ethylene and its coproducts the primary raw materials that can be used in our americas olefin facilities are heavy liquids and natural gas liquids “ngls” heavy liquids include crude oilbased naphtha and gas oil as well as domestically sourced condensate a very light crude oil resulting from natural gas production collectively referred to as “heavy liquids” ngls include ethane propane and butane the use of heavy liquid raw materials results in the production of a significant amount of coproducts such as propylene butadiene and benzene as well as gasoline blending components while the use of ngls results in the production of a smaller amount of coproducts 

our ability to pass through raw material price increases to our customers is dependent upon marketdriven demand for olefins and polyolefins sales prices for products sold in the spot market are determined by market forces our contract prices are influenced by spot prices indices published in industry publications and cost recovery formulas in the contracts 

historically facilities using heavy liquids as feedstock generated higher margins than those using ngls however in recent years ngls have had a significant cost advantage over heavy liquids due to technological advances for extracting shale gas which have led to an increased supply of ngls a plant’s flexibility to consume a wide range of raw materials generally will provide an advantage over plants that are restricted in their processing capabilities our americas facilities can process significant quantities of either heavy liquids or ngls we estimate that in the us we can produce up to approximately 90 of our total ethylene output using ngls changes in the raw material feedstock utilized in the production process will result in variances in production capacities among products we believe our raw material flexibility in the us is a key advantage in our production of ethylene and its coproducts 

in north america we also purchase large amounts of natural gas to be used primarily as an energy source in our business and as the primary feedstock for methanol production by our id segment via marketbased contractual arrangements from multiple suppliers 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to olefins and polyolefins competition is based on price product quality product delivery reliability of supply product performance and customer service industry consolidation in north america has led to fewer although larger competitors profitability is affected not only by supply and demand for olefins and polyolefins but also by raw material costs and price competition among producers which may intensify due to among other things the addition of new capacity in general demand is a function of worldwide economic growth which fluctuates 

we compete in north america with other large marketers and producers including global chemical companies chemical divisions of large oil companies and regional marketers and producers 

based on published data we believe we were as of december 31 2014

our op—eai segment produces and markets olefins including ethylene and ethylene coproducts and polyolefins in addition we produce significant quantities of specialty products such as catalloy process resins and pb1 our op—eai segment manages our worldwide pp compound business including our pp compounds facilities in north and south america our worldwide pb1 business and our catalloy process resins produced in europe 

sales  marketing  customers 

our ethylene production is primarily consumed internally as a raw material in the production of polymers and we purchase additional ethylene to meet our production needs our propylene production is used as a raw material in the production of po and pp and we purchase propylene when our internal needs exceed our internal production european ethylene production is generally fully integrated with our downstream facilities in europe 

we produce and sell butadiene to external customers under multiyear contracts and on a spot basis 

with respect to pp and pe our production is typically sold through our sales organization to an extensive base of established customers under annual contracts or on a spot basis and is also sold through distributors our polyolefins are transported in europe primarily by railcar or truck we believe that over a business cycle average sales prices and profit margins for specialty polymers tend to be higher than average sales prices and profit margins for highervolume commodity polyolefins or polymers 

our regional sales offices are in various locations including the netherlands hong kong china india australia and the united arab emirates we also operate through a worldwide network of local sales and representative offices in europe asia and africa our joint ventures typically manage their domestic sales and marketing efforts independently and we typically operate as their agentdistributor for all or a portion of their exports 

joint venture relationships 

we participate in several manufacturing joint ventures in saudi arabia thailand poland australia japan and south korea we do not hold majority interests in any of these joint ventures nor do we have operational control these ventures provide us with additional production capacity of approximately 2630 million pounds of pp approximately 810 million pounds of propylene approximately 550 million pounds of ethylene approximately 570 million pounds of hdpe approximately 340 million pounds of ldpe and approximately 160 million pounds of pp compounds these capacities are based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint ventures’ total capacities we realize profits or losses from these ventures as income from equity investments 

we generally license our polyolefin process technologies and supply catalysts to our joint ventures through our technology segment some of our joint ventures source cost advantaged raw materials from their local shareholders 

raw materials 

raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost for the production of ethylene and its coproducts the primary raw materials used in our european olefin facilities are heavy liquids however in recent years we have sourced increased amounts of advantaged ngls when the opportunity arises for our saudi joint 

  

venture facilities locally sourced and cost advantaged ngls including ethane propane and butane are used the principal raw materials used by our polyolefin and catalloy process resin businesses are propylene and ethylene in europe we have the capacity to produce approximately 50 of the propylene requirements of our european pp business and all of the ethylene requirements of our european pe business propylene and ethylene requirements that are not produced internally are generally acquired via spot purchases or pursuant to longterm contracts with third party suppliers 

our pp compounds facilities generally receive their pp and other polymer raw materials from one of our wholly owned or joint venture facilities pb1 raw materials are sourced solely from external supply some of our joint ventures receive propylene and ethylene from their local shareholders under longterm contracts 

our ability to pass through the increased cost of raw materials to customers is dependent on market demand for olefins and polyolefins in general the pricing for purchases and sales of most products is determined by market forces including the impacts of foreign exchange on the pricing of the underlying heavy liquid raw materials most of which are priced in us dollars there can be a lag between observed naphtha raw material price changes in a given month and contract product price changes that were settled prior to the beginning of that month in such cases volatility in our product margins may occur 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to olefins and polyolefins competition is based on price product quality product delivery reliability of supply product performance and customer service we compete with regional and multinational chemical companies and divisions of large oil companies the petrochemical market in the european union “eu” has been affected by the price volatility of naphtha the primary feedstock for olefins in the region as well as fluctuating demand as a result of uncertain economic conditions 

based on published data and including our proportionate share of our joint ventures we believe we were as of december 31 2014 

 

  

  

  

 intermediates and derivatives segment 

overview 

our id segment produces and markets po and its coproducts and derivatives acetyls including methanol ethylene oxide “eo” and its derivatives ethanol and oxyfuels methyl tertiary butyl ether “mtbe” and ethyl tertiary butyl ether “etbe” po coproducts include styrene monomer “sm” and c4 chemicals tertiary butyl alcohol “tba” most of which is used to make oxyfuels isobutylene and tertiary butyl hydro peroxide “tbhp” po derivatives include propylene glycol “pg” propylene glycol ethers “pge” and butanediol “bdo” we believe that our proprietary po and acetyls production process technologies provide us with a cost advantaged position for these products and their derivatives 

  

we produce po through two distinct technologies one of which yields tba as the coproduct and the other of which yields sm as the coproduct the two technologies are mutually exclusive meaning that a manufacturing facility must be dedicated to either potba or to posm 

the following table outlines the primary products annual capacities and primary uses for the id segment’s products capacities which are presented in pounds unless otherwise indicated include 100 of the capacity of joint venture facilities the joint ventures’ proportional share of capacity is shown in the footnote to the table below 

 

   

  

 sales  marketing  customers 

we sell our po and its coproducts and derivatives through multiyear sales agreements and spot sales and have a number of multiyear processing agreements some of our contract sales agreements have cost plus pricing terms we sell most of our sm production into the north american and european merchant markets and to asian and south american export markets through longterm sales contracts and processing agreements we purchase sm for resale when necessary to satisfy customer demand that exceeds our production levels volumes of sm purchases made for resale can vary significantly from period to period however purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profits po and sm are transported by barge ocean going vessel pipeline railcar and tank truck 

our id segment converts most of its tba which is produced as a coproduct of the po process to isobutylene over half of the isobutylene is reacted with methanol or ethanol to produce either mtbe or etbe the remaining isobutylene is sold into the external market as highpurity grade isobutylene 

in august of 2014 we announced our intention to build a world scale potba plant on the us gulf coast with an annual capacity of 1 billion pounds of po and 2 billion pounds of tba and its derivatives the preliminary timetable is to have the plant operational in 2019 

we sell our mtbe and etbe production under market and costbased sales agreements and in the spot market mtbe and etbe are transported by barge ocean going vessel and tank truck substantially all refiners and blenders have discontinued the use of mtbe in the us partly as a result of governmental initiatives to increase use of bioethanol in gasoline and to reduce or effectively ban the use of mtbe however mtbeetbe demand for gasoline blending remains strong in most of the remaining worldwide market accordingly we market mtbe and etbe produced in the us for use outside of the us japan has opted to use etbe as a means of meeting its carbon dioxide reduction commitments under the kyoto protocol and we source a significant portion of japan’s biofuels needs some of our plants have the flexibility to produce either mtbe or etbe to accommodate market needs 

  

sales of mtbe etbe acetyls po and po coproducts and derivatives are made by our marketing and sales personnel and also through distributors and independent agents in the americas europe the middle east africa and the asia pacific region 

acetyls including acetic acid and vam are consumed internally and sold worldwide under multiyear contracts and on a spot basis acetic acid and vam are shipped by barge ocean going vessel pipeline railcar and tank truck sales are made through a direct sales force agents and distributors our acetyls business uses methanol which we produce internally as a raw material for our production of acetic acid solvents and mtbe and we also sell methanol under annual contracts and on a spot basis to large us customers methanol is shipped by barge railcar and pipeline 

eo and eg typically are sold under multiyear contracts and on a spot basis with market and costbased pricing glycol ethers are sold primarily into the solvent and distributor markets at market prices the vast majority of the ethylene derivative products are sold in north america europe and asia primarily through our sales organizations eo is shipped by railcar and its derivatives are shipped by railcar truck isotank and ocean going vessel 

joint venture relationships 

we have two po joint ventures with bayer corporation one in the us and one in europe we operate four of our us operating units for the us po joint venture bayer’s interest represents ownership of an inkind portion of the po production of 15 billion pounds per year we take inkind the remaining po production and all coproduct sm and tba production we do not share marketing or product sales with bayer under the us po joint venture the parties’ rights in the joint venture are based on off take volumes as opposed to ownership percentages bayer also has the right to 50 of the po and sm production of our european po joint venture our proportional additional production capacity provided through this venture is approximately 340 million pounds of po and approximately 750 million pounds of sm 

we also have joint venture manufacturing relationships in china these ventures provide us with additional production capacity of approximately 115 million pounds of po this capacity is based on our operational share of the joint ventures’ total capacities 

in december 2013 we sold our 40 ownership interest in nihon oxirane company a joint venture in japan that produces po pg and sm for more information see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

raw materials 

the cost of raw materials generally is the largest component of total production cost for po and its coproducts and derivatives propylene isobutane mixed butane ethylene and benzene are the primary raw materials used in the production of po and its coproducts and derivatives the market prices of these raw materials historically have been related to the price of crude oil ngls and natural gas as well as supply and demand for the raw materials 

in the us we obtain a large portion of our propylene benzene and ethylene raw materials needed for the production of po and its coproducts and derivatives from our op—americas segment raw materials for the nonus production of po and its coproducts and derivatives are obtained from our op—eai segment and from third parties we consume a significant portion of our internallyproduced po in the production of po derivatives 

the raw material requirements not sourced internally are purchased at marketbased prices from numerous suppliers in the us and europe with which we have established contractual relationships as well as in the spot market 

  

we purchase our ethanol requirements for the production of etbe from third parties the methanol for our mtbe production comes from internal production and third parties carbon monoxide and methanol are the primary raw materials required for the production of acetic acid we purchase carbon monoxide pursuant to a longterm contract with pricing primarily based on the cost of production all methanol required for our production of acetyls is internally sourced natural gas is the primary raw material required for the production of methanol 

in addition to ethylene acetic acid is a primary raw material for the production of vam for the production of vam we obtain our entire requirements for acetic acid and ethylene from our internal production historically we have used a large percentage of our acetic acid production to produce vam 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to po its coproducts and derivatives competition is based on a variety of factors including product quality and price reliability of supply technical support customer service and potential substitute materials profitability is affected by the worldwide level of demand along with price competition which may intensify due to among other things new industry capacity po demand growth could be impacted by further development of alternative biobased po derivatives it is not possible to predict accurately the changes in raw material costs market conditions and other factors that will affect industry profitability in the future our major worldwide competitors for sales of po its coproducts and derivatives include other multinational chemical companies as well as some regional marketers and producers 

based on published data excluding our partners’ shares of joint venture capacity we believe as of december 31 2014 we were 

 

  

  

  

 refining segment 

overview 

our houston refinery which is located on the houston ship channel in houston texas has a heavy highsulfur crude oil processing capacity of approximately 268000 barrels per day on a calendar day basis normal operating basis or approximately 292000 barrels per day on a stream day basis maximum achievable over a 24 hour period the houston refinery has a nelson complexity index of 125 the houston refinery is a full conversion refinery designed to refine heavy highsulfur crude oil this crude oil is more viscous and dense than traditional crude oil and contains higher concentrations of sulfur and heavy metals making it more difficult to refine into gasoline and other highvalue fuel products however this crude oil has historically been less costly to purchase than light lowsulfur crude oil such as brent in the recent past certain crudes such as west texas intermediate wti and west texas sour wts have been priced lower than normal trends due to transportation constraints however in 2014 these price differentials have narrowed 

on january 4 2012 we ceased refinery operations at our berre refinery in france the cessation of operations was in accordance with an agreement executed in the fourth quarter of 2011 by certain of our french subsidiaries and union representatives additional information about the cessation of operations can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 3 discontinued operations  to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the following table outlines the primary products of our refining segment annual processing capacities as of as of december 31 2014 and the primary uses for those products capacities are presented in barrels per day 

 

  

 sales  marketing  customers 

gasoline sales accounted for 9 of our total revenues in each of the years 2014 and 2013 and 10 in 2012 the houston refinery’s products primarily are sold in bulk to other refiners marketers distributors and wholesalers at marketrelated prices most of the houston refinery’s products are sold under contracts with a term of one year or less or are sold in the spot market the houston refinery’s products generally are transported to customers via pipelines and terminals owned and operated by other parties 

raw materials 

we purchase the crude oil used as a raw material for the houston refinery on the open market on a spot basis and under a number of supply agreements with regional producers generally with terms varying from one to three years 

industry dynamics  competition 

our refining competitors are major integrated oil companies refineries owned or controlled by foreign governments and independent domestic refiners based on published data as of january 2014 there were 142 operable crude oil refineries in the us and total us refinery capacity was approximately 179 million barrels per day during 2014 the houston refinery processed an average of approximately 259000 barrels per day of crude oil representing approximately 14 of all us crude processing capacity 

our refining operations compete for the purchases of crude oil based on price and quality supply disruptions could impact the availability and pricing we compete in gasoline and distillate markets as a bulk supplier of fungible products satisfying industry and government specifications competition is based on price and location 

the markets for fuel products tend to be volatile as well as cyclical as a result of the changing global economy and changing crude oil and refined product prices crude oil prices are impacted by worldwide political events the economics of exploration and production and refined products demand prices and demand for fuel products are influenced by seasonal and shortterm factors such as weather and driving patterns as well as by longer term issues such as the economy energy conservation and alternative fuels industry fuel products supply is dependent on shortterm industry operating capabilities and on longterm refining capacity 

a crack spread is a benchmark indication of refining margins based on the processing of a specific type of crude oil into an assumed selection of refined products the houston refinery generally tracks the maya 211 crack spread which represents the difference between the first month futures price of two barrels of maya crude oil as set by pemex and one barrel each of us gulf coast 87 octane conventional gasoline and of us gulf 

  

coast ultralowsulfur diesel “ulsd” while these benchmark refining spreads are generally indicative of the level of profitability at the houston refinery and similarly configured refineries there are many other factors specific to each refinery and the industry in general such as the cost of renewable identification numbers “rins” and the value of byproducts which influence operating results 

technology segment 

overview 

our technology segment develops and licenses chemical polyolefin and other process technologies and provides associated engineering and other services our technology segment also develops manufactures and sells polyolefin catalysts we market our process technologies and our polyolefin catalysts to external customers and also use them in our own manufacturing operations 

our polyolefin process licenses are structured to provide a standard core technology with individual customer needs met by adding customized modules that provide the required capabilities to produce the defined production grade slate and plant capacity in addition to the basic license agreement a range of services can also be provided including project assistance training assistance in starting up the plant and ongoing technical support after startup we may also offer marketing and sales services in addition licensees may continue to purchase polyolefin catalysts that are consumed in the production process generally under longterm catalyst supply agreements with us 

process technology licensing 

we are a leading licensor of polyolefin process technologies we also license a selective portfolio of chemical process technologies in the fields of olefin recovery olefin conversion aromatics extraction and acetyls 

polyolefin catalysts 

we are a leading manufacturer and supplier of polyolefin catalysts approximately 25 of our catalyst sales are intercompany as we are a large polyolefin producer

general 




 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 

our business including our results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected by safety or product liability issues 

failure to appropriately manage safety human health product liability and environmental risks associated with our products product life cycles and production processes could adversely impact employees communities stakeholders our reputation and our results of operations public perception of the risks associated with our products and production processes could impact product acceptance and influence the regulatory environment in which we operate while we have procedures and controls to manage safety risks issues could be created by events outside of our control including natural disasters severe weather events and acts of sabotage 

our operations are subject to risks inherent in chemical and refining businesses and we could be subject to liabilities for which we are not fully insured or that are not otherwise mitigated 

we maintain property business interruption product general liability casualty and other types of insurance that we believe are in accordance with customary industry practices however we are not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to our business including losses resulting from natural disasters wars or terrorist acts changes in insurance market conditions have caused and may in the future cause premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies to increase substantially and in some instances for certain insurance to become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured we might not be able to finance the amount of the uninsured liability on terms acceptable to us or at all and might be obligated to divert a significant portion of our cash flow from normal business operations 

further because a part of our business involves licensing polyolefin process technology our licensees are exposed to similar risks involved in the manufacture and marketing of polyolefins hazardous incidents involving our licensees if they do result or are perceived to result from use of our technologies may harm our reputation threaten our relationships with other licensees andor lead to customer attrition and financial losses our policy of covering these risks through contractual limitations of liability and indemnities and through 

  

insurance may not always be effective as a result our financial condition and results of operation would be adversely affected and other companies with competing technologies may have the opportunity to secure a competitive advantage 

our ability to source raw materials including crude oil may be adversely affected by political instability civil disturbances or other governmental actions 

we obtain a substantial portion of our principal raw materials from sources in north africa the middle east mexico and south america that may be less politically stable than other areas in which we conduct business such as europe or the us political instability civil disturbances and actions by governments in these areas are likely to substantially increase the price and decrease the supply of raw materials necessary for our operations which will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

recently increased incidents of civil unrest including terrorist attacks and demonstrations that have been marked by violence have occurred in a number of countries in north africa and the middle east some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest political instability and civil unrest could continue to spread in the region and involve other areas such unrest if it continues to spread or grow in intensity could lead to civil wars regional conflicts or regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to countries in which we conduct substantial business such as in europe the us or their respective allies 

a substantial decrease in the price of crude oil may adversely impact our results of operations 

energy costs generally follow price trends of crude oil and natural gas these price trends may be highly volatile and cyclical in the past raw material and energy costs have experienced significant fluctuations that adversely affected our business segments’ results of operations for example we continue to benefit from the favorable ratio of us natural gas prices to crude oil prices however if the price of crude oil decreases relative to us natural gas prices or if the demand for natural gas and ngls increases this may have a negative result on our results of operations 

costs and limitations on supply of raw materials and energy may result in increased operating expenses 

the costs of raw materials and energy represent a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to the significant competition we face and the commodity nature of many of our products we are not always able to pass on raw material and energy cost increases to our customers when we do have the ability to pass on the cost increases we are not always able to do so quickly enough to avoid adverse impacts on our results of operations 

cost increases for raw materials also may increase working capital needs which could reduce our liquidity and cash flow even if we increase our sales prices to reflect rising raw material and energy costs demand for products may decrease as customers reduce their consumption or use substitute products which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition producers in natural gas costadvantaged regions such as the middle east and north america benefit from the lower prices of natural gas and ngls competition from producers in these regions may cause us to reduce exports from europe and elsewhere any such reductions may increase competition for product sales within europe and other markets which can result in lower margins in those regions 

for some of our raw materials and utilities there are a limited number of suppliers and in some cases the supplies are specific to the particular geographic region in which a facility is located it is also common in the chemical and refining industries for a facility to have a sole dedicated source for its utilities such as steam electricity and gas having a sole or limited number of suppliers may limit our negotiating power particularly in the case of rising raw material costs any new supply agreements we enter into may not have terms as favorable as those contained in our current supply agreements 

additionally there is growing concern over the reliability of water sources including around the texas gulf coast where several of our facilities are located the decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of population growth drought or regulation could negatively impact our operations 

  

if our raw material or utility supplies were disrupted our businesses may incur increased costs to procure alternative supplies or incur excessive downtime which would have a direct negative impact on plant operations disruptions of supplies may occur as a result of transportation issues including but not limited to as a result of natural disasters and water levels that can affect the operations of vessels barges rails trucks and pipeline traffic these risks are particularly prevalent in the us gulf coast area additionally the export of ngls from the us greater restrictions on hydraulic fracturing or the lifting by the us government of the ban on us crude oil exports could restrict the availability of our raw materials thereby increasing our costs 

with increased volatility in raw material costs our suppliers could impose more onerous terms on us resulting in shorter payment cycles and increasing our working capital requirements 

economic disruptions and downturns in general and particularly continued economic uncertainty in europe or economic turmoil in emerging markets could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

our results of operations can be materially affected by adverse conditions in the financial markets and depressed economic conditions generally economic downturns in the businesses and geographic areas in which we sell our products substantially reduce demand for our products and result in decreased sales volumes and increased credit risk recessionary environments adversely affect our business because demand for our products is reduced particularly from our customers in industrial markets generally and the automotive and housing industries specifically and may result in higher costs of capital a significant portion of our revenues and earnings are derived from our business in europe including southern europe in addition most of our european transactions and assets including cash reserves and receivables are denominated in euros 

europe’s recovery from the economic crisis has continued to be uneven slow and modest if the crisis reemerges or meaningful recovery does not materialize across europe there will likely be a continued negative effect on our european business as well as the businesses of our european customers suppliers and partners in addition if the crisis leads to a significant devaluation of the euro the value of our financial assets that are denominated in euros would be significantly reduced when translated to us dollars for financial reporting purposes we also derive significant revenues from our business in emerging markets particularly the emerging markets in asia and brazil any broadbased downturn in these emerging markets or in a key market such as china could require us to reduce export volumes into these markets and could also require us to divert product sales to less profitable markets any of these conditions could ultimately harm our overall business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

the cyclicality and volatility of the industries in which we participate may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 

our business operations are subject to the cyclical and volatile nature of the supplydemand balance in the chemical and refining industries our future operating results are expected to continue to be affected by this cyclicality and volatility the chemical and refining industries historically have experienced alternating periods of capacity shortages causing prices and profit margins to increase followed by periods of excess capacity resulting in oversupply declining capacity utilization rates and declining prices and profit margins 

in addition to changes in the supply and demand for products changes in energy prices and other worldwide economic conditions can cause volatility these factors result in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over business cycles 

new capacity additions in asia the middle east and north america may lead to periods of oversupply and lower profitability a sizable number of expansions have been announced in north america the timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions are uncertain and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time as a consequence we are unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of future industry cycles or their effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we sell products in highly competitive global markets and face significant price pressures 

we sell our products in highly competitive global markets due to the commodity nature of many of our products competition in these markets is based primarily on price and to a lesser extent on product performance product quality product deliverability reliability of supply and customer service generally we are not able to protect our market position for these products by product differentiation and may not be able to pass on cost increases to our customers due to the significant competition in our business 

in addition we face increased competition from companies that may have greater financial resources and different cost structures or strategic goals than us these include large integrated oil companies some of which also have chemical businesses governmentowned businesses and companies that receive subsidies or other government incentives to produce certain products in a specified geographic region increased competition from these companies especially in our olefin and refining businesses could limit our ability to increase product sales prices in response to raw material and other cost increases or could cause us to reduce product sales prices to compete effectively which could reduce our profitability competitors that have greater financial resources than us may be able to invest significant capital into their businesses including expenditures for research and development 

in addition specialty products we produce may become commoditized over time increased competition could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 

interruptions of operations at our facilities may result in liabilities or lower operating results 

we own and operate largescale facilities our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our various production facilities and the ability to complete construction and maintenance projects on schedule interruptions at our facilities may materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or our business as a whole during and after the period of such operational difficulties in the past we had to shut down plants on the us gulf coast including the temporary shutdown of our houston refinery as a result of hurricanes striking the texas coast 

in addition because the houston refinery is our only refining operation an outage at the refinery could have a particularly negative impact on our operating results unlike our chemical and polymer production facilities which may have sufficient excess capacity to mitigate the negative impact of lost production at other facilities we do not have the ability to increase refining production elsewhere in the us 

although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions our operations are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and refining and the related storage and transportation of raw materials products and wastes these potential hazards include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or personal injury and loss of life and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities 

increased it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products facilities and services 

increased global information security threats and more sophisticated targeted computer crime pose a risk to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data operations and infrastructure while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our employees systems networks products facilities and services remain potentially vulnerable to sophisticated espionage or continual cyberassault depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations 

we operate internationally and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations exchange controls political risks and other risks relating to international operations 

we operate internationally and are subject to the risks of doing business on a global level these risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates economic instability and disruptions restrictions on the transfer of funds and the imposition of duties and tariffs additional risks from our multinational business include transportation delays and interruptions war terrorist activities epidemics pandemics political instability import and export controls changes in governmental policies labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments 

we generate revenues from export sales and operations that may be denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency exchange rates between these currencies and functional currencies in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future we also could hedge certain revenues and costs using derivative instruments to minimize the impact of changes in the exchange rates of those currencies compared to the respective functional currencies it is possible that fluctuations in exchange rates will result in reduced operating results additionally we operate with the objective of having our worldwide cash available in the locations where it is needed including the united kingdom for our parent company’s significant cash obligations as a result of dividend and interest payments it is possible that we may not always be able to provide cash to other jurisdictions when needed or that such transfers of cash could be subject to additional taxes including withholding taxes 

our operating results could be negatively affected by the global laws rules and regulations as well as political environments in the jurisdictions in which we operate there could be reduced demand for our products decreases in the prices at which we can sell our products and disruptions of production or other operations 

  

additionally there may be substantial capital and other costs to comply with regulations andor increased security costs or insurance premiums any of which could reduce our operating results 

we obtain a substantial portion of our principal raw materials from international sources that are subject to these same risks our compliance with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject could be challenged furthermore these laws may be modified the result of which may be to prevent or limit subsidiaries from transferring cash to us 

furthermore we are subject to certain existing and may be subject to possible future laws that limit or may limit our activities while some of our competitors may not be subject to such laws which may adversely affect our competitiveness 

changes in tax laws and regulations could affect our tax rate and our results of operations 

we are a tax resident in the united kingdom and are subject to the united kingdom corporate income tax system however as a holding company our tax obligations are primarily incurred in the various jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate recently there has been an increase in attention both in the us and in europe to the tax practices of multinational companies such attention may result in legislative changes that could affect our tax rate in addition certain jurisdictions in which we conduct business and incur a tax liability are considering proposals to change their tax laws while we are not aware of any impending changes to legislation or tax regulations any change in our tax rate would impact our results of operations 

failure to comply with the foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws may have an adverse effect on us 

our international operations require us to comply with a number of us and international laws and regulations including those involving antibribery and anticorruption in order to effectively operate in certain foreign jurisdictions circumstances may require that we establish joint ventures with local operators or find strategic partners as an issuer with securities listed on a united states stock exchange we are subject to the regulations imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa which generally prohibits issuers and their intermediaries including strategic or local partners or agents even if those partners or agents are not themselves subject to the fcpa or other similar laws from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or obtaining an improper business benefit we have an ongoing program to promote compliance with the fcpa and other similar antibribery and anticorruption laws any determination that we have violated the fcpa or other similar laws could have a material effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

many of our businesses depend on our intellectual property our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and our inability to do so could reduce our ability to maintain our competitiveness and margins 

we have a significant worldwide patent portfolio of issued and pending patents these patents together with proprietary technical knowhow are significant to our competitive position particularly with regard to po performance chemicals petrochemicals and polymers including process technologies such as spheripol  spherizone  hostalen  spherilene  lupotech t and avant catalyst family technology rights we rely on the patent copyright and trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing however we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without authorization proceedings to protect these rights could be costly and we may not prevail 

the protection afforded by patents varies from country to country and depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage while a presumption of validity exists with respect to patents issued to us our patents may 

  

be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable as patents expire the products and processes described and claimed under those patents become generally available for use by competitors 

our continued growth strategy may bring us to regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce in addition patent rights may not prevent our competitors from developing using or selling products that are similar or functionally equivalent to our products moreover our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner which could result in significantly lower revenues reduced profit margins or loss of market share 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary knowhow and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property these confidentiality agreements may be breached may not always be executed may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies may not be available additionally others could obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal or illegal means 

the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes apparatuses technology trade secrets or proprietary knowhow could result in significantly lower revenues reduced profit margins and cash flows andor loss of market share we also may be subject to claims that our technology patents or other intellectual property infringes on a third party’s intellectual property rights unfavorable resolution of these claims could result in restrictions on our ability to deliver the related service or in a settlement that could be material to us 

shared control or lack of control of joint ventures may delay decisions or actions regarding the joint ventures 

a portion of our operations are conducted through joint ventures where control may be exercised by or shared with unaffiliated third parties we cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners including any nonperformance default or bankruptcy of joint venture partners the joint ventures that we do not control may also lack adequate internal controls systems or financial reporting systems to provide adequate and timely information for our reporting purposes 

in the event that any of our joint venture partners do not observe their obligations it is possible that the affected joint venture would not be able to operate in accordance with our business plans as a result we could be required to increase our level of commitment in order to give effect to such plans differences in views among the joint venture participants also may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major matters potentially adversely affecting the business and operations of the joint ventures and in turn our business and operations 

we cannot predict with certainty the extent of future costs under environmental health and safety and other laws and regulations and cannot guarantee they will not be material 

we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture handle or own in addition because our products are components of a variety of other enduse products we along with other members of the chemical industry are subject to potential claims related to those enduse products any substantial increase in the success of these types of claims could negatively affect our operating results 

we together with the industries in which we operate are subject to extensive national regional state and local environmental laws regulations directives rules and ordinances concerning 

 

  

   

 many of these laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations in addition some of these laws and regulations require us to meet specific financial responsibility requirements any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

although we have compliance programs and other processes intended to ensure compliance with all such regulations we are subject to the risk that our compliance with such regulations could be challenged noncompliance with certain of these regulations could result in the incurrence of additional costs penalties or assessments that could be material 

our industry is subject to extensive government regulation and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures 

compliance with regulatory requirements could result in higher operating costs such as regulatory requirements relating to emissions the security of our facilities and the transportation export or registration of our products we generally expect that regulatory controls worldwide will become increasingly more demanding but cannot accurately predict future developments 

increasingly strict environmental laws and inspection and enforcement policies could affect the handling manufacture use emission or disposal of products other materials or hazardous and nonhazardous waste stricter environmental safety and health laws regulations and enforcement policies could result in increased operating costs or capital expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations additionally we are required to have permits for our businesses and are subject to licensing regulations these permits and licenses are subject to renewal modification and in some circumstances revocation further the permits and licenses are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

we may incur substantial costs to comply with climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives 

there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas “ghg” reduction these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future laws in this field continue to evolve and while they are likely to be increasingly widespread and stringent at this stage it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation within the framework of the eu emissions trading scheme “ets” we were allocated certain allowances of carbon dioxide for the affected plants of our european sites for the period from 2008 to 2012 “ets ii period” the ets ii period did not bring additional cost to us as the allowance allocation was sufficient to cover the actual emissions of the affected plants we were able to build an allowance surplus during the ets ii period which has been banked to the scheme for the period from 2013 to 2020 “ets iii period” we expect to incur additional costs for the ets iii period despite the allowance surplus accrued over the ets ii period as allowance allocations have been reduced for the ets iii period and more of our plants are affected by the scheme we maintain an active hedging strategy to cover these additional costs we expect to incur additional costs in relation to future carbon or ghg emission trading schemes 

in the us the environmental protection agency the “epa” has promulgated federal ghg regulations under the clean air act affecting certain sources the epa has issued mandatory ghg reporting requirements requirements to obtain ghg permits for certain industrial plants and proposals for ghg performance standards for some facilities the recent epa action could be a precursor to further federal regulation of carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases and may affect the outcome of other climate change lawsuits pending in 

  

us courts in a manner unfavorable to our industry in any event additional regulation may be forthcoming at the us federal or state level with respect to ghg emissions and such regulation could result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances 

compliance with these or other changes in laws regulations and obligations that create a ghg emissions trading scheme or ghg reduction policies generally could significantly increase our costs or reduce demand for products we produce additionally compliance with these regulations may result in increased permitting necessary for the operation of our business or for any of our growth plans difficulties in obtaining such permits could have an adverse effect on our future growth therefore any future potential regulations and legislation could result in increased compliance costs additional operating restrictions or delays in implementing growth projects or other capital investments and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may be required to record material charges against our earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets 

we may be required to reduce production at or idle facilities for extended periods of time or exit certain businesses as a result of the cyclical nature of our industry specifically oversupplies of or lack of demand for particular products or high raw material prices may cause us to reduce production we may choose to reduce production at certain facilities because we have offtake arrangements at other facilities which make any reductions or idling unavailable at those facilities any decision to permanently close facilities or exit a business likely would result in impairment and other charges to earnings 

temporary outages at our facilities can last for several quarters and sometimes longer these outages could cause us to incur significant costs including the expenses of maintaining and restarting these facilities in addition even though we may reduce production at facilities we may be required to continue to purchase or pay for utilities or raw materials under takeorpay supply agreements 

our business is capital intensive and we rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and ongoing capital needs limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results 

we require significant capital to operate our current business and fund our growth strategy moreover interest payments dividends and the expansion of our business or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital we believe that our cash from operations currently will be sufficient to meet these needs however if we need external financing our access to credit markets and pricing of our capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies and the state of the capital markets generally there can be no assurances that we would be able to incur indebtedness on terms we deem acceptable and it is possible that the cost of any financings could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities which could adversely affect our operating results 

we may use our fiveyear 2 billion revolving credit facility which backs our commercial paper program to meet our cash needs to the extent available as of december 31 2014 we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the facility and 262 million outstanding under our commercial paper program leaving an unused and available credit capacity of 1712 million we may also meet our cash needs by selling receivables under our 1000 million us accounts receivable securitization facility or our €450 million european accounts receivable securitization facility in the event of a default under our credit facility or any of our senior notes we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do any default under any of our credit arrangements could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments 

  

without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate 

legislation and regulatory initiatives could lead to a decrease in demand for our products 

new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health safety and the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products initiatives by governments and private interest groups will potentially require increased toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us for example in the united states the national toxicology program “ntp” is a federal interagency program that seeks to identify and select for study chemicals and other substances to evaluate potential human health hazards in the european union the regulation on registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals “reach” is regulation designed to identify the intrinsic properties of chemical substances assess hazards and risks of the substances and identify and implement the risk management measures to protect humans and the environment 

assessments under ntp reach or similar programs or regulations in other jurisdictions may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals we use or produce and may result in additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of those chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the identification and development of talent to succeed senior management 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and we rely heavily on our management team the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations in addition because of the reliance on our management team our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management the retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our strategies 

changes in market conditions may impact any stock repurchases 

to the extent we engage in stock repurchases such activity is subject to market conditions such as the trading prices for our stock management in its discretion will determine the timing and manner of any repurchases in light of prevailing market conditions our available resources and other factors that cannot be predicted 

adverse results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us 

we are subject to and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty irrespective of its merits litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expenditure and diversion of management attention we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could materially adversely affect a portion of our business operations or materially and adversely affect our financial position and our results of operations should we fail to prevail in certain matters 

we may not be able to fully or successfully implement our ongoing plans to improve and globally integrate our business processes and functions 

we continue to seek ways to drive greater productivity flexibility and cost savings in particular we are working towards the improvement and global integration of our business processes and functions as part of 

  

these efforts we have been centralizing certain functions implementing new information technology and integrating our existing information technology systems 

our ongoing implementation of organizational improvements is made more difficult by our need to coordinate geographically dispersed operations inabilities and delays in implementing improvements can negatively affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings in addition the process of organizational improvements may cause interruptions of or loss of momentum in the activities of our businesses it may also result in the loss of personnel or other labor issues these issues as well as any information technology systems failures also could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 

additionally from time to time certain aspects of our business processes may be outsourced to third parties the processes or the portions thereof that are outsourced generally will tend to be labor intensive transactional activities although we make a diligent effort to ensure that all providers of outsourced services observe proper internal control practices and procedures we cannot assure that failures will not occur the failure of such third parties to provide adequate services could adversely affect our results of operations liquidity or our ability to provide adequate financial and management reporting 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may adversely affect the valuation of pension obligations the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets may result in corresponding increases and decreases in the value of plan assets particularly equity securities or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets any change in key actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate would impact the valuation of pension obligations affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years 

certain of our current pension plans could have projected benefit obligations that exceed the fair value of the plan assets as of december 31 2014 the aggregate deficit was 953 million any declines in the fair values of the pension plans assets could require additional payments by us in order to maintain specified funding levels 

our pension plans are subject to legislative and regulatory requirements of applicable jurisdictions which could include under certain circumstances local governmental authority to terminate the plan 

our operations could be adversely affected by labor relations 

the vast majority of our employees located in europe and south america are represented by labor unions and works councils approximately 820 of our employees located in north america are represented by labor unions 

our operations have been in the past and may be in the future significantly and adversely affected by strikes work stoppages and other labor disputes

 intellectual property 

we maintain an extensive patent portfolio and continue to file new patent applications in the us and other countries as of december 31 2014 we owned approximately 5000 patents and patent applications worldwide our patents and trade secrets cover our processes products and catalysts and are significant to our competitive position particularly with regard to po intermediate chemicals petrochemicals polymers and our process 

  

technologies we own globally registered and unregistered trademarks including the “lyondellbasell” “lyondell” and “equistar” trade names while we believe that our intellectual property provides competitive advantages we do not regard our businesses as being materially dependent upon any single patent trade secret or trademark some of our heritage production capacity operates under licenses from third parties 

environmental 

most of our operations are affected by national state regional and local environmental laws matters pertaining to the environment are discussed in part i item 1a risk factors  part i item 3 legal proceedings  part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation s and notes 2 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

we have made and intend to continue to make the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to environmental health and safety matters we incurred capital expenditures of 114 million in 2014 for health safety and environmental compliance purposes and improvement programs and estimate such expenditures to be approximately 190 million in each of 2015 and 2016 

while capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance including compliance with potential legislation and potential regulation related to climate change cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe they will have a material effect on our competitive position 

while there can be no assurance that physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future we have reviewed the potential for these risks and have concluded that because of our facility locations and our existing distribution networks we do not believe these risks are material in the near term 

employee relations 

as of december 31 2014 we employed approximately 13100 fulltime and parttime employees around the world of these approximately 6000 were in each of north america and europe with the remainder in other locations 

as of december 31 2014 approximately 820 of our employees in north america were represented by labor unions the vast majority of our employees in europe and south america are subject to staff council or works council coverage or collective bargaining agreements approximately 55 of our unionized north american employees working at the company’s houston refinery were covered by a collective bargaining agreement cba between the company and the united steelworkers union usw which became effective february 1 2012 and expired february 1 2015 at 1201am leading up to the expiration of the cba we negotiated diligently and in good faith with the usw but were notified immediately before the cba expiration date that the international usw had called our employees to strike we remain committed to negotiating in good faith for a fair and responsible contract 

in addition to our own employees we use the services of contractors in the routine conduct of our businesses

other locations and properties 

we maintain executive offices in london the united kingdom rotterdam the netherlands and houston texas we maintain research facilities in lansing michigan channelview texas cincinnati ohio ferrara italy and frankfurt germany our asia pacific headquarters are in hong kong we also have technical support centers in bayreuth germany geelong australia and tarragona spain we have various sales facilities worldwide 

website access to sec reports 

our internet website address is httpwwwlybcom  information contained on our internet website is not part of this report on form 10k 

our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 are available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are filed with or furnished to the us securities and exchange commission alternatively you may access these reports at the sec’s website at httpwwwsecgov 

 

 you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 

our business including our results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected by safety or product liability issues 

failure to appropriately manage safety human health product liability and environmental risks associated with our products product life cycles and production processes could adversely impact employees communities stakeholders our reputation and our results of operations public perception of the risks associated with our products and production processes could impact product acceptance and influence the regulatory environment in which we operate while we have procedures and controls to manage safety risks issues could be created by events outside of our control including natural disasters severe weather events and acts of sabotage 

our operations are subject to risks inherent in chemical and refining businesses and we could be subject to liabilities for which we are not fully insured or that are not otherwise mitigated 

we maintain property business interruption product general liability casualty and other types of insurance that we believe are in accordance with customary industry practices however we are not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to our business including losses resulting from natural disasters wars or terrorist acts changes in insurance market conditions have caused and may in the future cause premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies to increase substantially and in some instances for certain insurance to become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured we might not be able to finance the amount of the uninsured liability on terms acceptable to us or at all and might be obligated to divert a significant portion of our cash flow from normal business operations 

further because a part of our business involves licensing polyolefin process technology our licensees are exposed to similar risks involved in the manufacture and marketing of polyolefins hazardous incidents involving our licensees if they do result or are perceived to result from use of our technologies may harm our reputation threaten our relationships with other licensees andor lead to customer attrition and financial losses our policy of covering these risks through contractual limitations of liability and indemnities and through 

  

insurance may not always be effective as a result our financial condition and results of operation would be adversely affected and other companies with competing technologies may have the opportunity to secure a competitive advantage 

our ability to source raw materials including crude oil may be adversely affected by political instability civil disturbances or other governmental actions 

we obtain a substantial portion of our principal raw materials from sources in north africa the middle east mexico and south america that may be less politically stable than other areas in which we conduct business such as europe or the us political instability civil disturbances and actions by governments in these areas are likely to substantially increase the price and decrease the supply of raw materials necessary for our operations which will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

recently increased incidents of civil unrest including terrorist attacks and demonstrations that have been marked by violence have occurred in a number of countries in north africa and the middle east some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest political instability and civil unrest could continue to spread in the region and involve other areas such unrest if it continues to spread or grow in intensity could lead to civil wars regional conflicts or regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to countries in which we conduct substantial business such as in europe the us or their respective allies 

a substantial decrease in the price of crude oil may adversely impact our results of operations 

energy costs generally follow price trends of crude oil and natural gas these price trends may be highly volatile and cyclical in the past raw material and energy costs have experienced significant fluctuations that adversely affected our business segments’ results of operations for example we continue to benefit from the favorable ratio of us natural gas prices to crude oil prices however if the price of crude oil decreases relative to us natural gas prices or if the demand for natural gas and ngls increases this may have a negative result on our results of operations 

costs and limitations on supply of raw materials and energy may result in increased operating expenses 

the costs of raw materials and energy represent a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to the significant competition we face and the commodity nature of many of our products we are not always able to pass on raw material and energy cost increases to our customers when we do have the ability to pass on the cost increases we are not always able to do so quickly enough to avoid adverse impacts on our results of operations 

cost increases for raw materials also may increase working capital needs which could reduce our liquidity and cash flow even if we increase our sales prices to reflect rising raw material and energy costs demand for products may decrease as customers reduce their consumption or use substitute products which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition producers in natural gas costadvantaged regions such as the middle east and north america benefit from the lower prices of natural gas and ngls competition from producers in these regions may cause us to reduce exports from europe and elsewhere any such reductions may increase competition for product sales within europe and other markets which can result in lower margins in those regions 

for some of our raw materials and utilities there are a limited number of suppliers and in some cases the supplies are specific to the particular geographic region in which a facility is located it is also common in the chemical and refining industries for a facility to have a sole dedicated source for its utilities such as steam electricity and gas having a sole or limited number of suppliers may limit our negotiating power particularly in the case of rising raw material costs any new supply agreements we enter into may not have terms as favorable as those contained in our current supply agreements 

additionally there is growing concern over the reliability of water sources including around the texas gulf coast where several of our facilities are located the decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of population growth drought or regulation could negatively impact our operations 

  

if our raw material or utility supplies were disrupted our businesses may incur increased costs to procure alternative supplies or incur excessive downtime which would have a direct negative impact on plant operations disruptions of supplies may occur as a result of transportation issues including but not limited to as a result of natural disasters and water levels that can affect the operations of vessels barges rails trucks and pipeline traffic these risks are particularly prevalent in the us gulf coast area additionally the export of ngls from the us greater restrictions on hydraulic fracturing or the lifting by the us government of the ban on us crude oil exports could restrict the availability of our raw materials thereby increasing our costs 

with increased volatility in raw material costs our suppliers could impose more onerous terms on us resulting in shorter payment cycles and increasing our working capital requirements 

economic disruptions and downturns in general and particularly continued economic uncertainty in europe or economic turmoil in emerging markets could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

our results of operations can be materially affected by adverse conditions in the financial markets and depressed economic conditions generally economic downturns in the businesses and geographic areas in which we sell our products substantially reduce demand for our products and result in decreased sales volumes and increased credit risk recessionary environments adversely affect our business because demand for our products is reduced particularly from our customers in industrial markets generally and the automotive and housing industries specifically and may result in higher costs of capital a significant portion of our revenues and earnings are derived from our business in europe including southern europe in addition most of our european transactions and assets including cash reserves and receivables are denominated in euros 

europe’s recovery from the economic crisis has continued to be uneven slow and modest if the crisis reemerges or meaningful recovery does not materialize across europe there will likely be a continued negative effect on our european business as well as the businesses of our european customers suppliers and partners in addition if the crisis leads to a significant devaluation of the euro the value of our financial assets that are denominated in euros would be significantly reduced when translated to us dollars for financial reporting purposes we also derive significant revenues from our business in emerging markets particularly the emerging markets in asia and brazil any broadbased downturn in these emerging markets or in a key market such as china could require us to reduce export volumes into these markets and could also require us to divert product sales to less profitable markets any of these conditions could ultimately harm our overall business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

the cyclicality and volatility of the industries in which we participate may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 

our business operations are subject to the cyclical and volatile nature of the supplydemand balance in the chemical and refining industries our future operating results are expected to continue to be affected by this cyclicality and volatility the chemical and refining industries historically have experienced alternating periods of capacity shortages causing prices and profit margins to increase followed by periods of excess capacity resulting in oversupply declining capacity utilization rates and declining prices and profit margins 

in addition to changes in the supply and demand for products changes in energy prices and other worldwide economic conditions can cause volatility these factors result in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over business cycles 

new capacity additions in asia the middle east and north america may lead to periods of oversupply and lower profitability a sizable number of expansions have been announced in north america the timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions are uncertain and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time as a consequence we are unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of future industry cycles or their effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we sell products in highly competitive global markets and face significant price pressures 

we sell our products in highly competitive global markets due to the commodity nature of many of our products competition in these markets is based primarily on price and to a lesser extent on product performance product quality product deliverability reliability of supply and customer service generally we are not able to protect our market position for these products by product differentiation and may not be able to pass on cost increases to our customers due to the significant competition in our business 

in addition we face increased competition from companies that may have greater financial resources and different cost structures or strategic goals than us these include large integrated oil companies some of which also have chemical businesses governmentowned businesses and companies that receive subsidies or other government incentives to produce certain products in a specified geographic region increased competition from these companies especially in our olefin and refining businesses could limit our ability to increase product sales prices in response to raw material and other cost increases or could cause us to reduce product sales prices to compete effectively which could reduce our profitability competitors that have greater financial resources than us may be able to invest significant capital into their businesses including expenditures for research and development 

in addition specialty products we produce may become commoditized over time increased competition could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 

interruptions of operations at our facilities may result in liabilities or lower operating results 

we own and operate largescale facilities our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our various production facilities and the ability to complete construction and maintenance projects on schedule interruptions at our facilities may materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or our business as a whole during and after the period of such operational difficulties in the past we had to shut down plants on the us gulf coast including the temporary shutdown of our houston refinery as a result of hurricanes striking the texas coast 

in addition because the houston refinery is our only refining operation an outage at the refinery could have a particularly negative impact on our operating results unlike our chemical and polymer production facilities which may have sufficient excess capacity to mitigate the negative impact of lost production at other facilities we do not have the ability to increase refining production elsewhere in the us 

although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions our operations are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and refining and the related storage and transportation of raw materials products and wastes these potential hazards include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or personal injury and loss of life and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities 

increased it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products facilities and services 

increased global information security threats and more sophisticated targeted computer crime pose a risk to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data operations and infrastructure while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our employees systems networks products facilities and services remain potentially vulnerable to sophisticated espionage or continual cyberassault depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations 

we operate internationally and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations exchange controls political risks and other risks relating to international operations 

we operate internationally and are subject to the risks of doing business on a global level these risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates economic instability and disruptions restrictions on the transfer of funds and the imposition of duties and tariffs additional risks from our multinational business include transportation delays and interruptions war terrorist activities epidemics pandemics political instability import and export controls changes in governmental policies labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments 

we generate revenues from export sales and operations that may be denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency exchange rates between these currencies and functional currencies in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future we also could hedge certain revenues and costs using derivative instruments to minimize the impact of changes in the exchange rates of those currencies compared to the respective functional currencies it is possible that fluctuations in exchange rates will result in reduced operating results additionally we operate with the objective of having our worldwide cash available in the locations where it is needed including the united kingdom for our parent company’s significant cash obligations as a result of dividend and interest payments it is possible that we may not always be able to provide cash to other jurisdictions when needed or that such transfers of cash could be subject to additional taxes including withholding taxes 

our operating results could be negatively affected by the global laws rules and regulations as well as political environments in the jurisdictions in which we operate there could be reduced demand for our products decreases in the prices at which we can sell our products and disruptions of production or other operations 

  

additionally there may be substantial capital and other costs to comply with regulations andor increased security costs or insurance premiums any of which could reduce our operating results 

we obtain a substantial portion of our principal raw materials from international sources that are subject to these same risks our compliance with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject could be challenged furthermore these laws may be modified the result of which may be to prevent or limit subsidiaries from transferring cash to us 

furthermore we are subject to certain existing and may be subject to possible future laws that limit or may limit our activities while some of our competitors may not be subject to such laws which may adversely affect our competitiveness 

changes in tax laws and regulations could affect our tax rate and our results of operations 

we are a tax resident in the united kingdom and are subject to the united kingdom corporate income tax system however as a holding company our tax obligations are primarily incurred in the various jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate recently there has been an increase in attention both in the us and in europe to the tax practices of multinational companies such attention may result in legislative changes that could affect our tax rate in addition certain jurisdictions in which we conduct business and incur a tax liability are considering proposals to change their tax laws while we are not aware of any impending changes to legislation or tax regulations any change in our tax rate would impact our results of operations 

failure to comply with the foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws may have an adverse effect on us 

our international operations require us to comply with a number of us and international laws and regulations including those involving antibribery and anticorruption in order to effectively operate in certain foreign jurisdictions circumstances may require that we establish joint ventures with local operators or find strategic partners as an issuer with securities listed on a united states stock exchange we are subject to the regulations imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa which generally prohibits issuers and their intermediaries including strategic or local partners or agents even if those partners or agents are not themselves subject to the fcpa or other similar laws from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or obtaining an improper business benefit we have an ongoing program to promote compliance with the fcpa and other similar antibribery and anticorruption laws any determination that we have violated the fcpa or other similar laws could have a material effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

many of our businesses depend on our intellectual property our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and our inability to do so could reduce our ability to maintain our competitiveness and margins 

we have a significant worldwide patent portfolio of issued and pending patents these patents together with proprietary technical knowhow are significant to our competitive position particularly with regard to po performance chemicals petrochemicals and polymers including process technologies such as spheripol  spherizone  hostalen  spherilene  lupotech t and avant catalyst family technology rights we rely on the patent copyright and trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing however we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without authorization proceedings to protect these rights could be costly and we may not prevail 

the protection afforded by patents varies from country to country and depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage while a presumption of validity exists with respect to patents issued to us our patents may 

  

be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable as patents expire the products and processes described and claimed under those patents become generally available for use by competitors 

our continued growth strategy may bring us to regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce in addition patent rights may not prevent our competitors from developing using or selling products that are similar or functionally equivalent to our products moreover our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner which could result in significantly lower revenues reduced profit margins or loss of market share 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary knowhow and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property these confidentiality agreements may be breached may not always be executed may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies may not be available additionally others could obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal or illegal means 

the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes apparatuses technology trade secrets or proprietary knowhow could result in significantly lower revenues reduced profit margins and cash flows andor loss of market share we also may be subject to claims that our technology patents or other intellectual property infringes on a third party’s intellectual property rights unfavorable resolution of these claims could result in restrictions on our ability to deliver the related service or in a settlement that could be material to us 

shared control or lack of control of joint ventures may delay decisions or actions regarding the joint ventures 

a portion of our operations are conducted through joint ventures where control may be exercised by or shared with unaffiliated third parties we cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners including any nonperformance default or bankruptcy of joint venture partners the joint ventures that we do not control may also lack adequate internal controls systems or financial reporting systems to provide adequate and timely information for our reporting purposes 

in the event that any of our joint venture partners do not observe their obligations it is possible that the affected joint venture would not be able to operate in accordance with our business plans as a result we could be required to increase our level of commitment in order to give effect to such plans differences in views among the joint venture participants also may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major matters potentially adversely affecting the business and operations of the joint ventures and in turn our business and operations 

we cannot predict with certainty the extent of future costs under environmental health and safety and other laws and regulations and cannot guarantee they will not be material 

we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture handle or own in addition because our products are components of a variety of other enduse products we along with other members of the chemical industry are subject to potential claims related to those enduse products any substantial increase in the success of these types of claims could negatively affect our operating results 

we together with the industries in which we operate are subject to extensive national regional state and local environmental laws regulations directives rules and ordinances concerning 

 

  

   

 many of these laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations in addition some of these laws and regulations require us to meet specific financial responsibility requirements any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

although we have compliance programs and other processes intended to ensure compliance with all such regulations we are subject to the risk that our compliance with such regulations could be challenged noncompliance with certain of these regulations could result in the incurrence of additional costs penalties or assessments that could be material 

our industry is subject to extensive government regulation and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures 

compliance with regulatory requirements could result in higher operating costs such as regulatory requirements relating to emissions the security of our facilities and the transportation export or registration of our products we generally expect that regulatory controls worldwide will become increasingly more demanding but cannot accurately predict future developments 

increasingly strict environmental laws and inspection and enforcement policies could affect the handling manufacture use emission or disposal of products other materials or hazardous and nonhazardous waste stricter environmental safety and health laws regulations and enforcement policies could result in increased operating costs or capital expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations additionally we are required to have permits for our businesses and are subject to licensing regulations these permits and licenses are subject to renewal modification and in some circumstances revocation further the permits and licenses are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

we may incur substantial costs to comply with climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives 

there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas “ghg” reduction these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future laws in this field continue to evolve and while they are likely to be increasingly widespread and stringent at this stage it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation within the framework of the eu emissions trading scheme “ets” we were allocated certain allowances of carbon dioxide for the affected plants of our european sites for the period from 2008 to 2012 “ets ii period” the ets ii period did not bring additional cost to us as the allowance allocation was sufficient to cover the actual emissions of the affected plants we were able to build an allowance surplus during the ets ii period which has been banked to the scheme for the period from 2013 to 2020 “ets iii period” we expect to incur additional costs for the ets iii period despite the allowance surplus accrued over the ets ii period as allowance allocations have been reduced for the ets iii period and more of our plants are affected by the scheme we maintain an active hedging strategy to cover these additional costs we expect to incur additional costs in relation to future carbon or ghg emission trading schemes 

in the us the environmental protection agency the “epa” has promulgated federal ghg regulations under the clean air act affecting certain sources the epa has issued mandatory ghg reporting requirements requirements to obtain ghg permits for certain industrial plants and proposals for ghg performance standards for some facilities the recent epa action could be a precursor to further federal regulation of carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases and may affect the outcome of other climate change lawsuits pending in 

  

us courts in a manner unfavorable to our industry in any event additional regulation may be forthcoming at the us federal or state level with respect to ghg emissions and such regulation could result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances 

compliance with these or other changes in laws regulations and obligations that create a ghg emissions trading scheme or ghg reduction policies generally could significantly increase our costs or reduce demand for products we produce additionally compliance with these regulations may result in increased permitting necessary for the operation of our business or for any of our growth plans difficulties in obtaining such permits could have an adverse effect on our future growth therefore any future potential regulations and legislation could result in increased compliance costs additional operating restrictions or delays in implementing growth projects or other capital investments and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may be required to record material charges against our earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets 

we may be required to reduce production at or idle facilities for extended periods of time or exit certain businesses as a result of the cyclical nature of our industry specifically oversupplies of or lack of demand for particular products or high raw material prices may cause us to reduce production we may choose to reduce production at certain facilities because we have offtake arrangements at other facilities which make any reductions or idling unavailable at those facilities any decision to permanently close facilities or exit a business likely would result in impairment and other charges to earnings 

temporary outages at our facilities can last for several quarters and sometimes longer these outages could cause us to incur significant costs including the expenses of maintaining and restarting these facilities in addition even though we may reduce production at facilities we may be required to continue to purchase or pay for utilities or raw materials under takeorpay supply agreements 

our business is capital intensive and we rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and ongoing capital needs limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results 

we require significant capital to operate our current business and fund our growth strategy moreover interest payments dividends and the expansion of our business or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital we believe that our cash from operations currently will be sufficient to meet these needs however if we need external financing our access to credit markets and pricing of our capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies and the state of the capital markets generally there can be no assurances that we would be able to incur indebtedness on terms we deem acceptable and it is possible that the cost of any financings could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities which could adversely affect our operating results 

we may use our fiveyear 2 billion revolving credit facility which backs our commercial paper program to meet our cash needs to the extent available as of december 31 2014 we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the facility and 262 million outstanding under our commercial paper program leaving an unused and available credit capacity of 1712 million we may also meet our cash needs by selling receivables under our 1000 million us accounts receivable securitization facility or our €450 million european accounts receivable securitization facility in the event of a default under our credit facility or any of our senior notes we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do any default under any of our credit arrangements could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments 

  

without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate 

legislation and regulatory initiatives could lead to a decrease in demand for our products 

new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health safety and the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products initiatives by governments and private interest groups will potentially require increased toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us for example in the united states the national toxicology program “ntp” is a federal interagency program that seeks to identify and select for study chemicals and other substances to evaluate potential human health hazards in the european union the regulation on registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals “reach” is regulation designed to identify the intrinsic properties of chemical substances assess hazards and risks of the substances and identify and implement the risk management measures to protect humans and the environment 

assessments under ntp reach or similar programs or regulations in other jurisdictions may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals we use or produce and may result in additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of those chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the identification and development of talent to succeed senior management 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and we rely heavily on our management team the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations in addition because of the reliance on our management team our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management the retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our strategies 

changes in market conditions may impact any stock repurchases 

to the extent we engage in stock repurchases such activity is subject to market conditions such as the trading prices for our stock management in its discretion will determine the timing and manner of any repurchases in light of prevailing market conditions our available resources and other factors that cannot be predicted 

adverse results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us 

we are subject to and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty irrespective of its merits litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expenditure and diversion of management attention we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could materially adversely affect a portion of our business operations or materially and adversely affect our financial position and our results of operations should we fail to prevail in certain matters 

we may not be able to fully or successfully implement our ongoing plans to improve and globally integrate our business processes and functions 

we continue to seek ways to drive greater productivity flexibility and cost savings in particular we are working towards the improvement and global integration of our business processes and functions as part of 

  

these efforts we have been centralizing certain functions implementing new information technology and integrating our existing information technology systems 

our ongoing implementation of organizational improvements is made more difficult by our need to coordinate geographically dispersed operations inabilities and delays in implementing improvements can negatively affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings in addition the process of organizational improvements may cause interruptions of or loss of momentum in the activities of our businesses it may also result in the loss of personnel or other labor issues these issues as well as any information technology systems failures also could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 

additionally from time to time certain aspects of our business processes may be outsourced to third parties the processes or the portions thereof that are outsourced generally will tend to be labor intensive transactional activities although we make a diligent effort to ensure that all providers of outsourced services observe proper internal control practices and procedures we cannot assure that failures will not occur the failure of such third parties to provide adequate services could adversely affect our results of operations liquidity or our ability to provide adequate financial and management reporting 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may adversely affect the valuation of pension obligations the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets may result in corresponding increases and decreases in the value of plan assets particularly equity securities or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets any change in key actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate would impact the valuation of pension obligations affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years 

certain of our current pension plans could have projected benefit obligations that exceed the fair value of the plan assets as of december 31 2014 the aggregate deficit was 953 million any declines in the fair values of the pension plans assets could require additional payments by us in order to maintain specified funding levels 

our pension plans are subject to legislative and regulatory requirements of applicable jurisdictions which could include under certain circumstances local governmental authority to terminate the plan 

our operations could be adversely affected by labor relations 

the vast majority of our employees located in europe and south america are represented by labor unions and works councils approximately 820 of our employees located in north america are represented by labor unions 

our operations have been in the past and may be in the future significantly and adversely affected by strikes work stoppages and other labor disputes

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend environmental matters 

from time to time we and our joint ventures receive notices or inquiries from government entities regarding alleged violations of environmental laws and regulations pertaining to among other things the disposal emission and storage of chemical and petroleum substances including hazardous wastes item 103 of the sec’s regulation sk requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and the proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that we reasonably believe could exceed 100000 the matters below are disclosed solely pursuant to that requirement 

in september 2013 the louisiana department of environmental quality the “ldeq” issued a compliance order and notice of potential penalty to equistar chemicals lp pertaining to selfreported deviations arising from our lake charles louisiana polyolefins plant and relating to certain clean air act title v permit conditions limits and other requirements the matter involves deviations reported by us to the ldeq in semiannual reports covering 2007 through june 2011 we reasonably believe that ldeq may assert an administrative penalty demand in this matter in excess of 100000 

in september 2013 epa region v issued a notice and finding of violation alleging violations at our morris illinois facility related to flaring activity the notice generally alleges failures to monitor steam usage and improper flare operations we reasonably believe that epa region v may assert a penalty demand in excess of 100000 

in june 2014 epa region v issued a notice and finding of violation alleging violations at our tuscola illinois facility related to flaring activity the notice generally alleges failure to conduct a valid performance test and improper flare operations we reasonably believe that epa region v may assert a penalty demand in excess of 100000

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend general 

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes elsewhere in this report when we use the terms “we” “us” “our” or similar words in this discussion unless the context otherwise requires we are referring to lyondellbasell industries nv and its consolidated subsidiaries 

references to industry benchmark prices or costs including the weighted average cost of ethylene production are generally to industry prices and costs from thirdparty consulting data references to industry benchmarks for refining and oxyfuels market margins are to industry prices reported by platts a reporting service of the mcgrawhill companies references to industry benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas are to bloomberg 

overview 

our performance is driven by among other things global economic conditions generally and their impact on demand for our products raw material and energy prices as well as industryspecific issues such as production capacity our businesses are generally subject to the cyclicality and volatility seen in the chemicals and refining industries 

we achieved record earnings in 2014 despite the impact of a significant lower of cost or market inventory valuation charge necessitated by the decline in crude oil and correlated product prices in the latter part of the year we believe our industry position remains favorable and are confident in the fundamentals supporting our businesses in 2014 we continued to focus on our backtobasics strategy and high return growth projects some of which are already contributing to earnings 

significant items that affected 2014 results include 

 

  

  

  

 other noteworthy items during 2014 include the following 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 results of operations for the periods discussed in these “results of operations” are presented in the table below 

 

 results of operations 

revenues —we had revenues of 45608 million in 2014 44062 million in 2013 and 45352 million in 2012 

2014 versus 2013— revenues increased by 1546 million or 4 in 2014 compared to 2013 

higher sales volumes for acetyls styrene po and derivatives and refining products which were offset in part by lower volumes for us olefins and eo and derivatives contributed to 4 higher revenues in 2014 compared to 2013 higher acetyls sales volumes in 2014 benefited from the restart of our methanol plant at channelview texas in december 2013 sales volumes for styrene improved in 2014 compared to 2013 which was affected by planned maintenance activities in the us and europe industry outages in europe and asia in 2014 led to higher volumes for po and derivatives an increase in sales volumes of refined products in 2014 reflects higher crude processing rates relative to 2013 which was negatively impacted by planned outages at our houston refinery sales volumes for us polyethylene were favorably affected by firm demand and the completion of an expansion and turnaround of our matagorda texas polyethylene facility these increases were 

  

offset in part by lower us olefin sales volumes as 2014 volumes were impacted by an expansionrelated turnaround at our la porte texas facility unplanned outages in 2014 resulted in lower eo and derivative volumes during that period 

in 2014 higher average sales prices for us polyethylene polypropylene “pp” pp compounds po and derivatives except butanediol “bdo” and vinyl acetate monomer “vam” were offset by lower average sales prices for european polyethylene butanediol oxyfuels c4 chemicals and refining products 

increased demand and industry supply issues in 2014 led to the increase in us polyethylene prices the improvements in polypropylene prices reflected more favorable market conditions in 2014 versus 2013 global industry constraints and limited regional supply led to increased prices for vam and all of our po and derivatives products except butanediol which declined due to excess industry capacity in asia and the middle east the lower average sales prices for oxyfuels in 2014 reflected the impact of lower brent crude oil and gasoline prices which was partially offset by a higher octane blending premium in 2014 the decline in c4 chemicals prices was driven by the lower energy profile while the average sales prices for refining products reflected the decline in crude oil prices during the fourth quarter of 2014 

2013 versus 2012— revenues decreased 1290 million or 3 in 2013 compared to 2012 lower sales volumes in 2013 contributed 4 to the decrease in revenues over 2012 this decline in sales volumes primarily reflects the negative impact of lower crude processing rates at the houston refinery on refining product volumes which was offset in part by higher olefins sales volumes in our op—americas segment the impact of lower sales volumes was slightly mitigated by the effect of favorable exchange rates which increased revenues by 1 in 2013 over 2012 average sales prices were relatively unchanged in 2013 compared to 2012 

cost of sales —cost of sales were 38939 million in 2014 37940 million in 2013 and 39595 million in 2012 

2014 versus 2013— cost of sales increased by 999 million in 2014 compared to 2013 noncash lcm charges related to inventories in all but our technology segment were responsible for 760 million of the 999 million increase in cost of sales these charges which were recognized in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 were primarily driven by declines in the prices of crude oil and products derived from or correlated to crude oil 

excluding these lcm adjustments cost of sales increased 239 million in 2014 over 2013 primarily due to the impact of the higher sales volumes discussed above this volume impact was reduced by the lower cost of crude oil and by the lower cost of ethylene production in the us and europe in 2014 compared to 2013 

2013 versus 2012— cost of sales declined by 1655 million in 2013 compared to 2012 cost of sales in 2012 included benefits totaling 152 million from insurance proceeds associated with a 2008 hurricane a recovery related to a former employee who pled guilty to fraud and the reversal of a reserve for an unfavorable monomer contract these 2012 benefits were offset in part by charges totaling 97 million for reorganization activities in europe facility closure costs in australia and italy and the impairment of a low density polyethylene “ldpe” plant in europe 

apart from these factors cost of sales was lower in 2013 than in 2012 primarily due the impact of lower sales volumes discussed above and lower feedstock costs a shift to cracking more natural gas liquids “ngls” in our op—americas segment increased benefits from lpg cracking and the lower cost of naphtha in our op—eai segment and lower crude oil costs in our refining segment were the most significant contributors to our lower feedstock costs in 2013 these benefits were offset in part by the higher costs of renewable identification numbers “rins” and natural gas in our refining segment and the higher costs of propylene benzene and natural gas feedstocks in our id segment 

operating income —our operating income was 5736 million 5102 million and 4676 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

  

2014 versus 2013— operating income increased by 634 million in 2014 which includes the impact of the 760 million lcm inventory valuation adjustment discussed above this increase primarily reflects the impact of the higher sales volumes discussed above and margins that benefited from lower feedstock costs 

apart from the lcm adjustment margins were higher in 2014 across all businesses in our op—americas and op—eai segments for po and derivatives acetyls and oxyfuels in our id segment and for refining products in our refining segment these higher margins were offset in part by lower margins for c4 chemicals styrene and eo and derivatives in our id segment our higher margins generally reflected our lower cost of ethylene production and the lower cost of crude oil but in some cases were driven by average sales prices that increased relative to the related feedstock costs lower margins for styrene and eo and derivatives reflected lower average sales prices compounded by higher feedstock costs and the lower c4 chemicals margins are attributed to falling energy prices 

2013 versus 2012— the increase in 2013 operating income reflects higher margins offset in part by the decline in volumes and the items specific to 2012 discussed above the lower average cost of feedstocks led to the improvement in margins in 2013 as average sales prices were relatively unchanged compared to 2012 

the higher margins in 2013 were related to olefins and polyethylene in our op—americas and op—eai segments and styrene ethylene oxideethylene glycol “eoeg” and acetyls in our id segment these improvements were partially offset by lower refining margins in our refining segment and lower margins for oxyfuels bdo and solvents in our id segment 

operating results for each of our business segments are reviewed further in the “segment analysis” section below 

interest expense —interest expense was 352 million in 2014 309 million in 2013 and 655 million in 2012 

2014 versus 2013— the increase in interest expense in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to interest related to the july 2013 issuances of our 4 guaranteed notes due 2023 and 525 guaranteed notes due 2043 and the february 2014 issuance of our 4875 guaranteed notes due 2044 these increases were partially offset by a 28 million net favorable adjustment related to our fixedforfloating interest rate swaps see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these swaps 

2013 versus 2012— interest expense was lower in 2013 compared to 2012 largely due to the refinancing of most of our longterm debt to lower coupon notes and the termination of our us assetbased credit facility in 2012 in connection with the refinancing we paid 294 million of premiums and wrote off 18 million of unamortized debt issuance costs we also wrote off 17 million of capitalized debt issuance costs as a result of the termination of our us assetbased credit facility the benefit of lower interest expense from the refinancing was partially offset in 2013 by interest related to the issuance of our 4 notes due 2023 and 525 notes due 2043 discussed above 

other income expense net —we had other income net of 38 million in 2014 other expense net of 15 million in 2013 and other income net of 6 million in 2012 

2014 versus 2013— the improvement in other income net in 2014 compared to 2013 reflects a 20 million benefit related to foreign exchange gains in 2014 versus losses in 2013 approximately 13 million of dividends from investments accounted for using the cost basis and the absence of the 16 million loss incurred in 2013 when we sold our investment in the nihon oxirane company 

2013 versus 2012— the increase in other expense net in 2013 versus 2012 primarily reflects the 16 million loss we incurred on the sale of our investment in the nihon oxirane company 

income from equity investments —our income from equity investments was 257 million in 2014 203 million in 2013 and 143 million in 2012 

  

2014 versus 2013— our 2014 income from equity investments increased by 54 million over 2013 this improvement includes higher margins for some of our joint ventures in the middle east europe and asia the impact of better operating rates at two of our joint ventures in asia and one of our joint ventures in the middle east that experienced significant unplanned maintenance in 2013 in 2014 an improved supply of feedstock at one our asian joint ventures also contributed to the higher operating rates relative to 2013 

2013 versus 2012— the 60 million increase in income from equity investments in 2013 reflected higher margins and improved operations from our joint ventures in the middle east and asia these benefits were offset in part by a 10 million impairment of our noc asia ltd joint venture for additional information related to this impairment see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements operations improved in 2013 at our alwaha petrochemicals ltd “alwaha” joint venture as a result of turnaround activities there in 2012 results for 2012 were also negatively affected by planned maintenance activities at our hmc polymers company ltd joint venture and unplanned outages at our alwaha joint venture 

income taxes —our effective income tax rates of 270 in 2014 227 in 2013 and 317 in 2012 resulted in tax provisions of 1540 million 1136 million and 1327 million respectively our effective income tax rate fluctuates based on among other factors changes in pretax income in countries with varying statutory tax rates the amount of exempt income the us domestic production activity deduction changes in valuation allowances changes in foreign exchange gainslosses and changes in unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions the foreign exchange gainslosses have a permanent impact on our effective income tax rate that can cause unpredictable movement in our effective income tax rate we continue to maintain valuation allowances in various jurisdictions totaling 134 million which could impact our effective tax rate in the future 

2014— the 2014 effective income tax rate which was lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35 was favorably impacted by the amount of exempt income the us domestic production activity deduction foreign exchange losses and a change in the geographic mix of earnings notably an increase in various european countries with lower statutory tax rates and a decrease in the united states pretax income these favorable items were partially offset by the effects of state and local income taxes 

2013— the 2013 effective income tax rate which was lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35 reflected the release of certain valuation allowances and favorable permanent deductions related to exempt income and the us domestic production activity deduction partially offset by the effects of state and local taxes and foreign exchange gains in 2013 we released valuation allowances primarily associated with tax losses in our french tax group resulting in an overall benefit of 353 million 

2012 —the 2012 effective income tax rate which was lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35 reflected the release of certain valuation allowances and favorable permanent deductions related to exempt income and the us domestic production activity deduction partially offset by the effects of state and local taxes 

for further information related to our income taxes see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

comprehensive income— we had comprehensive income of 3052 million in 2014 4364 million in 2013 and 2864 million in 2012 

2014 versus 2013— comprehensive income decreased by 1312 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to foreign currency translation losses and actuarial losses related to our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that were recognized during the period these losses were offset in part by the increase in 2014 net income over 2013 the predominant functional currency for our operations outside of the us is the euro relative to the us dollar the value of the euro decreased in 2014 versus 2013 resulting in foreign currency translation losses which decreased comprehensive income by 958 million in 2014 we 

  

recognized net actuarial losses of 493 million which compares to a net actuarial gain of 411 million recognized in 2013 this 904 million decline in 2014 reflects 663 million related to discount rate assumption changes and other immaterial liability experience gains and losses and 241 million primarily related to actual asset return in excess of the expected return compared to 2013 

2013 versus 2012— comprehensive income increased by 1500 million in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to higher net income and lower actuarial losses related to our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans and to a lesser extent gains on foreign currency translations in 2013 we recognized a net actuarial gain of 411 million which compares to a net actuarial loss of 198 million recognized in 2012 this 609 million improvement in 2013 reflects 515 million related to discount rate assumption changes and other immaterial liability experience gains and losses and 94 million related to actual asset return in excess of the expected return compared to 2012 relative to the us dollar the value of the euro increased in 2013 versus 2012 resulting in higher foreign currency translation gains which contributed 88 million to the increase in comprehensive income

segment analysis 

we use earnings before interest income taxes and depreciation and amortization “ebitda” as our measure of profitability for segment reporting purposes this measure of segment operating results is used by our chief operating decision maker to assess the performance of and allocate resources to our operating segments intersegment eliminations and items that are not directly related or allocated to business operations are included in “other” for additional information related to our operating segments as well as a reconciliation of ebitda to its nearest generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” measure income from continuing operations before income taxes see note 22 segment and related information  to our consolidated financial statements 

  

our continuing operations are divided into five reportable segments op—americas op—eai id refining and technology the following tables reflect selected financial information for our reportable segments 

 

 olefins and polyolefins—americas segment 

overview —in calculating the impact of margin and volume on ebitda consistent with industry practice management offsets revenues and volumes related to ethylene coproducts against the cost to produce ethylene volume and price impacts of ethylene coproducts are reported in margin ethylene is a major building block of our olefins and polyolefins businesses and as such management assesses the performance of the segment based on ethylene sales volumes and prices and our internal cost of ethylene production 

2014 versus 2013— segment results were higher in 2014 primarily due to improved polyethylene and olefins results and to a lesser extent higher polypropylene margins margin improvements and higher sales volumes in 2014 contributed to the increase in polyethylene results over 2013 our 2014 olefins results reflected higher margins relative to 2013 offset in part by lower sales volumes from the outage at our la porte texas facility prior to the completion of an 800 million pound ethylene expansion in september 2014 our segment results were negatively impacted by a 279 million noncash lcm inventory valuation adjustment most of which was recognized in the fourth quarter absent this lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment our fourth quarter 2014 segment results would have been similar to our strong third quarter 2014 results 

prices for heavy liquids ngls and olefins declined significantly in december 2014 in many cases to levels that have not been seen in recent years the price levels for these products were lower than the carrying value of our related inventories as of december 31 2014 requiring us to record the lcm inventory valuation adjustment discussed above 

  

ethylene produced from ngls in north america has been much lower in cost than that produced from crude oilbased liquids naphtha and other crude oilbased liquids are the predominant feedstocks in the rest of the world margins in our olefins and polyethylene businesses in 2014 2013 and 2012 have benefited from this advantage though that benefit may be diminished should the recent lower prices of naphtha and other crudeoil based liquids continue or decline further in such an event our olefins and polyethylene margins may be reduced from the record levels of 2014 

2013 versus 2012— stronger segment earnings in 2013 primarily reflected improved olefins and polyethylene results over 2012 olefins results in 2013 benefited from a decrease in our cost to produce ethylene and from higher sales volumes polyethylene results also improved on higher margins while polypropylene results declined on modestly lower margins 

ethylene raw materials —benchmark crude oil and natural gas prices generally have been indicators of the level and direction of the movement of raw material and energy costs for ethylene and its coproducts in the op—americas segment ethylene and its coproducts are produced from two major raw material groups 

 

  

 although prices of these raw materials are generally related to crude oil and natural gas prices during specific periods the relationships among these materials and benchmarks may vary significantly in the us we have significant capability to change the mix of raw materials used in the production of ethylene and its coproducts to take advantage of the relative costs of heavy liquids and ngls 

production economics for the industry favored ngls during 2014 2013 and 2012 as a result we increased our use of ngls and reduced liquids consumption at our us plants in each year since 2011 approximately 90 of our us ethylene production was produced from ngls in each of 2014 and 2013 while in 2012 we produced approximately 85 of our ethylene from ngls 

  

the following table shows the average us benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas for the applicable periods as well as benchmark us sales prices for ethylene and propylene which we produce and sell or consume internally the table also shows the discounted us benchmark prices for certain polyethylene and polypropylene products these industry benchmark prices are third party estimates that are indicative of contract sales for some key product grades but do not necessarily describe price trends for our full olefins or polymers product mixes the benchmark weighted average cost of ethylene production which reflects credits for coproduct sales is based on a third party consultant’s estimated ratio of heavy liquid raw materials and ngls used in us ethylene production 

 

 the following table sets forth selected financial information for the op—americas segment including income from equity investments which is a component of ebitda 

 

 revenues —revenues increased by 859 million or 7 in 2014 compared to 2013 and 155 million or 1 in 2013 compared to 2012 

2014 versus 2013— the 859 million increase in revenues in 2014 is the result of higher average sales prices and higher sales volumes which account for 6 and 1 respectively of the increase over 2013 average sales prices in 2014 were higher across most products particularly polyethylene higher average polyethylene prices in 2014 reflect increased demand and industry supply issues in the ethylene and polyethylene market average polypropylene prices also improved in 2014 reflecting a market environment that was more favorable than in 2013 

the increase in sales volumes in 2014 was primarily due to higher polyethylene sales volumes offset in part by lower ethylene volumes higher polyethylene sales volumes reflect the completion of an expansionrelated turnaround at our matagorda texas facility in the early part of 2014 and strong industry demand firm market demand throughout 2014 also contributed to the increase in polyethylene sales volumes over 2013 ethylene volumes were negatively impacted by production constraints as a result of the turnaround at our la porte texas facility during 2014 polypropylene sales volumes were relatively unchanged between the 2014 and 2013 periods 

  

2013 versus 2012— in 2013 a 2 increase in revenues attributable to higher olefins sales volumes was partly offset by a 1 revenue decrease stemming from lower average sales prices an increase in 2013 coproduct sales volumes particularly propylene and butadiene more than offset the decline in ethylene volumes during that period the decrease in 2013 revenues attributable to lower average sales prices primarily reflects lower average sales prices for ethylene and butadiene partly offset by higher average sales prices for polyolefins polyethylene sales prices were higher in 2013 largely reflecting supply constraints due to competitor outages while increases in the cost of propylene feedstock led to higher average sales prices for polypropylene 

ebitda —ebitda increased by 338 million or 9 in 2014 compared to 2013 and by 605 million or 20 in 2013 compared to 2012 

2014 versus 2013— the 9 improvement in ebitda during 2014 reflects a 19 increase related to higher margins which was offset in part by a 2 decrease related to volumes and an 8 decrease related to the 279 million lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment discussed above 

margins were higher across all products especially for olefins and polyethylene the combination of higher ethylene sales prices discussed above the lower cost of ngls and heavy liquids and higher coproduct credits resulted in an improvement in olefins margins in 2014 compared to 2013 higher polyethylene margins in 2014 reflect higher average sales prices as discussed above offset in part by increases in ethylene feedstock costs polypropylene margins also improved in 2014 due to the continued strength in pricing that carried over from late 2013 

the decrease in ebitda attributable to the lower volumes reflects a decline in olefins volumes which was partially offset by higher polyethylene volumes 

2013 versus 2012— in 2013 the improvement in ebitda was primarily driven by a 25 increase related to margins this benefit was offset in part by a 4 decrease associated with volumes and a 1 decrease related to a 29 million benefit in 2012 associated with a hurricanerelated insurance settlement 

olefins margins benefited from the lower costs of ngl and heavy liquids feedstock which more than offset the impact of lower average sales prices higher polyethylene margins reflected higher average sales prices and to a lesser extent lower feedstock costs although average sales prices were significantly higher for polypropylene in 2013 this benefit was outpaced by the rising cost of its primary feedstock propylene resulting in modestly lower margins over 2012 

the decline in 2013 ebitda attributed to volumes was largely due to lower ethylene volumes in 2013 relative to 2012 as a result of increased turnaround activity in 2013 

olefins and polyolefins—europe asia international segment 

overview 

2014 versus 2013— operating results in 2014 reflect improved results for our olefins and european polyolefins businesses and to a lesser extent better results for our joint ventures that are accounted for using the equity method higher margins and operating rates which surpassed european average industry rates contributed to the higher olefins results in 2014 the improvement in our polyolefins results in 2014 reflected improved margins versus 2013 and higher polyethylene volumes although market conditions for european producers remain highly competitive the increase in european demand for polyolefins is consistent with the modest overall economic recovery that has been evidenced in the region 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 the declining price of naphtha resulted in a market price lower than the carrying value of our related inventory accordingly we recorded a 44 million noncash lcm inventory 

valuation charge related to our olefins business despite this charge our fourth quarter results remained consistent with our prior quarterly results during 2014 the fall of our product prices lagged behind the decline in feedstock prices throughout the latter part of 2014 

  

2013 versus 2012— although operating results improved in 2013 compared to 2012 market conditions in europe remained weak operating results in 2013 primarily reflected higher results for european olefins and also reflected improved margins in most businesses relative to 2012 results during 2012 were impacted by a scheduled maintenance turnaround at our wesseling germany plant 

ethylene raw materials —in europe heavy liquids are the primary raw materials for our ethylene production during 2014 we significantly increased the consumption of feedstocks other than naphtha such as propane butane and condensates in our production process the prices for these other feedstocks have been subject to declines that are of the same or greater magnitude as the declines in the crude oil prices 

the following table shows the average western europe benchmark prices for brent crude oil for the applicable periods as well as benchmark western europe prices for ethylene and propylene which we produce and consume internally or purchase from unrelated suppliers and discounted prices for certain polyethylene and polypropylene products these industry benchmark prices are third party estimates that are indicative of contract sales for some key product grades but do not necessarily describe price trends for our full olefins or polymers product mixes 

 

 the following table sets forth selected financial information for the op—eai segment including income from equity investments which is a component of ebitda 

 

 revenues —revenues in 2014 increased by 518 million or 4 compared to 2013 and by 164 million or 1 in 2013 compared to 2012 

2014 versus 2013— the increase in 2014 revenues comprises a 2 increase related to higher sales volumes and a 2 increase from higher average sales prices improved operations of our crackers in 2014 versus 2013 resulted in higher output which led to higher olefins sales volumes higher polyethylene sales volumes reflect an increase in our low density polyethylene production capacity relative to 2013 due to operational issues during that time polypropylene sales volumes were lower in 2014 largely due to lower output as a result of turnaround activities at one of our joint ventures during the first quarter of 2014 and the closure of our clyde production facility in australia in late 2013 

in 2014 higher average prices for polypropylene and pp compounds were partially offset by lower average polyethylene prices increases in feedstock costs in 2014 led to the higher polypropylene and pp compounds sales prices compared to 2013 the lower polyethylene prices in 2014 reflect a decline in ethylene feedstock costs primarily in europe 

  

2013 versus 2012— in 2013 a 2 increase in revenues driven by the favorable impact of changes in foreign exchange was partially offset by a 1 decrease stemming from lower average sales prices the decrease in average sales prices was largely attributable to lower sales prices for olefins these prices are generally correlated with the cost of naphtha which decreased during 2013 compared to 2012 sales volumes in 2013 decreased less than 1 from 2012 as a small decrease in olefins volumes was substantially offset by a similar increase in polypropylene sales volumes 

ebitda —ebitda increased by 527 million or 63 in 2014 compared to 2013 and by 291 million or 53 in 2013 compared to 2012 

2014 versus 2013— the 63 improvement in 2014 ebitda included a 51 increase related to margins a 7 increase related to higher volumes and a 7 increase related to improvements in income from our equity investments these increases were partially offset by a 2 decrease related to a net charge of 17 million discussed below in 2014 ebitda included a 52 million benefit associated with a settlement for certain existing and future environmental claims under a 2005 indemnification agreement from an insurance settlement which was offset in part by a 44 million charge related to an lcm adjustment driven by a decline in naphtha prices in 2013 ebitda included a 25 million benefit from an insurance settlement related to the damage to our ldpe plant described below 

the increase in 2014 results was mainly driven by higher earnings in olefins and european polyolefins compared to 2013 higher olefins results reflect margin improvements and the impact of higher volumes discussed above olefin margins were higher primarily due to the combination of the decline in naphtha feedstock prices during the second half of 2014 higher consumption of advantaged feedstocks and increased propylene sales prices driven by tightness in the european market polyethylene results improved during 2014 on higher sales volume as discussed above and on higher spreads primarily due to lower ethylene feedstock costs polypropylene results increased in 2014 over the corresponding prior year period as the margin improvements from higher spreads more than offset the impact of the lower volumes discussed above 

the higher contribution to our results by certain of our joint ventures which is reflected in income from equity investments in 2014 is mainly driven by improved margins compared to 2013 as a result of favorable market price developments during 2014 

2013 versus 2012— the 53 improvement in 2013 ebitda mainly consists of a 28 increase related to margins a 10 improvement related to equity income and a 76 million or 14 net benefit of onetime items in 2013 versus 2012 discussed below the impact on ebitda from the volume change in 2013 versus 2012 was negligible in 2013 ebitda included a 25 million benefit from an insurance settlement related to the damage to our ldpe plant described below in 2012 ebitda included charges of 35 million for restructuring activities in europe 22 million for closure costs in australia and italy and 22 million for impairment of assets related to the damage of our ldpe plant in wesseling germany these 2012 charges were partially offset by a 28 million benefit in 2012 related to the reversal of a reserve for an unfavorable monomer contract 

the increase in 2013 segment results was driven mainly by higher olefins results the higher olefins results reflect higher margins as lower naphtha feedstock costs and the benefit of processing advantaged feedstock during the summer months more than offset lower average sales prices during the period in addition olefins sales price increases in 2012 lagged steep naphtha feedstock cost increases for several months 

excluding the impact of the onetime items discussed above underlying results for polyolefins reflected higher polyethylene margins and an increase in polypropylene volumes pp compounds margins which reflected higher sales prices coupled with decreases in the costs of its key raw material propylene also improved in 2013 relative to 2012 higher margins due to higher average sale prices contributed to the better polybutene1 results in 2013 compared to 2012 

  

the higher contribution to our 2013 results by certain of our joint ventures is largely due to higher margins and improved operations of our joint ventures in the middle east and asia 

intermediates and derivatives segment 

overview 

2014 versus 2013 —operating results for our id segment were slightly lower in 2014 compared to 2013 due to a 93 million noncash lcm inventory valuation adjustment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 this adjustment was a result of the decline of prices for oxyfuels and the raw materials used to produce oxyfuels that fell to levels that were lower than the carrying value of our related inventories at december 31 2014 

absent this inventory valuation adjustment results reflected improvements in acetyls and po and derivatives that were offset in part by lower results for styrene eoeg oxyfuels and c4 chemicals higher acetyls results were primarily driven by the restart of the channelview texas methanol unit in december 2013 industry outages and the delay of announced capacity additions contributed to the higher po and derivatives results in 2014 lower results for styrene in 2014 were driven by excess supply and higher feedstock prices compared to 2013 unplanned maintenance in the last half of the year contributed to our lower eoeg results in 2014 the decrease in oxyfuels and c4 chemicals results reflected the impact of lower oxyfuels sales volumes that was partially offset by slightly higher margins 

2013 versus 2012 —our id operating results for 2013 were lower relative to 2012 mainly due to a decline in oxyfuels results from the exceptionally strong results reported in 2012 additions to bdo industry capacity and raw material increases during 2013 contributed to a decline in our po derivative results improved results for styrene acetyls and eoeg in 2013 were driven by higher margins as compared to 2012 results were also negatively impacted during the 2013 period by scheduled maintenance at our facilities in the us and europe 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the id segment including income from equity investments which is a component of ebitda in addition the table shows methyl tertiary butyl ether “mtbe” margins in northwest europe “nwe” 

 

 revenues —revenues for 2014 increased by 658 million or 7 compared to 2013 and decreased by 186 million or 2 in 2013 compared to 2012 

2014 versus 2013— sales volumes and average sales prices increased revenues by 6 and 1 respectively in 2014 compared to 2013 

higher sales volumes for acetyls styrene and po were offset in part by lower eo and derivatives and oxyfuels sales volumes the 2014 increase in acetyls sales volumes was primarily driven by the december 2013 restart of our methanol plant in channelview texas sales volumes for styrene were higher in 2014 as volumes in 2013 were negatively impacted by planned plant outages at our channelview texas and maasvlakte the netherlands facilities which limited production capacity during that period po sales volumes were higher largely due to industry outages in asia and europe in 2014 due to unplanned outages at our bayport texas facility in 2014 available production capacity was limited which resulted in lower eo derivatives volumes compared to 2013 planned and unplanned production constraints in 2014 were also responsible for lower oxyfuels volumes compared to 2013 

  

in 2014 higher average sales prices for po and derivatives and vam were partially offset by declines in the average sales prices for oxyfuels and c4 chemicals in 2014 compared to 2013 global industry supply constraints and limited regional supply capacity led to higher prices for po and derivatives as well as vam in 2014 compared 2013 oxyfuels sales prices declined in 2014 relative to 2013 with lower brent crude oil and gasoline prices which were partially mitigated by an increase in the octane blend premium octane blend premiums remained strong in 2014 primarily due to industry supply constraints and regionally strong blending demand 

2013 versus 2012— a 4 decrease in revenues in 2013 stemming from lower sales volumes was offset in part by increases in revenue of 1 due to higher average sales prices and 1 from favorable average foreign exchange impacts in 2013 lower sales volumes for po and derivatives and styrene were partially offset by higher oxyfuels and methanol sales volumes compared to 2012 an oversupplied market which more than offset the benefit from nominal demand growth contributed to lower bdo sales volumes in 2013 compared to 2012 turnaround activities in 2013 led to lower styrene volumes during that period improved south american demand resulted in higher oxyfuels sales volumes relative to 2012 the increase in methanol sales volumes was attributable to the restart in december 2013 of our channelview texas methanol plant which had been idled since 2004 

higher average sales prices in 2013 increased revenues by 1 compared to 2012 average sales prices for po increased in 2013 largely due to increases in the price of propylene supply constraints due to industry outages resulted in higher average sales prices for styrene in 2013 compared to 2012 higher demand for methanol due to supply constraints in the middle east and asia coupled with supply constraints for vam in europe led to increases in acetyls sales prices in 2013 over those seen in 2012 these increases were substantially offset by declines in oxyfuels and bdo sales prices oxyfuels sales prices decreased in 2013 reflecting reduced spreads over gasoline relative to a supplyconstrained market in 2012 as well as lower gasoline prices and reduced gasoline spread over butane bdo sales prices also declined due to weak economic conditions and an oversupplied asian market 

ebitda —ebitda decreased by 33 million or 2 in 2014 compared to 2013 and decreased by 129 million or 8 in 2013 compared to 2012 

2014 versus 2013— ebitda decreased in 2014 as a result of the 93 million lcm inventory valuation adjustment in 2014 related to our oxyfuels business which represented a 6 decrease in ebitda compared to 2013 the impact of this charge was offset in part by a 2 increase in ebitda related to 2013 charges totaling 26 million associated with the sale of our investment in nihon oxirane company discussed below in addition to these items a 10 increase in ebitda related to higher volumes was offset in part by a decrease of 8 related to lower margins 

apart from the onetime items discussed above our 2014 results reflected improvements in po and derivatives and acetyls partially offset by lower results for oxyfuels c4 chemicals styrene and eoeg compared to 2013 

improved po and derivatives results for 2014 benefitted from asian startup delays industry outages and european industry supply interruptions these global factors collectively led to higher po sales volumes and increases in average sales prices in 2014 compared to 2013 in addition po and derivatives particularly propylene glycols benefited from the unusually cold weather in early 2014 compared to 2013 

higher acetyls results in 2014 primarily reflect higher methanol volumes due to the restart of our methanol plant in channelview texas in december 2013 combined with improved vam driven by industry outages and a reduction in overall market supply compared to 2013 although operational issues during 2014 limited the benefit derived from the restart of our methanol plant discussed above the plant added approximately 180 million gallons to the overall results during that period improved vam margins in 2014 as increases in average sales prices were partly offset by higher feedstock costs also contributed to the higher acetyls results compared to 2013 

  

the lower oxyfuels results were primarily due to decreases in sales volumes in 2014 as a result of planned and unplanned outages discussed above margins improved moderately in 2014 compared to 2013 as lower brent crude oil and gasoline prices were more than offset by the improved spread between gasoline and crude oil stronger octane blend premiums and lower feedstock prices margins were also negatively impacted by a shift in the level of sales between regions in addition c4 chemicals results declined on falling energy prices 

the decline in styrene results in 2014 compared to 2013 was attributed to lower margins that were partially offset by the impact of the higher sales volumes discussed above styrene margins decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower average sales prices reflecting weak demand and excess capacity and higher benzene and ethylene feedstock prices 

eoeg results in 2014 declined on lower margins and decreases in sales volumes relative to 2013 

2013 versus 2012— the 8 decline in ebitda in 2013 reflected decreases of 5 related to margins the 44 million or 3 net negative impact of the onetime charges in 2013 versus 2012 and a slight decline in volumes 

in 2013 ebitda included a 16 million charge related to the sale of our 40 interest in nihon oxirane company and a 10 million impairment of our investment in our noc asia ltd joint venture see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the sale and impairment of our interests in these joint ventures in 2012 ebitda included an 18 million benefit related to hurricanerelated insurance settlement 

lower results for oxyfuels and po derivatives were offset in part by higher styrene acetyls and eoeg margins oxyfuels results in 2013 reflected lower margins relative to the exceptionally strong margins in 2012 reduced spreads over gasoline relative to a supplyconstrained market in 2012 as well as lower gasoline prices and a reduced gasoline spread over butane contributed to the decrease in oxyfuels margins in 2013 results for po derivatives declined in 2013 primarily due to lower bdo and solvents results an oversupplied asian market which more than offset nominal demand growth resulted in lower sales volumes and weaker margins for bdo in 2013 compared to 2012 

these decreases were partially offset by improved styrene margins due to industry outages which constrained global supply and led to increases in average sales prices in 2013 which outpaced the higher costs of benzene feedstock the improvement in acetyls results reflected the benefit of the restart of our channelview texas methanol plant higher average sales prices and the lower cost of ethylene feedstock the benefits of which were partly offset by higher natural gas costs also contributed to the increase in acetyls results higher margins for eoeg in 2013 reflected a modest increase in average sales prices and lower ethylene feedstock costs 

refining segment 

overview —the refining segment comprises the operations of our full conversion refinery located on the houston ship channel in houston texas the berre refinery which was previously included in the refining segment through the first quarter of 2012 was classified as discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2012 accordingly results of operations for the berre refinery are not included in the segment discussion 

2014 versus 2013— the results of our refining segment in 2014 were significantly impacted by a yearend noncash charge of 344 million to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to market value at december 31 2014 this inventory valuation charge was predicated on a near 50 per barrel decline in crude oil prices since the third quarter of 2014 and corresponding reductions in refined product prices 

fourth quarter 2014 results were markedly lower than results in the prior three quarters of 2014 as refined product margins contracted and the recognition of the lcm inventory valuation adjustment resulted in a loss for the quarter excluding this charge 2014 segment ebitda reflected an increase over 2013 as refining margins improved operating rates were higher and costs for rins a us government established credit used to show compliance in meeting the environmental protection agency’s renewable fuel standard declined by 20 million 

  

2013 versus 2012— lower refining margins in 2013 compared to 2012 reflected decreases in the average differential between light and heavy crude oils lower byproduct values and 87 million of higher costs for rins operating results were unfavorably impacted by lower crude processing rates largely due to turnaround activities operational issues related to our coking units in december 2013 caused a decline in crude processing rates and suboptimal yields in the fourth quarter of 2013 negatively impacting results in 2013 as indicated in our discussion of operating activities included in “financial condition” purchases of intermediate feedstocks for our fluid catalytic cracking unit in december 2013 to replace the feedstocks normally provided by our coking units resulted in a temporary increase in accounts payable as of december 31 2013 

the following table sets forth selected financial information and heavy crude processing rates for the refining segment and the us refining market margins for the applicable periods “lls” is a light crude oil while “maya” is a heavy crude oil 

 

 revenues —revenues were nearly unchanged in 2014 compared to 2013 and decreased by 1593 million or 12 in 2013 compared to 2012 

2014 versus 2013— total revenues increased 12 million on increased sales volume which were nearly offset by lower product prices sales volumes increased 8 in 2014 relative to 2013 on the benefit of near capacity crude processing rates during most of the year processing rates in 2014 reflect an 12 improvement over rates in 2013 which were negatively impacted by planned and unplanned maintenance this increase was offset by a nearly 8 decrease in revenues driven by lower refined product prices attributable to lower crude oil prices in 2014 

2013 versus 2012— lower sales volumes in 2013 contributed 9 to the revenue decrease over 2012 this decrease in sales volumes corresponded to a 9 decrease in 2013 crude processing rates mainly due to a scheduled turnaround during the first quarter of 2013 and unplanned maintenance during the year in 2013 the increased supply of refined products relative to demand is reflected in a 3 decrease in revenues attributable to lower average refined product sales prices 

ebitda —ebitda decreased by 117 million or 64 in 2014 compared to 2013 and decreased by 299 million or 62 in 2013 compared to 2012 

2014 versus 2013— the 344 million lcm inventory valuation adjustment in 2014 represented a 189 decrease in ebitda during the period ebitda was lower in 2014 relative to 2013 by an additional 7 due to a 14 million onetime recovery and settlement in 2013 discussed below in addition to these items our results reflected higher refining margins and higher volumes in 2014 which resulted in increases in ebitda of 98 and 34 respectively 

higher refining margins in 2014 compared to 2013 were generated by improved average differentials between light and heavy crude oils higher spreads between gasoline and diesel products versus light crude improved byproduct spreads to crude oil cost and lower costs for rins 

  

refinery crude oil processing rates in 2014 were maintained near capacity with the exception of rates in the first quarter of 2014 processing rates in the first quarter of 2014 were negatively impacted by temporary reductions in coking capacity due to the repair of equipment necessitated by operational issues experienced in december 2013 planned repairs on a process vessel in april 2014 also resulted in reduced crude processing during that time 

2013 versus 2012— the 62 decline in ebitda in 2013 reflected decreases of 33 related to margins 16 related to volumes and the 63 million or 13 net negative impact of the following onetime items that occurred in 2013 and 2012 in 2013 ebitda included benefits of 14 million related to recoveries and a settlement associated with a former employee who pled guilty to fraud in 2012 ebitda reflected the benefits of a 53 million insurance settlement associated with a hurricane in 2008 and a recovery of 24 million related to the employee fraud matter discussed above 

our refining margins in 2013 which were lower relative to 2012 were impacted by decreases in the average differential between light and heavy crude oils lower byproduct values and higher natural gas and rins costs also negatively impacted our margins in 2013 

crude oil costs at the refinery in 2013 relative to 2012 reflected increased purchases priced in relation to wti and brent crude oils and a lesser amount priced relative to maya which reduced the comparability of our refined product spreads with the maya benchmark product spread 

the lower volumes in 2013 were attributable to the lower crude processing rates stemming from the turnaround activity in the first quarter of 2013 as well as unscheduled maintenance during the year 

technology segment 

overview —the technology segment recognizes revenues related to the sale of polyolefin catalysts licensing of chemical polyolefin and other process technologies and associated engineering and other services these revenues are offset in part by the costs incurred in the production of catalysts licensing and services activities and in research and development “rd” activities in 2014 our technology segment incurred approximately 65 of all rd costs while in the corresponding periods of 2013 and 2012 it incurred approximately 70 of our rd costs 

2014 versus 2013— operating results in 2014 were unchanged compared to 2013 reflecting lower rd expenses and to a lesser extent higher catalyst results offset by lower licensing and services revenues 

2013 versus 2012 —improved operating results in 2013 compared to 2012 reflected higher licensing and services revenues and lower rd expenses technology segment results for 2012 included an 18 million charge related to restructuring activities in europe during that period 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the technology segment 

 

 revenues —revenues decreased by 35 million or 7 in 2014 compared to 2013 and increased by 34 million or 7 in 2013 compared to 2012 

2014 versus 2013— lower licensing and services revenues contributed 7 to the decrease in revenues in 2014 compared to 2013 which benefited from the onetime lumpsum settlement associated with a process license agreement discussed below higher average catalyst sales prices increased revenues by 1 in 2014 while catalyst sales volumes reflected a corresponding decrease compared to the prior year period 

  

2013 versus 2012— higher licensing and services revenues primarily due to a onetime lumpsum settlement in 2013 associated with a process license agreement entered into in a prior year contributed 7 to the increase in 2013 revenues over 2012 lower catalyst sales volumes decreased revenues by 2 while average catalyst sales prices in 2013 remained relatively unchanged from 2012 favorable foreign exchange rates contributed the remaining 2 increase in 2013 revenues 

ebitda —ebitda in 2014 and 2013 were comparable at 232 million and increased by 35 million or 18 in 2013 compared to 2012 

2014 versus 2013— ebitda in 2014 reflects lower rd expenses and moderately higher catalyst results offset by lower licensing and services revenues as discussed above the improvement in 2014 catalyst results over 2013 was the result of higher margins due to higher average sales prices and lower cost 

2013 versus 2012— the improvement in ebitda in 2013 reflects higher licensing and services revenues discussed above and lower rd costs compared to 2012 in 2012 segment results included an 18 million charge related to rd restructuring activities in europe 

financial condition 

operating investing and financing activities of continuing operations which are discussed below are presented in the following table 

 

 operating activities —cash of 6048 million provided in 2014 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items distributions from our joint ventures and refunds totaling 232 million for value added taxes “vat” related to prior periods that were received from italian tax authorities in 2014 these cash inflows were offset in part by cash used by the main components of working capital—accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable 

the main components of working capital used cash of 225 million in 2014 total cash used by the 205 million increase in inventories and by the 378 million decrease in accounts payable was offset in part by a 358 million decline in accounts receivable the increase in inventories primarily reflects higher olefins raw material inventories which were offset in part by lower ethylene and propylene inventories due to turnaround activities at our la porte texas facility and higher levels of inventory for crude oil and workinprocess in our refining segment accounts payable decreased due to lower feedstock costs in 2014 compared to 2013 the decrease in accounts receivable primarily reflects lower ethylene prices in our op—eai segment lower oxyfuels prices in our id segment lower average sales prices and year end volumes in north american polyolefins and lower prices for refining products also contributing to the decline was a larger than usual accounts receivable balance at the end of 2013 attributable to customer remittance timing 

cash of 4835 million provided in 2013 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items proceeds received from italian tax authorities for refunds of vat from prior periods distributions from our joint ventures insurance settlements and cash provided by the main components of working capital these increases were offset in part by company contributions to our pension plans 

  

the main components of working capital provided cash of 60 million in 2013 this reflected increases of 64 million 151 million and 275 million in accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable respectively the increase in inventories was attributable to a build in our op—americas polyethylene inventory at the end of 2013 in preparation for a turnaround scheduled during the first half of 2014 at our la porte texas facility and an increase in crude inventory levels over 2012 levels these increases were partially offset by decreases in our id segment inventories the increase in accounts receivable reflected higher year end op—americas and id segment sales volumes in 2013 compared to 2012 a temporary increase in the purchase of intermediate feedstocks due to operating issues at the houston refinery at the end of 2013 and an increase in payment terms for crude oil purchases in our refining segment were the primary drivers for the increase in accounts payable 

cash of 4787 million provided in 2012 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items proceeds of 306 million received from income tax refunds distributions from our joint ventures insurance settlements and cash provided by the main components of working capital these increases were offset in part by company contributions to our pension plans and premiums and other fees related to prepayment of debt 

the main components of working capital provided cash of 151 million in 2012 this reflected a decrease in inventories of 441 million partially offset by a 101 million increase in accounts receivable and a 189 million decrease in accounts payable a reduction in the high level of our op—americas olefins inventories that were built at the end of 2011 in preparation for a turnaround scheduled for early july 2012 at our channelview texas facility and the liquidation of refined products and crude oil inventories following the january 2012 shutdown of our berre refinery were the primary contributors to the 441 million decrease in inventories the increase in accounts receivable reflected higher sales volumes at the end of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 while the lower accounts payable at december 31 2012 reflected lower outstanding crude oil invoices compared to december 31 2011 

investing activities —we used cash of 3531 million 1602 million and 1013 million in investing activities in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

in 2014 we invested cash in investmentgrade and other highquality financial instruments that provide flexibility to redeploy funds as needed to meet our cash flow requirements while maximizing yield we invested 3439 million in securities deemed availableforsale and classified as shortterm investments and 425 million in triparty repurchase agreements classified as shortterm loans receivable in 2014 we also received proceeds of 1751 million and 75 million respectively upon the maturity of certain of our availableforsale securities and repurchase agreements see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these investments 

the following table summarizes our capital expenditures plan for 2015 and actual capital expenditures for our continuing operations for the periods from 2012 through 2014 

 

   

capital spending projected for 2015 is expected to increase over 2014 levels the largest increases are projected for our id and refining segments and include turnaround activities and environmentalrelated matters we have also projected modest increases in 2015 capital spending for our op—eai segment this increased level of spending is offset in part by lower projected spending in 2015 for our op—americas segment as compared to 2014 

completion of the ethylene expansion and associated turnaround at our la porte texas facility a debottleneck at our corpus christi texas facility and the installation of new furnaces at our channelview texas facility are reflected in the increase in 2014 capital spending for the op—americas segment relative to 2013 this increase was offset in part by reduced capital spending for our id refining and op—eai segments in 2014 relative to 2013 due primarily to the completion in 2013 of the restart of our methanol plant in channelview texas a major turnaround at our houston texas refinery and a butadiene expansion project in wesseling germany respectively 

the higher levels of capital spending for our id and op—americas segments in 2013 relative to 2012 were primarily related to the methanol plant restart in channelview texas and the ethylene expansion project at our la porte texas facility respectively 

financing activities —financing activities used cash of 5907 million 1589 million and 2145 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

we made payments totaling 5788 million and 1949 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively to acquire a portion of our outstanding ordinary shares we also made dividend payments totaling 1403 million 1127 million and 2415 million to our shareholders in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the dividend payments in 2012 included a special dividend of 275 per share paid on december 11 2012 to shareholders of record on november 19 2012 for additional information related to these share repurchases and dividend payments see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

in october 2014 we entered into a new commercial paper program we received net proceeds of 262 million through the issuance and repurchase of commercial paper instruments under this program during 2014 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and the discussion of liquidity and capital resources below for additional information related to our new commercial paper program 

in february 2014 we issued 1000 million of 4875 notes due 2044 and received net proceeds of 988 million 

in july 2013 we received net proceeds totaling 1468 million from the issuance of 750 million of 4 guaranteed notes due 2023 and 750 million of 525 guaranteed notes due 2043 and paid fees totaling 23 million 

we also received 3000 million of proceeds in 2012 from the issuance of 2000 million of 5 senior notes due 2019 and 1000 million of 575 senior notes due 2024 net proceeds from the notes together with cash on hand were used to finance the repayment in full of the remaining 2676 million of previously outstanding notes and to pay 294 million for associated premiums and fees which are reflected in operating cash flows 

in may 2012 we entered into a fiveyear revolving credit facility and terminated our assetbased credit facility as discussed in “liquidity and capital resources” below we amended and restated this credit facility in june 2014 the revolving credit facility may be used for dollar and euro denominated borrowings and includes a sublimit for up to 700 million of dollar and euro denominated letters of credit the balance of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under the facility may not exceed 2000 million at any given time 

  

in september 2012 we entered into a threeyear 1000 million us accounts receivable securitization facility that permits the sale of certain eligible trade receivables to participating financial institutions the facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to 200 million 

in the aggregate we paid fees related to these 2012 financing activities totaling 53 million 

for additional information related to these financing activities see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources —as of december 31 2014 we had 2624 million unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities classified as shortterm investments for additional information related to our purchases of marketable securities which currently include certificates of deposit commercial paper and bonds see the investing activities section above and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

at december 31 2014 we had 433 million of cash in jurisdictions outside the us principally in the united kingdom approximately 3 of our outstanding cash balance is held in a country that has established government imposed currency restrictions that could impede the ability of our subsidiary to transfer funds to us there are currently no other material or legal or economic restrictions that would impede our transfers of cash 

we also had total unused availability under our credit facilities of 3253 million at december 31 2014 which included the following 

 

  

  

 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our credit facilities 

we also have outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees totaling 688 million at december 31 2014 issued under uncommitted credit facilities 

at december 31 2014 we had total debt including current maturities of 7107 million 

in accordance with our current interest rate risk management strategy and subject to management’s evaluation of market conditions and the availability of favorable interest rates among other factors we may from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements to economically convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to variable rate debt or convert a portion of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 

we entered into us dollar interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of 2000 million during 2014 as part of our current interest rate risk management strategy to achieve a desired proportion of variable 

  

versus fixed rate debt the swaps which have been designated as fair value hedges effectively convert our 2000 million 5 senior notes due 2019 to floating debt based on 3 month usd libor for additional information related to these swaps see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

in october 2014 we entered into a commercial paper program under which we may issue up to 2000 million of privately placed unsecured shortterm promissory notes “commercial paper” this program is backed by our 2000 million senior revolving credit facility proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper may be used for general corporate purposes including dividend payments and share repurchases at december 31 2014 we had 262 million of commercial paper outstanding 

in june 2014 we amended and restated our 2000 million revolving credit facility to among other things reduce undrawn pricing and extend the term of the facility to june 2019 

in february 2014 our direct 100 owned subsidiary lyb international finance bv issued 1000 million of 4875 notes due 2044 at a discounted price of 98831 proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes including repurchases of our ordinary shares interest payments under these notes commenced on september 15 2014 these unsecured notes which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by lyondellbasell industries nv rank equally in right of payment to all of lyb international finance bv’s existing and future unsecured indebtedness and to all of lyondellbasell’s existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness the notes may be redeemed before the date that is six months prior to the scheduled maturity date at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100 of the principal amount of the notes redeemed and the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted at the applicable treasury yield plus 20 basis points on the notes to be redeemed the notes may also be redeemed on or after the date that is six months prior to the final maturity date of the notes at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest 

on july 16 2013 our direct 100 owned subsidiary lyb international finance bv issued 750 million of 4 notes due 2023 and 750 million of 525 notes due 2043 at discounted prices of 98678 and 97004 respectively proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes including repurchases of our ordinary shares interest payments under these notes commenced on january 15 2014 these unsecured notes which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by lyondellbasell industries nv rank equally in right of payment to all of lyb international finance bv’s existing and future unsecured indebtedness and to all of lyondellbasell’s existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness these notes may be redeemed or repaid at any time and from time to time prior to maturity at an amount equal to the greater of 100 of the principal amount of the notes redeemed and repaid and the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the notes to be redeemed exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis at the applicable treasury yield plus 25 basis points in the case of the 4 notes due 2023 and plus 30 basis points in the case of the 525 notes due 2043 

in april 2013 we amended and restated our €450 million european receivables securitization facility to obtain more favorable terms and conditions including reduced pricing and to extend the maturity date of the facility to april 2016 

for additional information related to our credit facilities and notes discussed above see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

during the second quarter of 2014 we concluded our share repurchase program announced in may 2013 under which we could repurchase up to 10 of our shares outstanding we purchased 57584238 shares under this program for approximately 4678 million 

in april 2014 we announced a new share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to 10 of our shares outstanding over the next eighteen months for a total of approximately 53 million shares our share repurchase program does not have a stated dollar amount and purchases may be made through open market 

  

purchases private market transactions or other structured transactions repurchased shares could be retired or used for general corporate purposes including for various employee benefit and compensation plans as of december 31 2014 we have purchased 33 million shares under this program for approximately 3143 million as of february 13 2015 we had approximately 10 million shares remaining under the current authorization the timing and amount of additional shares repurchased will be determined by our management board based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors for additional information related to our share repurchase programs see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

as a result of ceasing operations at our berre refinery in france in january 2012 we expect to make future payments to severed employees and for exit and disposal activities see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this matter 

we may repay or redeem our debt including purchases of our outstanding bonds in the open market using cash on hand cash from operating activities proceeds from the issuance of debt proceeds from asset divestitures or a combination thereof we plan to fund our ongoing working capital capital expenditures debt service and other funding requirements with cash from operations which could be affected by general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory business and other factors many of which are beyond our control cash on hand cash from operating activities proceeds from the issuance of debt or a combination thereof may be used to fund the repurchase of shares under our share repurchase program 

we intend to continue to declare and pay quarterly dividends with the goal of increasing the dividend over time after giving consideration to our cash balances and expected results from operations 

we believe that our cash on hand cash from operating activities and proceeds from our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due 

contractual and other obligations —the following table summarizes as of december 31 2014 our minimum payments for longterm debt including current maturities shortterm debt and contractual and other obligations for the next five years and thereafter 

 

 total debt —our debt includes unsecured senior notes guaranteed notes and various other us and nonus loans see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of covenant requirements under the credit facilities and indentures and additional information regarding our debt facilities 

interest on total debt —our debt and related party debt agreements contain provisions for the payment of monthly quarterly or semiannual interest at a stated rate of interest over the term of the debt 

  

pension and other postretirement benefits —we maintain several defined benefit pension plans as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements many of our us and nonus plans are subject to minimum funding requirements however the amounts of required future contributions for all our plans are not fixed and can vary significantly due to changes in economic assumptions liability experience and investment return on plan assets as a result we have excluded pension and other postretirement benefit obligations from the contractual and other obligations table above our annual contributions may include amounts in excess of minimum required funding levels contributions to our nonus plans in years beyond 2015 are not expected to be materially different than the expected 2015 contributions disclosed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2014 the projected benefit obligation for our pension plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by 953 million subject to future actuarial gains and losses as well as actual asset earnings we together with our consolidated subsidiaries will be required to fund the 953 million with interest in future years we contributed 94 million 172 million and 180 million to our pension plans in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively we provide other postretirement benefits primarily medical benefits to eligible participants as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements we pay other unfunded postretirement benefits as incurred 

advances from customers —we are obligated to deliver products in connection with longterm sales agreements under which advances from customers were received in prior years these advances are treated as deferred revenue and will be amortized to earnings as product is delivered over the remaining terms of the respective contracts which range predominantly from 4 to 8 years the unamortized longterm portion of such advances totaled 69 million as of december 31 2014 

other —other primarily consists of accruals for environmental remediation costs obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and anticipated asset retirement obligations see “critical accounting policies” below for a discussion of obligations for environmental remediation costs 

deferred income taxes —the scheduled settlement of the deferred tax liabilities shown in the table is based on the scheduled reversal of the underlying temporary differences actual cash tax payments will vary depending upon future taxable income see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our deferred tax liabilities 

purchase obligations —we are party to various obligations to purchase products and services principally for raw materials utilities and industrial gases these commitments are designed to assure sources of supply and are not expected to be in excess of normal requirements the commitments are segregated into takeorpay contracts and other contracts under the takeorpay contracts we are obligated to make minimum payments whether or not we take the product or service other contracts include contracts that specify minimum quantities however in the event that we do not take the contractual minimum we are only obligated for any resulting economic loss suffered by the vendor the payments shown for the other contracts assume that minimum quantities are purchased for contracts with variable pricing terms the minimum payments reflect the contract price at december 31 2014 

operating leases —we lease various facilities and equipment under noncancelable lease arrangements for various periods see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for related lease disclosures 

current business outlook 

our raw material and product prices continue to be impacted by the substantial decline in energy prices over the past few months the us ngl advantage enjoyed by our olefins and polymers businesses has been reduced with the decline of global naphtha feedstock prices this reduction has been partially mitigated by lower us natural gas and ngl prices there remains uncertainty about the future path and economic impact of energy prices and the resulting impact on global demand for our products 

  

although margins for our north america olefins and polymers will likely be lower than the 2014 levels due to a reduced ngl advantage and increased supplies associated with easing of industry capacity restrictions we continue to expect margins in 2015 to reflect an ngl advantage we also expect our european olefins margins to decline from high fourth quarter 2014 levels which were primarily related to feedstock price reductions that outpaced those for product prices benefits from significant volumes of advantaged feedstocks and improved product competitiveness with a weaker euro and lower feedstock costs should support eu performance 

our id segment should continue to benefit from extended competitor outages in the po chain and low feedstock costs in 2015 the refining business has experienced a margin reduction as a result of the oil and refined product price declines which is being partly offset by higher volumes of advantaged north american crude oil as pipeline supplies increase 

a continued and sustained decline in crude oil prices and the resulting impact on downstream product prices may result in additional lcm inventory valuation adjustments in all but our technology segment during the first quarter of 2015 

while we believe most of our growth projects that are currently in progress will be advantageous we are reevaluating future capital plans related to our new gulf coast polyethylene facility based on the changes in energy prices and rising construction costs in the gulf coast 

related party transactions 

we have related party transactions with certain of our major shareholders and their affiliates and our joint venture partners we believe that such transactions are effected on terms substantially no more or less favorable than those that would have been agreed upon by unrelated parties on an arm’s length basis see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional related party disclosures 

critical accounting policies 

management applies those accounting policies that it believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the us see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements our more critical accounting policies include those related to the valuation of inventory longlived assets the valuation of goodwill accruals for longterm employee benefit costs such as pension and other postretirement costs and accruals for taxes based on income inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management management periodically updates its estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment 

inventory —we account for our inventory using the lastin firstout “lifo” method of accounting 

the cost of raw materials which represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses and energy costs generally follow price trends for crude oil andor natural gas crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to many factors including changes in economic conditions fluctuation in the prices of crude oil and natural gas from period to period may result in the recognition of charges to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in periods of falling prices and the reversal of those charges in subsequent interim periods as market prices recover accordingly our cost of sales and results of operations may be affected by such fluctuations 

in may 1 2010 upon emergence from bankruptcy we recorded our inventory which is primarily crude oil and correlated products derived therefrom at fair value in accordance with the requirements of freshstart accounting the per barrel benchmark price of wti crude oil at that date was 8615 

during 2014 we recorded lcm inventory valuation adjustments totaling 760 million driven primarily by the decline in the price of crude oil and related declines in the prices of heavy liquids and other correlated 

  

products a 45 million charge was taken in the third quarter of 2014 which marked the beginning of the current downward price trend since the third quarter of 2014 crude oil and other correlated product price indexes have decreased approximately 50 leading to the recognition of an additional 715 million of lcm inventory valuation adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2014 further sustained price declines in our finished goods and raw materials will likely result in future lcm inventory valuation charges during the first quarter of 2015 

longlived assets —with respect to longlived assets which primarily include property plant and equipment and intangible assets key assumptions included estimates of useful lives and the recoverability of carrying values of fixed assets and other intangible assets as well as the existence of any obligations associated with the retirement of fixed assets such estimates could be significantly modified andor the carrying values of the assets could be impaired by such factors as new technological developments new chemical industry entrants with significant raw material or other cost advantages uncertainties associated with the european us and other world economies the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries and uncertainties associated with regulatory governmental actions 

when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we evaluate definite lived intangible assets for impairment longlived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets which for us is generally at the plant group level or at times individual plants in certain circumstances where we have isolated production units with separately identifiable cash flows when it is probable that the undiscounted cash flows of a tangible asset or asset group will not be sufficient to recover the carrying amount the asset is written down to its estimated fair value inprocess research and development projects are impaired when abandoned 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we recognized an impairment charge of 22 million related to damage sustained by our ldpe plant in wesseling germany 

the estimated useful lives of longlived assets range from 3 to 30 years depreciation and amortization of these assets including amortization of capitalized turnaround costs under the straightline method over their estimated useful lives totaled 1019 million in 2014 if the useful lives of assets are found to be shorter than originally estimated depreciation and amortization charges would be accelerated over the revised useful life 

goodwill —goodwill of 566 million at december 31 2014 represents the tax effect of the differences between the tax and book bases of our assets and liabilities resulting from the revaluation of those assets and liabilities to fair value in connection with the company’s emergence from bankruptcy and adoption of freshstart accounting we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill of a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable 

we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors assessed for each of the reporting units include but are not limited to changes in longterm commodity prices discount rates competitive environments planned capacity cost factors such as raw material prices and financial performance of the reporting units if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a twostep quantitative test is required 

we also have the option to proceed directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test under the twostep impairment test the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill for step one of the impairment test the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated using a discounted cashflow model such a model inherently utilizes a significant number of estimates and assumptions including operating margins tax rates discount rates capital expenditures and working capital changes step two of the impairment test would be performed should management conclude that the carrying value of a reporting unit including goodwill is in excess of its fair value in step two of the impairment test the carrying amount of a reporting 

  

unit’s goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of its goodwill valuation experts may be used in such an assessment if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment charge equal to the excess would be recognized 

for 2013 and 2012 management performed qualitative impairment assessments of our reporting units which indicated that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their carrying value accordingly a quantitative twostep goodwill impairment test was not required in 2014 management voluntarily performed a quantitative twostep goodwill impairment test for all reporting units the fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value accordingly no goodwill impairment was recognized in 2014 

longterm employee benefit costs —our costs for longterm employee benefits particularly pension and other postretirement medical and life insurance benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is management’s responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent its best estimates of the future effects of those uncertainties it also is management’s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 

the current benefit service costs as well as the existing liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis the discount rate is a current rate related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled our assumed discount rate is based on yield information for highquality corporate bonds with durations comparable to the expected cash settlement of our obligations for the purpose of measuring the benefit obligations at december 31 2014 we used a weighted average discount rate of 404 for the us plans which reflects the different terms of the related benefit obligations the weighted average discount rate used to measure obligations for nonus plans at december 31 2014 was 284 reflecting market interest rates the discount rates in effect at december 31 2014 will be used to measure net periodic benefit cost during 2015 

the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of other postretirement medical benefits are also measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits as of december 31 2014 the assumed rate of increase for our us plans was 73 decreasing to 45 in 2027 and thereafter a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate assumption would have no significant effect on either the benefit liability or the net periodic cost due to limits on our maximum contribution level under the medical plan 

the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption investment returns that are recognized currently in net income represent the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets applied to a marketrelated value of plan assets which for us is defined as the market value of assets the expected rate of return on plan assets is a longer term rate and is expected to change less frequently than the current assumed discount rate reflecting longterm market expectations rather than current fluctuations in market conditions 

the weighted average expected longterm rate of return on assets in our us plans of 800 is based on the average level of earnings that our independent pension investment advisor had advised could be expected to be earned over time and 412 for our nonus plan assets is based on an expectation and asset allocation that varies by region the asset allocations are summarized in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements the actual returns in 2014 were a gain of 350 for us plan assets and a gain of 2828 for nonus plan assets 

the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets management’s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 

  

net periodic pension cost recognized each year includes the expected asset earnings rather than the actual earnings or loss along with other gains and losses this unrecognized amount to the extent it cumulatively exceeds 10 of the projected benefit obligation for the respective plan is recognized as additional net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service period of the participants in each plan 

the following table reflects the sensitivity of the benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans to changes in the actuarial assumptions 

 

 the sensitivity of our postretirement benefit plans obligations and net periodic benefit costs to changes in actuarial assumptions are reflected in the following table 

 

 additional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

accruals for taxes based on income —the determination of our provision for income taxes and the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities is subject to management’s estimates and judgments due to the complexity of the tax laws and regulations in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of these complex laws and regulations 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 

we recognize future tax benefits to the extent that the realization of these benefits is more likely than not our current provision for income taxes is impacted by the recognition and release of valuation allowances related to net deferred assets in certain nonus jurisdictions further changes to these valuation allowances may impact our future provision for income taxes which will include no tax benefit with respect to losses incurred and no tax expense with respect to income generated in these countries until the respective valuation allowance is eliminated 

we recognize the financial statement benefits with respect to an uncertain income tax position that we have taken or may take on an income tax return when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities for a position that is likely to be sustained the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of lyondellbasell industries nv’s management of commodity price risk foreign currency exposure and interest rate risk through its use of derivative instruments and hedging activities 

commodity price risk 

a substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change accordingly product margins and the level of our profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the business cycle we try to protect against such instability through various business strategies these include provisions in sales contracts allowing us to pass on higher raw material costs through timely price increases formula price contracts to transfer or share commodity price risk and increasing the depth and breadth of our product portfolio 

in addition we selectively use commodity swap and futures contracts with various terms to manage the volatility related to raw materials and product sales such contracts are generally limited to durations of one year or less hedge accounting has not been elected for any of our commodity contracts in any of the periods presented market risks created by these derivative instruments and the marktomarket valuations of open positions are considered by management prior to execution and monitored daily 

the estimated fair value and notional amounts of our open commodity futures contracts are shown in the table below 

 

   

the decreased level in open futures positions in 2014 is related to our strategies to manage the impact of future movements in the price of gasoline distillates and crude oil on our realized product margins 

we use value at risk “var” stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes 

var estimates the maximum potential loss in fair market values given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time using specified confidence levels 

using sensitivity analysis and hypothetical changes in market prices ranging from 12 to 31 which represent a three month volatility range of the underlying products the effect on our pretax income would be less than 1 million the quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account the effects of the underlying operating transactions 

foreign exchange risk 

we manufacture and market our products in a number of countries throughout the world and as a result are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we enter into transactions in currencies other than the applicable functional currency 

a significant portion of our reporting entities use the euro as their functional currency our reporting currency is the us dollar the translation gains or losses that result from the process of translating the euro denominated financial statements to us dollars are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” until such time as those entities may be liquidated or sold changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro can therefore have a significant impact on comprehensive income we generally do not attempt to minimize or mitigate the foreign currency risks resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of nonus operations into our reporting currency 

some of our operations enter into transactions denominated in other than their functional currency this results in exposure to foreign currency risk for financial instruments including but not limited to third party and intercompany receivables and payables and intercompany loans 

we maintain risk management control practices to monitor the foreign currency risk attributable to our intercompany and third party outstanding foreign currency balances these practices involve the centralization of our exposure to underlying currencies that are not subject to central bank andor country specific restrictions by centralizing most of our foreign currency exposure into one subsidiary we are able to take advantage of any natural offsets thereby reducing the overall impact of changes in foreign currency rates on our earnings 

our policy is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies to minimize exchange gains and losses arising from changes in exchange rates to minimize the effects of our net currency exchange exposures we enter into foreign currency spot and forward contracts and in some cases crosscurrency swaps 

we also engage in shortterm foreign exchange swaps in order to roll certain hedge positions and to make funds available for intercompany financing our net position in foreign currencies is monitored daily 

in 2014 we entered into 2000 million noncancellable crosscurrency swaps which we designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges to reduce the variability in the functional currency equivalent cash flows of certain foreign currency denominated intercompany notes for a summary of the estimated fair value and notional amounts for our crosscurrency swaps outstanding at december 31 2014 see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

at december 31 2014 and 2013 a 10 fluctuation compared to the us dollar in the underlying currencies that have no central bank or other currency restrictions would result in an additional impact to earnings of no 

  

more than approximately 2 million a change in the fair value of our crosscurrency swaps resulting from a 10 fluctuation in the euro compared to the us dollar as of december 31 2014 would have no impact to net income 

for 2014 2013 and 2012 other income expense net in the consolidated statements of income reflected a gain of 15 million and losses of 4 million and 21 million respectively in net exchange rate gains and losses for forward contracts including swap transactions that economically hedge recognized monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies no hedge accounting is applied changes in the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are reported in the consolidated statements of income and offset the currency exchange results recognized on the assets and liabilities 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our fixed and variable rate debt fluctuations in interest rates impact the fair value of fixedrate debt as well as pretax earnings stemming from interest expense on variablerate debt 

fixedrate debt —in 2014 we entered into us dollar fixedforfloating interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy to create a balance of fixed and floating rate debt these interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges at december 31 2014 we had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling 2000 million maturing on april 15 2019 

at december 31 2014 after giving consideration to the 2000 million of fixedrate debt that we have effectively converted to floating through these us dollar fixedforfloating interest rate swaps approximately 68 of our debt portfolio on a gross basis incurred interest at a fixedrate and the remaining 32 of the portfolio incurred interest at a variablerate we estimate that a 10 change in market interest rates as of december 31 2014 would change the fair value of our interest rate swaps outstanding and affect our pretax income by approximately 13 million for additional information related to these interest rate swaps see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

variablerate debt —our variable rate debt consists of our 2000 million senior revolving credit facility our 1000 million us receivables securitization facility our €450 million european receivables securitization facility and amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program at december 31 2014 there were no outstanding borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility and us and european receivables facilities we had 262 million of commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2014 we estimate that a 10 change in interest rates will not have a material impact on earnings

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

overview 

lyondellbasell industries nv is a global independent chemical company and was incorporated under dutch law on october 15 2009 unless otherwise indicated the “company” “we” “our” “us” and “lyondellbasell” are used in this report to refer to the businesses of lyondellbasell industries nv and its consolidated subsidiaries we are one of the world’s top five independent chemical companies based on revenues 

we participate globally across the petrochemical value chain and are an industry leader in many of our product lines our chemicals businesses consist primarily of large processing plants that convert large volumes of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon feedstocks into plastic resins and other chemicals our chemical products tend to be basic building blocks for other chemicals and plastics while our plastic products are typically used in large volume applications our customers use our plastics and chemicals to manufacture a wide range of products that people use in their everyday lives including food packaging home furnishings automotive components paints and coatings our refining business consists of our houston refinery which processes crude oil into products such as gasoline diesel and jet fuel 

our financial performance is influenced in general by the supply and demand for the products that we produce the cost and availability of feedstocks global and regional competitor capacity our operational efficiency and our ability to control costs we have a strong operational focus and as a producer of large volume commodities continuously strive to differentiate ourselves through safe reliable and lowcost operations in all our businesses during recent years the cost of natural gasderived raw materials in the us versus the global cost of crude oilderived raw materials has had a significant positive influence on the profitability of our north american operations to a lesser extent our differentiated assets and technology also positively influence our performance as compared to our peers and competitors these include our propylene oxide and polypropylene technologies flexible feedstock olefins plants in the us joint venture olefins and polyolefins plants with access to lowcost feedstock particularly in saudi arabia and our houston refinery which is capable of processing heavy highsulfur crude 

segments 

we manage our operations through five operating segments our reportable segments are 

 

  

  

  

  

 we regularly review our segments and the approach used by management to evaluate performance and resource allocation in 2012 we moved the management responsibility for business decisions relating to oxyfuels 

  

to our id segment because profits generated by oxyfuels are more closely related to sourcing decisions regarding certain coproducts of propylene oxide production which is the core of our id segment all comparable periods presented were revised to reflect this change 

financial information about our business segments and geographical areas can be found in note 22 segment and related information  to the consolidated financial statements information about the locations where we produce our primary products can be found under “description of properties” 

in 2013 2012 and 2011 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues 

olefins and polyolefins segments generally 

we are a leading worldwide producer of olefins including ethylene and propylene we are also a leading producer of polyolefins including polyethylene “pe” and the world’s largest producer of polypropylene “pp” and pp compounds we manage our olefin and polyolefin business in two reportable segments op–americas and op–eai 

olefins —ethylene is the most significant petrochemical in terms of worldwide production volume and is the key building block for pe and a large number of other chemicals plastics and synthetics the production of ethylene results in coproducts such as propylene butadiene and aromatics ethylene and its coproducts are fundamental to many parts of the economy including the production of consumer products packaging housing and automotive components and other durable and nondurable goods 

polyolefins —polyolefins are thermoplastics and comprise approximately twothirds of worldwide thermoplastics demand since their industrial commercialization thermoplastics have been used in wideranging applications and products that improve safety and comfort and enhance the everyday quality of life our products are used in consumer automotive and industrial applications ranging from food and beverage packaging to housewares and construction materials we produce high density polyethylene “hdpe” low density polyethylene “ldpe” and linear low density polyethylene “lldpe” we also produce pp homopolymers pp impact copolymers and pp random copolymers we produce and market several specialty product lines including pp compounds catalloy process resins and polybutene1 “pb1” focusing on unique polyolefins and compounds that offer a wide range of performance characteristics typical properties of such specialty polyolefins and compounds include impactstiffness balance scratch resistance soft touch and heat sealability end uses include automotive and industrial products and materials pp compounds are produced from blends of polyolefins and additives and are sold mainly to the automotive and home appliances industries the catalloy process is proprietary technology that is not licensed to third parties as a result we are the only manufacturer of catalloy process resins which are used primarily in roofing packaging and automotive applications 

sales of pe hdpe ldpe and lldpe collectively accounted for 17 of our total revenues in 2013 and 15 in each of 2012 and 2011 sales of pp including catalloy  accounted for approximately 21 of our total revenues in 2013 and 19 in each of 2012 and 2011 

  

the following table outlines the primary products of our op segments annual processing capacity as of december 31 2013 and the primary uses for those products capacities which are presented in pounds unless otherwise indicated include 100 of the capacity of our joint venture facilities the joint ventures’ proportional share of capacity is shown in the footnotes to the table below 

 

   

   

 

 olefins and polyolefins—americas segment 

overview 

our op—americas segment produces and markets olefins polyolefins aromatics specialty products and ethylene coproducts in addition we produce specialty products including catalloy and plexar resins 

sales  marketing  customers 

our ethylene production is consumed internally as a raw material in the production of polymers and other derivatives with the balance sold to third party customers under multiyear contracts or on a spot basis we have announced ethylene expansion projects for our la porte channelview and corpus christi texas facilities which are projected for completion in 2014 la porte and 2015 channelview and corpus christi in total we expect that these projects will add additional ethylene capacity of approximately 185 billion pounds per year 

we are a net purchaser of propylene a raw material used in the production of po pp and other derivatives our butadiene production is sold to the external market under multiyear contracts all of our production of benzene is used as a raw material in the production of styrene by our id segment and we purchase additional benzene to meet our needs 

in addition to purchases of propylene and benzene at times we purchase ethylene and butadiene for resale when necessary to satisfy customer demand above our own production levels volumes of any of these products purchased for resale can vary significantly from period to period however purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profits 

in the us most of the ethylene and propylene production of our channelview corpus christi and la porte texas facilities is shipped via a pipeline system which has connections to numerous us gulf coast consumers this pipeline system some of which is owned and some of which is leased extends from corpus christi to mont belvieu to port arthur texas as well as into the lake charles louisiana area in addition exchange agreements with other ethylene and coproducts producers allow access to customers who are not directly connected to this pipeline system some ethylene is shipped by rail car from clinton iowa to morris illinois and also to customers a pipeline owned and operated by an unrelated party is used to transport ethylene from morris illinois to tuscola illinois and is used as a raw material in the production of ethanol some propylene is shipped by ocean going vessel butadiene benzene toluene and other products are distributed by pipeline rail car truck barge or ocean going vessel 

our pp and pe production is typically sold through our sales organization to an extensive base of established customers and distributors servicing both the domestic and export markets either under annual contracts or on a spot basis we have regional sales offices in various locations in north america and our polyolefins primarily are transported in north america by railcar or truck export sales are generally to customers in central and south america we also sell pp into our pp compounds business which is managed worldwide by our op–eai segment 

  

joint venture relationships 

we participate in a joint venture arrangement in mexico which provides us with capacity for approximately 640 million pounds of pp production the capacity is based on our percentage ownership of the joint ventures’ total capacity we do not hold a majority interest in or have operational control of this joint venture 

raw materials 

raw material cost is the most significant cost component for the production of ethylene and its coproducts the primary raw materials that can be used are heavy liquids and natural gas liquids “ngls” heavy liquids include crude oilbased naphtha and gas oil as well as domestically sourced condensate a very light crude oil resulting from natural gas production collectively referred to as “heavy liquids” ngls include ethane propane and butane the use of heavy liquid raw materials results in the production of a significant amount of coproducts such as propylene butadiene and benzene as well as gasoline blending components while the use of ngls results in the production of a smaller amount of coproducts 

historically facilities using heavy liquids as feedstock generated higher margins than those using ethane however in recent years ethane has had a significant cost advantage over heavy liquids due to technological advances for extracting shale gas which have led to increased supplies of ngls a plant’s flexibility to consume a wide range of raw materials generally will provide an advantage over plants that are restricted in their processing capabilities we can process significant quantities of either heavy liquids or ngls we estimate that in the us we can process more than 85 ngls changes in the raw material feedstock utilized in the production process will result in variances in production capacities among products we believe our raw material flexibility in the us is a key advantage in our production of ethylene and its coproducts 

in north america we also purchase large amounts of natural gas to be used primarily as an energy source in our business and as the primary feedstock for methanol production by our id segment via marketbased contractual arrangements from numerous suppliers 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to olefins and polyolefins competition is based on price product quality product delivery reliability of supply product performance and customer service industry consolidation in north america has led to fewer although larger competitors profitability is affected not only by supply and demand for olefins and polyolefins but also by raw material costs and price competition among producers which may intensify due to among other things the addition of new capacity in general demand is a function of worldwide economic growth which fluctuates 

we compete in north america with other large marketers and producers including global chemical companies chemical divisions of large oil companies and regional marketers and producers 

based on published data we believe we were as of december 31 2013 

 

  

  

   

olefins and polyolefins–europe asia international segment 

overview 

our op—eai segment produces and markets olefins ethylene and ethylene coproducts and polyolefins we also produce significant quantities of other differentiated products such as catalloy process resins and pb1 our op–eai segment manages our worldwide pp compound business including our facilities in north and south america our worldwide pb1 business and our catalloy process resins produced in europe pp compounds consist of specialty products produced from blends of polyolefins and additives and are sold mainly to the automotive and durable goods industries pb1 a family of butenebased polymers is mainly used in pipe applications and for underfloor heating and thermo sanitary systems 

sales  marketing  customers 

our ethylene production is primarily consumed internally as a raw material in the production of polymers and we purchase additional ethylene to meet our production needs our propylene production is used as a raw material in the production of propylene oxide “po” and pp and we purchase propylene where our internal needs exceed our internal production european ethylene and propylene production is generally fully integrated with our downstream facilities in europe 

we produce and sell butadiene to external customers under multiyear contracts and on a spot basis 

with respect to pp and pe our production is typically sold through our sales organization to an extensive base of established customers under annual contracts or on a spot basis and is also sold through distribution our polyolefins primarily are transported in europe by railcar or truck we believe that over a business cycle average sales prices and profit margins for specialty polymers tend to be higher than average sales prices and profit margins for highervolume commodity polyolefins or polymers 

our regional sales offices are in various locations including the netherlands hong kong china india australia and united arab emirates we also operate through a worldwide network of local sales and representative offices in europe asia and africa our joint ventures typically manage their domestic sales and marketing efforts independently and we typically operate as their agentdistributor for all or a portion of their exports 

joint venture relationships 

we participate in several manufacturing joint ventures in saudi arabia thailand poland australia japan and south korea we do not hold majority interests in any of the joint venture relationships nor do we have operational control these ventures provide us with additional production capacity of approximately 2630 million pounds of pp approximately 810 million pounds of propylene approximately 550 million pounds of ethylene approximately 570 million pounds of hdpe approximately 340 million pounds of ldpe and approximately 160 million pounds of pp compounding these capacities are based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint ventures’ total capacities we realize profits or losses from these ventures as income from equity investments 

we generally license our polyolefin process technologies and supply catalysts to our joint ventures through our technology segment some of our joint ventures source cost advantaged raw materials from their local shareholders 

raw materials 

raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost for the production of ethylene and its coproducts the primary raw materials used in our european olefin facilities are heavy liquids and for our saudi joint venture facilities locally sourced and cost advantaged ngls including ethane propane and butane the 

  

principal raw materials used by our polyolefin and catalloy process resin businesses are propylene and ethylene in europe we have the capacity to produce approximately 50 of the propylene requirements of our european pp business and approximately 90 of the ethylene requirements of our european pe business propylene and ethylene requirements that are not produced internally are generally acquired via spot purchases or pursuant to longterm contracts with thirdparty suppliers 

our pp compounding facilities generally receive their pp and other polymers from one of our wholly owned or joint venture facilities pb1 raw materials are sourced solely from external supply some of our joint ventures receive propylene and ethylene from their local shareholders under longterm contracts 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to olefins and polyolefins competition is based on price product quality product delivery reliability of supply product performance and customer service we compete with regional and multinational chemical companies and divisions of large oil companies the petrochemical market in the eu has been affected by the volatility of naphtha the primary feedstock for olefins in the region as well as fluctuating demand as a result of uncertain economic conditions 

based on published data and including our proportionate share of our joint ventures we believe we were as of december 31 2013 

 

  

  

  

 intermediates and derivatives segment 

overview 

our id segment produces and markets po and its coproducts and derivatives acetyls including methanol ethylene oxide and its derivatives and oxyfuels methyl tertiary butyl ether “mtbe” and ethyl tertiary butyl ether “etbe” po coproducts include styrene monomer “sm” and c4 chemicals tertiary butyl alcohol “tba” most of which is used to make oxyfuels isobutylene and tertiary butyl hydro peroxide “tbhp” po derivatives include propylene glycol “pg” propylene glycol ethers “pge” and butanediol “bdo” we believe that our proprietary po and acetyls production process technologies provide us with a cost advantaged position for these products and their derivatives 

we produce po through two distinct technologies one of which yields tba as the coproduct and the other of which yields sm as the coproduct the two technologies are mutually exclusive meaning that a manufacturing facility must be dedicated either to potba or to posm based on published data regarding mtbe and etbe capacity we believe that we are the largest producer of mtbeetbe worldwide 

  

the following table outlines the primary products annual capacities and primary uses for id’s products capacities which are presented in pounds unless otherwise indicated include 100 of the capacity of joint venture facilities 

 

   

  

  sales  marketing  customers 

we sell our po and its coproducts and derivatives through multiyear sales agreements and spot sales and have a number of multiyear processing or tolling agreements we sell most of our sm production into the north american and european merchant markets and to asian and south american export markets through longterm sales contracts and processing agreements we purchase sm for resale when necessary to satisfy customer demand that exceeds our production levels volumes of sm purchases made for resale can vary significantly from period to period however purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profits po and sm are transported by barge ocean going vessel pipeline railcar and tank truck 

our id segment converts most of its tba which is produced as a coproduct of the po process to isobutylene over half of the isobutylene is reacted with methanol or ethanol to produce mtbe and etbe the remaining isobutylene is sold into the external market as high purity and purity grade isobutylene 

we sell our mtbe and etbe production under market and costbased sales agreements and in the spot market mtbe and etbe are transported by barge ocean going vessel and tank truck substantially all refiners and blenders have discontinued the use of mtbe in the us partly as a result of governmental initiatives to increase use of bioethanol in gasoline and to reduce or effectively ban the use of mtbe however mtbeetbe demand for gasoline blending remains strong within most of the remaining worldwide market accordingly we market mtbe and etbe produced in the us for use outside of the us japan has opted to use etbe as a means of meeting its carbon dioxide reduction commitments under the kyoto protocol and we source a significant portion of japan’s biofuels needs some of our plants have the flexibility to produce either mtbe or etbe to accommodate market needs 

sales of mtbe etbe acetyls po and po coproducts and derivatives are made by our marketing and sales personnel and also through distributors and independent agents in the americas europe the middle east africa and the asia pacific region 

acetyls including acetic acid and vam are consumed internally and sold worldwide under multiyear contracts and on a spot basis acetic acid and vam are shipped by barge ocean going vessel pipeline railcar and tank truck sales are made through a direct sales force agents and distributors our acetyls business uses methanol which we produce internally as a raw material for our production of acetic acid solvents and mtbe and we also sell the methanol under annual contracts and on a spot basis to large us customers in december we restarted our 250 million gallon per year methanol plant in channelview texas in order to take advantage of lowcost natural gas from shale formations the methanol unit had been out of service since 2004 due to the rising cost of natural gas the key feedstock for methanol production methanol is shipped by barge and pipeline 

eo and eg typically are sold under multiyear contracts and on a spot basis with market and costbased pricing glycol ethers are sold primarily into the solvent and distributor markets at market prices the vast 

  

majority of the ethylene derivative products are sold in north america and asia primarily through our sales organizations eo is shipped by railcar and its derivatives are shipped by railcar truck isotank and ocean going vessel 

joint venture relationships 

we have two po joint ventures with bayer corporation we operate four of our us operating units for the us po joint venture bayer’s interest represents ownership of an inkind portion of the po production of 15 billion pounds per year we take inkind the remaining po production and all coproduct sm and tba production we do not share marketing or product sales with bayer under the us po joint venture the parties’ rights in the joint venture are based on off take volumes as opposed to ownership percentages bayer also has the right to 50 of the po and sm production of our european po joint venture our proportional additional production capacity provided through this venture is approximately 340 million pounds of po and approximately 740 million pounds of sm 

we also have joint venture manufacturing relationships in china these ventures provide us with additional production capacity of approximately 115 million pounds of po this capacity is based on our operational share of the joint ventures’ total capacities 

in december 2013 we sold our 40 ownership interest in nihon oxirane company a joint venture in japan that produces po pg and sm for more information see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

raw materials 

the cost of raw materials generally is the largest component of total production cost for po and its coproducts and derivatives the primary raw materials used for the production of po and its coproducts and derivatives are propylene isobutane mixed butane ethylene and benzene the market prices of these raw materials historically have been related to the price of crude oil ngls and natural gas as well as supply and demand for the raw materials 

in the us we obtain a large portion of our propylene benzene and ethylene raw materials needed for the production of po and its coproducts and derivatives from our op–americas segment raw materials for the nonus production of po and its coproducts and derivatives are obtained from our op–eai segment and from third parties we consume a significant portion of our internallyproduced po in the production of po derivatives 

the raw material requirements not sourced internally are purchased at marketbased prices from numerous suppliers in the us and europe with which we have established contractual relationships as well as in the spot market 

we purchase our ethanol requirements for the production of etbe from third parties the methanol for our mtbe production comes from internal production and third parties the primary raw materials required for the production of acetic acid are carbon monoxide and methanol we purchase carbon monoxide pursuant to a longterm contract under which pricing is based primarily on the cost of production all methanol required for acetyls production is internally sourced natural gas is the primary raw material required for the production of methanol 

in addition to ethylene acetic acid is a primary raw material for the production of vam for the production of vam we obtain our entire requirements for acetic acid and ethylene from our internal production historically we have used a large percentage of our acetic acid production to produce vam

with respect to po its coproducts and derivatives competition is based on a variety of factors including product quality and price reliability of supply technical support customer service and potential substitute 

  

materials profitability is affected by the worldwide level of demand along with price competition which may intensify due to among other things new industry capacity po demand growth could be impacted by further development of alternative biobased po derivatives it is not possible to predict accurately the changes in raw material costs market conditions and other factors that will affect industry profitability in the future our major worldwide competitors for sales of po it coproducts and derivatives include other multinational chemical companies as well as some regional marketers and producers 

based on published data regarding po capacity we believe that excluding our partners’ shares of joint venture capacity we are the second largest producer of po worldwide with approximately 13 of the total worldwide capacity for po based on published data regarding mtbe and etbe capacity we believe we are the largest producer of mtbeetbe worldwide with approximately 12 of the total worldwide capacity to produce these combined oxyfuels as of december 31 2013 based on published data regarding sm capacity we believe that we are one of the largest producers of sm worldwide with approximately 5 of the total worldwide capacity for sm as of december 31 2013 we believe that we are the ninth and seventh largest producer of acetic acid and vam respectively each with approximately 3 and 4 of the total worldwide capacity as of december 31 2013 

refining segment 

overview 

our houston refinery which is located on the houston ship channel in houston texas has a heavy highsulfur crude oil processing capacity of approximately 268000 barrels per day on a calendar day basis normal operating basis or approximately 292000 barrels per day on a stream day basis maximum achievable over a 24 hour period the houston refinery has a nelson complexity index of 125 the houston refinery is a full conversion refinery designed to refine heavy highsulfur crude oil this crude oil is more viscous and dense than traditional crude oil and contains higher concentrations of sulfur and heavy metals making it more difficult to refine into gasoline and other highvalue fuel products however this crude oil has historically been less costly to purchase than light lowsulfur crude oil such as brent recently certain crudes such as west texas intermediate wti and west texas sour wts have been priced lower than normal trends due to transportation constraints 

on january 4 2012 we ceased refinery operations at our berre refinery in france the cessation of operations was in accordance with an agreement executed in the fourth quarter of 2011 by certain of our french subsidiaries and union representatives additional information about the cessation of operations can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 3 discontinued operations and related items  to the consolidated financial statements 

the following table outlines the primary products of our refining segment capacity as of december 31 2013 unless otherwise noted and the primary uses for those products 

 

  

   

sales  marketing  customers 

gasoline sales accounted for 9 of our total revenues in 2013 10 in 2012 and 7 in 2011 the houston refinery’s products primarily are sold in bulk to other refiners marketers distributors and wholesalers at marketrelated prices most of the houston refinery’s products are sold under contracts with a term of one year or less or are sold in the spot market the houston refinery’s products generally are transported to customers via pipelines and terminals owned and operated by other parties 

raw materials 

we purchase the crude oil used as a raw material for the houston refinery on the open market on a spot basis and under a number of supply agreements with regional producers generally with terms varying from one to three years 

industry dynamics  competition 

our refining competitors are major integrated oil companies refineries owned or controlled by foreign governments and independent domestic refiners based on published data as of january 2013 there were 143 operable crude oil refineries in the us and total us refinery capacity was approximately 178 million barrels per day during 2013 the houston refinery processed an average of approximately 232000 barrels per day of crude oil representing approximately 13 of all us crude processing capacity 

our refining operations compete for the purchases of crude oil based on price and quality supply disruptions could impact the availability and pricing we compete in gasoline and distillate markets as a bulk supplier of fungible products satisfying industry and government specifications competition is based on price and location 

the markets for fuel products tend to be volatile as well as cyclical as a result of the changing global economy and changing crude oil and refined product prices crude oil prices are impacted by worldwide political events the economics of exploration and production and refined products demand prices and demand for fuel products are influenced by seasonal and shortterm factors such as weather and driving patterns as well as by longer term issues such as the economy energy conservation and alternative fuels industry fuel products supply is dependent on shortterm industry operating capabilities and on longterm refining capacity 

a crack spread is a benchmark indication of refining margins based on the processing of a specific type of crude oil into an assumed selection of refined products the houston refinery generally tracks the maya 211 crack spread which represents the difference between the first month futures price of two barrels of maya crude oil as set by pemex and one barrel each of us gulf coast 87 octane conventional gasoline and us gulf coast ultralowsulfur diesel “ulsd” while these benchmark refining spreads are generally indicative of the level of profitability at the houston refinery and similarly configured refineries there are many other factors specific to each refinery and the industry in general such as the cost of renewable identification numbers rins and the value of byproducts which influence operating results

general 




 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 

  

our business including our results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected by safety or product liability issues 

failure to appropriately manage safety human health product liability and environmental risks associated with our products product life cycles and production processes could adversely impact employees communities stakeholders our reputation and our results of operations public perception of the risks associated with our products and production processes could impact product acceptance and influence the regulatory environment in which we operate while we have procedures and controls to manage safety risks issues could be created by events outside of our control including natural disasters severe weather events and acts of sabotage 

our operations are subject to risks inherent in chemical and refining businesses and we could be subject to liabilities for which we are not fully insured or that are not otherwise mitigated 

we maintain property business interruption product general liability casualty and other types of insurance that we believe are in accordance with customary industry practices however we are not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to our business including losses resulting from natural disasters wars or terrorist acts changes in insurance market conditions have caused and may in the future cause premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies to increase substantially and in some instances for certain insurance to become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured we might not be able to finance the amount of the uninsured liability on terms acceptable to us or at all and might be obligated to divert a significant portion of our cash flow from normal business operations 

further because a part of our business involves licensing polyolefin process technology our licensees are exposed to similar risks involved in the manufacture and marketing of polyolefins hazardous incidents involving our licensees if they do result or are perceived to result from use of our technologies may harm our reputation threaten our relationships with other licensees andor lead to customer attrition and financial losses our policy of covering these risks through contractual limitations of liability and indemnities and through insurance may not always be effective as a result our financial condition and results of operation would be adversely affected and other companies with competing technologies may have the opportunity to secure a competitive advantage 

our ability to source raw materials including crude oil may be adversely affected by political instability civil disturbances or other governmental actions 

we obtain a substantial portion of our principal raw materials from sources in north africa the middle east mexico and south america that may be less politically stable than other areas in which we conduct business such as europe or the us political instability civil disturbances and actions by governments in these areas are likely to substantially increase the price and decrease the supply of raw materials necessary for our operations which will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

recently increased incidents of civil unrest including terrorist attacks and demonstrations which have been marked by violence have occurred in some countries in north africa and the middle east some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest political instability and civil unrest could continue to spread in the region and involve other areas such unrest if it continues to spread or grow in intensity could lead to civil wars regional conflict or regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to countries in which we conduct substantial business such as europe the us or their respective allies 

costs and limitations on supply of raw materials and energy may result in increased operating expenses 

the costs of raw materials and energy represent a substantial portion of our operating expenses energy costs generally follow price trends of crude oil and natural gas these price trends may be highly volatile and cyclical in the past raw material and energy costs have experienced significant fluctuations that adversely 

  

affected our business segments’ results of operations for example we continue to benefit from the favorable ratio of us natural gas prices to crude oil prices however if the price of crude oil decreases relative to us natural gas prices or if the demand for natural gas and ngls increases this may have a negative result on our results of operations additionally the export of ngls from the us greater restrictions on hydraulic fracturing or the lifting by the us government of the ban on us crude oil exports could restrict the availability of our raw materials thereby increasing our costs 

we are not always able to pass raw material and energy cost increases on to our customers when we do have the ability to pass on the cost increases we are not always able to do so quickly enough to avoid adverse impacts on our results of operations 

cost increases for raw materials also may increase working capital needs which could reduce our liquidity and cash flow even if we increase our sales prices to reflect rising raw material and energy costs demand for products may decrease as customers reduce their consumption or use substitute products which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition producers in natural gas costadvantaged regions such as the middle east and north america benefit from the lower prices of natural gas and ngls competition from producers in these regions may cause us to reduce exports from europe and elsewhere any such reductions may increase competition for product sales within europe and other markets which can result in lower margins in those regions additionally there are a limited number of suppliers for some of our raw materials and utilities and in some cases the supplies are specific to the particular geographic region in which a facility is located 

it is also common in the chemical and refining industries for a facility to have a sole dedicated source for its utilities such as steam electricity and gas having a sole or limited number of suppliers may limit our negotiating power particularly in the case of rising raw material costs any new supply agreements we enter into may not have terms as favorable as those contained in our current supply agreements 

additionally there is growing concern over the reliability of water sources including around the texas gulf coast where several of our facilities are located the decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of population growth drought or regulation could negatively impact our operations 

if our raw material or utility supplies were disrupted our businesses may incur increased costs to procure alternative supplies or incur excessive downtime which would have a direct negative impact on plant operations disruptions of supplies may occur as a result of transportation issues including but not limited to as a result of natural disasters and water levels that can affect the ability of vessels barges rails trucks and pipeline traffic these risks are particularly prevalent in the us gulf coast area 

with increased volatility in raw material costs our suppliers could impose more onerous terms on us resulting in shorter payment cycles and increasing our working capital requirements 

economic disruptions and downturns in general and particularly continued economic uncertainty in europe or economic turmoil in emerging markets could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

our results of operations can be materially affected by adverse conditions in the financial markets and depressed economic conditions generally economic downturns in the businesses and geographic areas in which we sell our products substantially reduce demand for our products and result in decreased sales volumes and increased credit risk recessionary environments adversely affect our business because demand for our products is reduced particularly from our customers in industrial markets generally and the automotive and housing industries specifically and may result in higher costs of capital the recent european economic crisis resulted in reduced consumer confidence and spending in many countries in europe particularly southern europe a significant portion of our revenues and earnings are derived from our business in europe including southern europe in addition most of our european transactions and assets including cash reserves and receivables are denominated in euros 

  

europe’s recovery from the economic crisis has been uneven slow and modest if the crisis reemerges or meaningful recovery does not materialize across europe there will likely be a continued negative effect on our european business as well as the businesses of our european customers suppliers and partners in addition if the crisis ultimately led to the breakup of the european economic and monetary union or a significant devaluation of the euro the value of our financial assets that are denominated in euros would be significantly reduced when translated to us dollars for financial reporting purposes we also derive significant revenues from our business in emerging markets particularly the emerging markets in asia and brazil any broadbased downturn in these emerging markets or in a key market such as china could require us to reduce export volumes into these markets and could also require us to divert product sales to less profitable markets any of these conditions could ultimately harm our overall business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

the cyclicality and volatility of the industries in which we participate may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 

our business operations are subject to the cyclical and volatile nature of the supplydemand balance in the chemical and refining industries our future operating results are expected to continue to be affected by this cyclicality and volatility the chemical and refining industries historically have experienced alternating periods of capacity shortages causing prices and profit margins to increase followed by periods of excess capacity resulting in oversupply declining capacity utilization rates and declining prices and profit margins 

in addition to changes in the supply and demand for products changes in energy prices and other worldwide economic conditions can cause volatility these factors result in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over business cycles 

new capacity additions in asia the middle east and north america may lead to periods of oversupply and lower profitability a sizable number of expansions have been announced in north america the timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions are uncertain and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time as a consequence we are unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of future industry cycles or their effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we sell products in highly competitive global markets and face significant price pressures 

we sell our products in highly competitive global markets due to the commodity nature of many of our products competition in these markets is based primarily on price and to a lesser extent on product performance product quality product deliverability reliability of supply and customer service generally we are not able to protect our market position for these products by product differentiation and may not be able to pass on cost increases to our customers 

in addition we face increased competition from companies that may have greater financial resources and different cost structures or strategic goals than us these include large integrated oil companies some of which also have chemical businesses governmentowned businesses and companies that receive subsidies or other government incentives to produce certain products in a specified geographic region increased competition from these companies especially in our olefin and refining businesses could limit our ability to increase product sales prices in response to raw material and other cost increases or could cause us to reduce product sales prices to compete effectively which could reduce our profitability competitors that have greater financial resources than us may be able to invest significant capital into their businesses including expenditures for research and development 

in addition specialty products we produce may become commoditized over time increased competition could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 

  

interruptions of operations at our facilities may result in liabilities or lower operating results 

we own and operate largescale facilities our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our various production facilities and the ability to complete construction and maintenance projects on schedule interruptions at our facilities may materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or our business as a whole during and after the period of such operational difficulties in the past we had to shut down plants on the us gulf coast including the temporary shutdown of our houston refinery as a result of hurricanes striking the texas coast 

in addition because the houston refinery is our only refining operation an outage at the refinery could have a particularly negative impact on our operating results unlike our chemical and polymer production facilities which may have sufficient excess capacity to mitigate the negative impact of lost production at other facilities we do not have the ability to increase refining production elsewhere in the us 

although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions our operations are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and refining and the related storage and transportation of raw materials products and wastes these potential hazards include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or personal injury and loss of life and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities 

increased it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products facilities and services 

increased global information security threats and more sophisticated targeted computer crime pose a risk to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data operations and infrastructure while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive 

  

monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our employees systems networks products facilities and services remain potentially vulnerable to sophisticated espionage or continual cyberassault depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations 

we operate internationally and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations exchange controls political risks and other risks relating to international operations 

we operate internationally and are subject to the risks of doing business on a global level these risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates economic instability and disruptions restrictions on the transfer of funds and the imposition of duties and tariffs additional risks from our multinational business include transportation delays and interruptions war terrorist activities epidemics pandemics political instability import and export controls changes in governmental policies labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments 

we generate revenues from export sales and operations that may be denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency exchange rates between these currencies and functional currencies in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future we also could hedge certain revenues and costs using derivative instruments to minimize the impact of changes in the exchange rates of those currencies compared to the respective functional currencies it is possible that fluctuations in exchange rates will result in reduced operating results additionally we operate with the objective of having our worldwide cash available in the locations where it is needed including the united kingdom for our parent company’s significant cash obligations as a result of dividend and interest payments it is possible that we may not always be able to provide cash to other jurisdictions when needed or that such transfers of cash could be subject to additional taxes including withholding taxes 

our operating results could be negatively affected by the global laws rules and regulations as well as political environments in the jurisdictions in which we operate there could be reduced demand for our products decreases in the prices at which we can sell our products and disruptions of production or other operations additionally there may be substantial capital and other costs to comply with regulations andor increased security costs or insurance premiums any of which could reduce our operating results 

we obtain a substantial portion of our principal raw materials from international sources that are subject to these same risks our compliance with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject could be challenged furthermore these laws may be modified the result of which may be to prevent or limit subsidiaries from transferring cash to us 

furthermore we are subject to certain existing and may be subject to possible future laws that limit or may limit our activities while some of our competitors may not be subject to such laws which may adversely affect our competitiveness 

many of our businesses depend on our intellectual property our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and our inability to do so could reduce our ability to maintain our competitiveness and margins 

we have a significant worldwide patent portfolio of issued and pending patents these patents together with proprietary technical knowhow are significant to our competitive position particularly with regard to propylene oxide performance chemicals petrochemicals and polymers including process technologies such as spheripol  spherizone  hostalen  spherilene  lupotech t and avant catalyst family technology rights we rely on the patent copyright and trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our investment in research 

  

and development manufacturing and marketing however we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without authorization proceedings to protect these rights could be costly and we may not prevail 

the protection afforded by patents varies from country to country and depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage while a presumption of validity exists with respect to patents issued to us our patents may be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable as patents expire the products and processes described and claimed under those patents become generally available for use by competitors 

our continued growth strategy may bring us to regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce in addition patent rights may not prevent our competitors from developing using or selling products that are similar or functionally equivalent to our products moreover our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner which could result in significantly lower revenues reduced profit margins or loss of market share 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary knowhow and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property these confidentiality agreements may be breached may not always be executed may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies may not be available additionally others could obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal or illegal means 

the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes apparatuses technology trade secrets or proprietary knowhow could result in significantly lower revenues reduced profit margins and cash flows andor loss of market share we also may be subject to claims that our technology patents or other intellectual property infringes on a third party’s intellectual property rights unfavorable resolution of these claims could result in restrictions on our ability to deliver the related service or in a settlement that could be material to us 

shared control or lack of control of joint ventures may delay decisions or actions regarding the joint ventures 

a portion of our operations are conducted through joint ventures where control may be exercised by or shared with unaffiliated third parties we cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners including any nonperformance default or bankruptcy of joint venture partners the joint ventures that we do not control may also lack adequate internal controls systems or financial reporting systems to provide adequate and timely information for our reporting purposes 

in the event that any of our joint venture partners do not observe their obligations it is possible that the affected joint venture would not be able to operate in accordance with our business plans as a result we could be required to increase our level of commitment in order to give effect to such plans differences in views among the joint venture participants also may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major matters potentially adversely affecting the business and operations of the joint ventures and in turn our business and operations 

we cannot predict with certainty the extent of future costs under environmental health and safety and other laws and regulations and cannot guarantee they will not be material 

we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture handle or own in addition because our products are components of a variety of 

  

other enduse products we along with other members of the chemical industry are subject to potential claims related to those enduse products any substantial increase in the success of these types of claims could negatively affect our operating results 

we together with the industries in which we operate are subject to extensive national regional state and local environmental laws regulations directives rules and ordinances concerning 

 

  

  

 many of these laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations in addition some of these laws and regulations require us to meet specific financial responsibility requirements any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

although we have compliance programs and other processes intended to ensure compliance with all such regulations we are subject to the risk that our compliance with such regulations could be challenged noncompliance with certain of these regulations could result in the incurrence of additional costs penalties or assessments that could be material 

our industry is subject to extensive government regulation and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures 

compliance with regulatory requirements could result in higher operating costs such as regulatory requirements relating to emissions the security of our facilities and the transportation export or registration of our products we generally expect that regulatory controls worldwide will become increasingly more demanding but cannot accurately predict future developments 

increasingly strict environmental laws and inspection and enforcement policies could affect the handling manufacture use emission or disposal of products other materials or hazardous and nonhazardous waste stricter environmental safety and health laws regulations and enforcement policies could result in increased operating costs or capital expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations additionally we are required to have permits for our businesses and are subject to licensing regulations these permits and licenses are subject to renewal modification and in some circumstances revocation further the permits and licenses are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

we have learned that the european commission has opened an investigation into germany’s renewable energy law as amended in 2012 to examine whether the reduction granted to energyintensive companies on a surcharge for the financing of renewable energy sources in germany is compatible with eu state aid rules if and to the extent that the german government were to attempt to recover the reductions previously granted to our german subsidiaries or otherwise curtail the availability of such reductions in the future the results of our opeai operations would be negatively impacted 

we may incur substantial costs to comply with climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives 

there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas “ghg” reduction these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future laws in this field continue to evolve and while they are likely to be increasingly widespread and stringent at this stage it is not possible to accurately estimate either 

  

a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation within the framework of the eu emissions trading scheme “ets” we were allocated certain allowances of carbon dioxide for the affected plants of our european sites for the period 2008 to 2012 “ets ii period” the ets ii period did not bring additional cost to us as the allowance allocation was sufficient to cover the actual emissions of the affected plants we were able to build an allowance surplus during the ets ii period which has been banked to the scheme for the period 2013 to 2020 “ets iii period” we expect to incur additional costs for the ets iii period despite the allowance surplus accrued over the ets ii period as allowance allocations have been reduced for the ets iii period and more of our plants are affected by the scheme we maintain an active hedging strategy to cover these additional costs we expect to incur additional costs in relation to future carbon or greenhouse gas emission trading schemes 

in the us the environmental protection agency the “epa” has promulgated federal ghg regulations under the clean air act affecting certain sources the epa has issued mandatory ghg reporting requirements requirements to obtain ghg permits for certain industrial plants and proposals for ghg performance standards for some facilities the recent epa action could be a precursor to further federal regulation of carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases and may affect the outcome of other climate change lawsuits pending in us courts in a manner unfavorable to our industry in any event additional regulation may be forthcoming at the us federal or state level with respect to ghg emissions and such regulation could result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances 

compliance with these or other changes in laws regulations and obligations that create a ghg emissions trading scheme or ghg reduction policies generally could significantly increase our costs or reduce demand for products we produce additionally compliance with these regulations may result in increased permitting necessary for the operation of our business or for any of our growth plans difficulties in obtaining such permits could have an adverse effect on our future growth therefore any future potential regulations and legislation could result in increased compliance costs additional operating restrictions or delays in implementing growth projects or other capital investments and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may be required to record material charges against our earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets 

we may be required to reduce production at or idle facilities for extended periods of time or exit certain businesses as a result of the cyclical nature of our industry specifically oversupplies of or lack of demand for particular products or high raw material prices may cause us to reduce production we may choose to reduce production at certain facilities because we have offtake arrangements at other facilities which make any reductions or idling unavailable at those facilities any decision to permanently close facilities or exit a business likely would result in impairment and other charges to earnings 

temporary outages at our facilities can last for several quarters and sometimes longer these outages could cause us to incur significant costs including the expenses of maintaining and restarting these facilities in addition even though we may reduce production at facilities we may be required to continue to purchase or pay for utilities or raw materials under takeorpay supply agreements 

our business is capital intensive and we rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and ongoing capital needs limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results 

we require significant capital to operate our current business and fund our growth strategy moreover interest payments dividends and the expansion of our business or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital we believe that our cash from operations currently will be sufficient to meet these needs however if we need external financing our access to credit markets and pricing of our capital is 

  

dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies and the state of the capital markets generally there can be no assurances that we would be able to incur indebtedness on terms we deem acceptable and it is possible that the cost of any financings could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities which could adversely affect our operating results 

we may use our fiveyear 2 billion revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs to the extent available as of december 31 2013 we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the facility leaving an unused and available credit capacity of 2000 million we may also meet our cash needs by selling receivables under our 1000 million us accounts receivable securitization facility or our €450 million european accounts receivable securitization facility in the event of a default under our credit facility or any of our senior notes we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do any default under any of our credit arrangements could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate 

legislation and regulatory initiatives could lead to a decrease in demand for our products 

new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health safety and the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products initiatives by governments and private interest groups will potentially require increased toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us for example in the united states the national toxicology program “ntp” is a federal interagency program that seeks to identify and select for study chemicals and other substances to evaluate potential human health hazards in the european union the regulation on registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals “reach” is regulation designed to identify the intrinsic properties of chemical substances assess hazards and risks of the substances and identify and implement the risk management measures to protect humans and the environment 

assessments under ntp reach or similar programs or regulations in other jurisdictions may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals we use or produce and may result in additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of those chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the identification and development of talent to succeed senior management 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and we rely heavily on our management team the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations in addition because of the reliance on our management team our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management the retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our strategies 

we may not be able to fully or successfully implement our ongoing plans to improve and globally integrate our business processes and functions 

we continue to seek ways to drive greater productivity flexibility and cost savings in particular we are working towards the improvement and global integration of our business processes and functions as part of these efforts we have been centralizing certain functions implementing new information technology and integrating our existing information technology systems 

  

our ongoing implementation of organizational improvements is made more difficult by our need to coordinate geographically dispersed operations inabilities and delays in implementing improvements can negatively affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings in addition the process of organizational improvements may cause interruptions of or loss of momentum in the activities of our businesses it may also result in the loss of personnel or other labor issues these issues as well as any information technology systems failures also could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 

additionally from time to time certain aspects of our business processes may be outsourced to third parties the processes or the portions thereof that are outsourced generally will tend to be labor intensive transactional activities although we make a diligent effort to ensure that all providers of outsourced services observe proper internal control practices and procedures we cannot assure that failures will not occur the failure of such third parties to provide adequate services could adversely affect our results of operations liquidity or our ability to provide adequate financial and management reporting 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may adversely affect the valuation of pension obligations the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets may result in corresponding increases and decreases in the value of plan assets particularly equity securities or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets any change in key actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate would impact the valuation of pension obligations affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years 

certain of our current pension plans could have projected benefit obligations that exceed the fair value of the plan assets as of december 31 2013 the aggregate deficit was 668 million any declines in the fair values of the pension plans assets could require additional payments by us in order to maintain specified funding levels 

our pension plans are subject to legislative and regulatory requirements of applicable jurisdictions which could include under certain circumstances local governmental authority to terminate the plan 

our operations could be adversely affected by labor relations 

the vast majority of our employees located in europe and south america are represented by labor unions and works councils approximately 850 of our employees located in north america are represented by labor unions 

our operations have been in the past and may be in the future significantly and adversely affected by strikes work stoppages and other labor disputes

environmental 

most of our operations are affected by national state regional and local environmental laws matters pertaining to the environment are discussed in part i item 1a risk factors  part i item 3 legal proceedings  part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation s and notes 2 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

we have made and intend to continue to make the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to environmental health and safety matters we incurred capital expenditures in 2013 for health safety and environmental compliance purposes and improvement programs of 121 million in 2013 and estimate such expenditures to be approximately 215 million in 2014 and 274 million in 2015 

  

while capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance including compliance with potential legislation and potential regulation related to climate change cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe they will have a material effect on our competitive position 

while there can be no assurance that physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future we have reviewed the potential for these risks and have concluded that because of our facility locations and our existing distribution networks we do not believe these risks are material in the near term 

employee relations 

as of december 31 2013 we employed approximately 13300 fulltime and parttime employees around the world of these approximately 5900 were in north america approximately 6300 were in europe and approximately 1100 were in other locations 

as of december 31 2013 approximately 850 of our employees in north america were represented by labor unions the vast majority of our employees in europe and south america are subject to staff council or works council coverage or collective bargaining agreements

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend environmental matters 

from time to time we and our joint ventures receive notices or inquiries from federal state or local governmental entities regarding alleged violations of environmental laws and regulations pertaining to among other things the disposal emission and storage of chemical and petroleum substances including hazardous wastes item 103 of the sec’s regulation sk requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and the proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that we reasonably believe could exceed 100000 the matters below are disclosed solely pursuant to that requirement 

in september 2012 harris county texas filed a lawsuit against our subsidiary equistar chemicals lp in harris county district court in connection with four emissions events between september 2011 and march 2012 at our manufacturing plant in channelview texas the complaint alleges a maximum penalty of 200000 

in september 2013 the louisiana department of environmental quality the “ldeq” issued a compliance order and notice of potential penalty to equistar chemicals lp pertaining to selfreported deviations arising from our polyolefins plant and relating to certain clean air act title v permit conditions limits and other requirements the matter involves deviations reported by us to the ldeq in semiannual reports covering 2007 through june 2011 we reasonably believe that ldeq may assert an administrative penalty demand in this matter in excess of 100000 

in september 2013 epa region v issued a notice and finding of violation alleging violations at our morris illinois facility related to flaring activity specifically the notice generally alleges failures to monitor steam usage and improper flare operations while a penalty demand is expected the notice did not contain any such demand although we reasonably believe that epa region v may assert a penalty demand in excess of 100000 

in september 2013 the epa region vii sent our clinton iowa facility notice that it intended to proceed with the filing of an administrative complaint seeking penalties of approximately 191000 related to alleged violations of the resources conservation and recovery act “rcra” for inadequate secondary containment of hazardous waste container storage areas in january 2014 we entered into a consent agreement and final order pursuant to which we agreed to pay a civil penalty of approximately 27000

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend general 

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes elsewhere in this report when we use the terms “we” “us” “our” or similar words in this discussion unless the context otherwise requires we are referring to lyondellbasell industries nv and its consolidated subsidiaries 

references to industry benchmark prices or costs including the weighted average cost of ethylene production are generally to industry prices and costs from thirdparty consulting data references to industry benchmarks for refining and oxyfuels market margins are to industry prices reported by platts a reporting service of the mcgrawhill companies references to industry benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas are to bloomberg 

overview 

our performance is driven by among other things global economic conditions generally and their impact on demand for our products raw material and energy prices as well as industryspecific issues such as production capacity our businesses are generally subject to the cyclicality and volatility seen in the chemicals and refining industries 

our performance during 2013 highlights the pattern of solid financial results built using our backtobasics strategy supplemented with high return growth projects we continue progress by maintaining our focus on these back to basic principles cost containment and capital discipline our high return growth projects include projects that are focused on capturing additional advantages from us shale gas 

significant items that affected 2013 results include 

 

  

  

  

 other noteworthy items during 2013 include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

results of operations for the periods discussed in these “results of operations” are presented in the table below 

 

 results of operations 

revenues —we had revenues of 44062 million in 2013 45352 million in 2012 and 48183 million in 2011 

2013 versus 2012— revenues decreased 1290 million or 3 in 2013 compared to 2012 lower sales volumes in 2013 contributed 4 to the decrease in revenues over 2012 this decline in sales volumes primarily reflects the negative impact of lower crude processing rates at the houston refinery on refining product volumes which was offset in part by higher olefins sales volumes in our olefins and polyolefins–americas “op–americas” segment the impact of lower sales volumes was slightly mitigated by the effect of favorable exchange rates which increased revenues by 1 in 2013 over 2012 average sales prices were relatively unchanged in 2013 compared to 2012 

2012 versus 2011— lower sales volumes were responsible for a 2 decrease in revenues in 2012 compared to 2011 while lower average product prices contributed 4 to the revenue decrease lower natural gas liquids “ngl” feedstock prices contributed to the lower average sales prices for olefins and polyolefins in the op–americas segment sales volumes in 2012 were lower than in 2011 primarily in european olefins and polyethylene and in refining weak economic conditions in europe turnaround activity at our cracker in wesseling germany and the resale of crude oil in 2011 to take advantage of favorable crude purchases were the main factors in the reduced level of sales volumes in 2012 

cost of sales —cost of sales were 37940 million in 2013 39595 million in 2012 and 42732 million in 2011 

2013 versus 2012— cost of sales declined in 2013 primarily due to a 4 decrease in volumes and a 2 decline in average unit cost of sales which we define as total cost of sales divided by total sales volumes these impacts were partially offset by the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign exchange rates in 2013 relative to 2012 which resulted in a 1 increase in cost of sales these factors combined with the effect of the onetime items specific to 2012 discussed below led to the 1655 million decrease in 2013 cost of sales a shift to cracking more ngls in our op–americas segment increased benefits from lpg cracking and the lower cost 

  

of naphtha in our olefins and polyolefins–eai “op–eai” segment and lower crude oil costs in our refining segment were the most significant contributors to our lower feedstock costs in 2013 these benefits were offset in part by the higher costs of rins and natural gas in our refining segment and the higher costs of propylene benzene and natural gas feedstocks in our intermediates and derivatives “id” segments 

2012 versus 2011— the 3137 million decrease in cost of sales in 2012 compared to 2011 was driven by decreases of 5 in our average unit cost of sales and 2 in volumes the primary factor behind the decrease in our average unit cost of sales was a decline in the cost of feedstocks driven mainly by the lower prices of nglbased raw materials particularly ethane used in north american olefins falling raw material costs including butane methanol and ethanol used in oxyfuels also benefited the average unit costs of sales in the id segment these lower costs were partially offset by slightly higher average naphtha feedstock costs in the op–eai segment and small increases in average crude oil prices in the refining segment 

apart from the factors described above cost of sales in 2012 included benefits totaling 152 million related to insurance proceeds from a 2008 hurricane a recovery related to a former employee who pled guilty to fraud and the reversal of a reserve for an unfavorable monomer contract these 2012 benefits were offset in part by charges totaling 97 million related to reorganization activities in europe facility closure costs in australia and italy and the impairment of a low density polyethylene “ldpe” plant in europe in 2011 cost of sales included 35 million of charges associated with reorganization activities and increased environmental liabilities the impact of these charges was offset by a 34 million insurance recovery related to the fraud matter mentioned above 

operating income —our operating income was 5102 million 4676 million and 4337 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

2013 versus 2012 —the increase in 2013 operating income reflects higher margins offset in part by the decline in volumes and the items specific to 2012 discussed above the lower average cost of feedstocks led to the improvement in margins in 2013 as average sales prices were relatively unchanged compared to 2012 

the higher margins in 2013 were related to olefins and polyethylene in our op–americas and op–eai segments and styrene ethylene oxideethylene glycol “eoeg” and acetyls in our id segment these improvements were partially offset by lower refining margins in our refining segment and lower margins for oxyfuels butanediol “bdo” and solvents in our id segment 

2012 versus 2011— the increase in operating income in 2012 compared to 2011 reflects higher margins offset in part by the decline in volumes margins improved in 2012 as the decrease in average unit cost of sales during 2012 exceeded the decrease in average sales prices during that period relative to 2011 the improvement in margins reflects strong ethylene performance in our op–americas segment and higher oxyfuels margins 

operating results for each of our business segments are reviewed further in the “segment analysis” section below 

interest expense —interest expense was 309 million in 2013 655 million in 2012 and 1044 million in 2011 in 2012 we refinanced most of our longterm debt to lower coupon notes in connection with the refinancing we paid 294 million of premiums and wrote off 18 million of unamortized debt issuance costs the benefit of lower interest expense from the refinancing was partially offset in 2013 by interest on our 4 notes due 2023 and 525 notes due 2043 which were issued in july 2013 in 2012 the benefit of the lower interest expense was offset in part by the premium payments and write off of unamortized debt issuance costs made in connection with the refinancing as well as the 17 million write off of capitalized debt issuance costs in connection with the termination of our us assetbased credit facility in may 2012 

other income expense net —we had other expense net of 14 million in 2013 and other income net of 2 million and 30 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively other expense net in 2013 included a 16 million loss related to the sale of our 40 interest in nihon oxirane company in december 2013 see note 9 to the 

  

consolidated financial statements for additional information on the sale of this investment other income net in 2011 included gains of 41 million related to the sale of excess precious metals 15 million related to the sale of scrap at one of our plants and 15 million related to a settlement associated with the july 2008 crane incident at our houston refinery these gains were partially offset by the negative effect of a 37 million fair value adjustment of the warrants to purchase our shares and 17 million of foreign exchange losses 

income from equity investments —our income from equity investments was 203 million in 2013 143 million in 2012 and 216 million in 2011 

2013 versus 2012— the 60 million increase in income from equity investments in 2013 reflected higher margins and improved operations from our joint ventures in the middle east and asia these benefits were offset in part by a 10 million impairment of our noc asia ltd joint venture for additional information related to this impairment see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements operations improved in 2013 at our al waha joint venture as a result of turnaround activities there in 2012 results for 2012 were also negatively affected by planned maintenance activities at our hmc joint venture and unplanned outages at our al waha joint venture 

2012 versus 2011— the 73 million decrease in 2012 compared to 2011 was due to the lower operating results of our joint ventures in the middle east and asia which were driven by lower average sales prices higher raw material costs and the planned maintenance activities and unplanned outages discussed above 

income taxes —our effective income tax rates of 227 in 2013 317 in 2012 and 300 in 2011 resulted in tax provisions of 1136 million 1327 million and 1059 million respectively 

2013 versus 2012— the 2013 effective income tax rate which was lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35 reflected the release of certain valuation allowances coupled with favorable permanent deductions related to nontaxable income and the us domestic production activity deduction partially offset by the effect of local taxes and foreign exchange gains in 2013 we released valuation allowances primarily associated with tax losses in our french tax group resulting in an overall benefit of 353 million we continue to maintain valuation allowances in various jurisdictions totaling 167 million which could impact our effective tax rate in the future 

2012 versus 2011— the 2012 effective income tax rate which was lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35 reflected the release of certain valuation allowances coupled with favorable permanent deductions related to nontaxable income and the us domestic production activity deduction partially offset by the effect of local taxes the 2011 effective income tax rate which was lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35 reflected favorable permanent deductions related to nontaxable income and the us domestic production activity deduction partially offset by the effect of local taxes 

for further information related to our income taxes see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

loss from discontinued operations net of tax —we had losses from discontinued operations net of tax of 7 million in 2013 24 million in 2012 and 332 million in 2011 

the 308 million improvement in the results of our discontinued operations in 2012 compared to 2011 reflects a benefit from the suspension of operations at the berre refinery in early january 2012 as well as pretax benefits totaling 73 million related to the liquidation of product inventory during 2012 results for 2011 also included charges related to the berre refinery of 130 million and 29 million respectively associated with the estimated cost of the social plan for affected employees and asset impairments 

comprehensive income —we had comprehensive income of 4364 million in 2013 2864 million in 2012 and 1639 million in 2011 the increases in comprehensive income in 2013 and 2012 over the respective prior year periods mainly reflected increases in net income and to a lesser extent foreign currency translation adjustments and actuarial gains and losses related to our defined benefit pension plans and our other postretirement benefit plans 

  

the predominant local currency of our operations outside the united states is the euro which has increased relative to the value of the us dollar during 2013 and 2012 but decreased during 2011 resulting in gains and losses as reflected on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income 

in 2013 411 million of net actuarial gains reflects 254 million of discount rate assumption changes and other immaterial liability experience gains and losses and 157 million resulting from an actual asset return in excess of the expected return in 2012 198 million of actuarial losses primarily reflect 261 million of discount rate assumption changes and other immaterial liability experience gains and losses partially offset by 63 million of gains resulting from an actual asset return in excess of the expected return in 2011 388 million of actuarial losses primarily reflect 247 million due to discount rate assumption changes and other immaterial liability experience gains and losses and 141 million of losses resulting from an actual asset return less than the expected return see “critical accounting policies” below and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the key assumptions included in calculating the discount rate and expected return on plan assets 

segment analysis 

our continuing operations are divided into five reportable segments op–americas op–eai id refining and technology the following tables reflect selected financial information for our reportable segments 

 

 olefins and polyolefins—americas segment 

overview —ethylene produced from ngls in north america has been much lower in cost than that produced from crude oilbased liquids naphtha and other crude oilbased liquids are the predominant feedstocks in the rest of the world margins in our olefins and polyethylene businesses in 2013 2012 and 2011 have benefited from this advantage 

  

stronger segment earnings in 2013 primarily reflect improved olefins and polyethylene results over 2012 olefins results in 2013 benefited from a decrease in our cost to produce ethylene and from higher sales volumes polyethylene results also improved on higher margins while polypropylene results declined on modestly lower margins 

higher operating results for 2012 compared to 2011 were driven by continued strong ethylene performance ethylene margins improved in 2012 despite a decrease in the average price of ethylene as prices for ethane and propane remained advantaged higher sales volumes in 2012 for ethylene reflect stronger domestic demand polypropylene and polyethylene results also contributed to higher segment results on higher margins and moderately higher sales volumes 

ethylene raw materials —benchmark crude oil and natural gas prices generally have been indicators of the level and direction of the movement of raw material and energy costs for ethylene and its coproducts in the op–americas segment ethylene and its coproducts are produced from two major raw material groups 

 

  

 although prices of these raw materials are generally related to crude oil and natural gas prices during specific periods the relationships among these materials and benchmarks may vary significantly in the us we have significant capability to change the mix of raw materials used in the production of ethylene and its coproducts to take advantage of the relative costs of heavy liquids and ngls 

production economics for the industry have favored ngls during 2013 2012 and 2011 as a result we have increased our use of ngls and reduced liquids consumption at our us plants in each year since 2011 during 2013 2012 and 2011 approximately 90 85 and 75 respectively of our us ethylene production was produced from ngls 

the following table shows the average us benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas for the applicable periods as well as benchmark us sales prices for ethylene and propylene which we produce and sell or consume internally the table also shows the discounted us benchmark prices for certain polyethylene and polypropylene products these industry benchmark prices are third party estimates that are indicative of contract sales for some key product grades but do not necessarily describe price trends for our full olefins or polymers product mixes the benchmark weighted average cost of ethylene production which reflects credits for coproduct sales is based on a thirdparty consultant’s estimated ratio of heavy liquid raw materials and ngls used in us ethylene production 

 

   

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the op–americas segment 

 

 revenues —revenues increased by 155 million or 1 in 2013 compared to 2012 and decreased by 1946 million or 13 in 2012 compared to 2011 

2013 versus 2012— in 2013 a 2 increase in revenues attributable to higher olefins sales volumes particularly propylene and butadiene was partly offset by a 1 revenue decrease stemming from lower average sales prices the decrease in 2013 revenues attributable to lower average sales prices primarily reflects lower average sales prices for ethylene and butadiene partly offset by higher average sales prices for polyolefins polyethylene sales prices were higher in 2013 largely reflecting supply constraints due to competitor outages while increases in the cost of propylene feedstock led to higher average sales prices for polypropylene 

2012 versus 2011— in 2012 lower average sales prices across most products were responsible for an 8 decrease in revenue and lower sales volumes were responsible for an additional decrease of 5 average sales prices for ethylene and polyethylene were lower in 2012 mainly reflecting the significantly lower costs of ngl feedstocks lower average sales prices for polypropylene in 2012 reflected lower propylene prices compared to a strong propylene market in 2011 the overall decrease in sales volumes reflects the increased amount of ngls in our olefins feed slate in 2012 as ngls produce significantly less coproducts than liquids feedstock sales volumes of the main products in the segment ethylene polyethylene and polypropylene actually increased in 2012 over 2011 levels the increase in ethylene sales volumes was driven by improved demand and higher spot sales opportunities in 2012 the higher polyethylene sales volumes in 2012 reflect an increase in market share 

cost of sales —cost of sales decreased by 446 million in 2013 compared to 2012 and by 2774 million in 2012 compared to 2011 

2013 versus 2012— the lower cost of sales in 2013 compared to 2012 resulted mainly from a shift in our feedstock slate in 2013 to a higher percentage of lower priced ngl feedstocks in the feed mix this shift in our feedstock slate was largely responsible for a 7 decrease in average unit cost of sales these lower feedstock costs in 2013 were offset in part by the effect of the 2 volume increase mentioned above also cost of sales in 2012 included a 29 million benefit from an insurance settlement related to damages from a hurricane in 2008 

2012 versus 2011— feedstock costs were lower in 2012 compared to 2011 due to the significantly lower prices for ngls particularly ethane and propane and propylene these lower prices resulted in an 17 decline in average unit cost of sales the lower costs described above a 5 decrease in volumes and the 29 million benefit from the insurance settlement discussed above led to the 2774 million decrease in 2012 segment cost of sales 

operating income —operating income increased by 603 million in 2013 compared to 2012 and by 795 million in 2012 compared to 2011 

2013 versus 2012— in 2013 the increase in operating income reflects higher olefins and polyethylene margins and an increase in volumes compared to 2012 the decrease in feedstock costs which more than offset the effect of the lower average sales prices discussed above resulted in the higher margins 

olefins margins benefited from the lower costs of ngl and heavy liquids feedstock which more than offset the impact of lower sales prices this benefit coupled with the higher propylene and butadiene volumes 

  

discussed above led to higher olefins results in 2013 compared to 2012 higher polyethylene margins reflected higher sales prices and to a lesser extent lower feedstock costs although average sales prices were significantly higher for polypropylene in 2013 this benefit was outpaced by the rising cost of its feedstock propylene resulting in modestly lower margins over 2012 in addition operating income in 2012 included the benefit related to the insurance settlement discussed above 

2012 versus 2011— the increase in 2012 operating income primarily reflects higher margins offset in part by the decrease in volumes compared to 2011 the margin improvement in 2012 reflected the benefit of our lower cost of ethylene production in 2012 which surpassed the offsetting impact of lower average sales prices during the period 

although the increase in 2012 operating income was largely attributable to strong ethylene performance better performance in polyethylene and polypropylene yielded higher product margins and sales volumes in 2012 decreases in the prices for ethylene and propylene outpaced declines in average polymer sales prices and led to higher polyethylene and polypropylene margins operating income in 2012 also reflected the benefit related to the hurricane insurance settlement discussed above 

olefins and polyolefins—europe asia and international segment 

overview —although operating results have improved in 2013 compared to 2012 market conditions in europe remain weak operating results in 2013 primarily reflect higher results for european olefins and also reflect improved margins in most businesses relative to 2012 results during 2012 were impacted by a scheduled maintenance turnaround at our wesseling germany plant weak market conditions in 2012 amid economic uncertainty resulted in a decline for european demand for ethylene and polyolefins compared to 2011 the volatility of naphtha feedstock prices throughout 2012 resulted in substantial swings in olefins margins over this period 

operating results in 2012 primarily reflected weak margins and lower sales volumes across most products the decrease in sales volumes reflects weak european demand and the negative impact of reduced production during the last half of 2012 from a turnaround at our wesseling germany cracker the volatility in naphtha feedstock price noted above resulted in compressed olefins cracker margins for most of the year and considerably lower demand reduced butadiene prices and margins relative to 2011 polypropylene and polyethylene results in 2012 reflect lower product margins and polyethylene sales volumes driven by lower demand results for our polypropylene “pp” compounding and polybutene1 businesses were slightly higher in 2012 compared to 2011 

ethylene raw materials —in europe heavy liquids are the primary raw materials for our ethylene production 

  

the following table shows the average western europe benchmark prices for brent crude oil for the applicable periods as well as benchmark western europe prices for ethylene and propylene which we produce and consume internally or purchase from unrelated suppliers and discounted prices for certain polyethylene and polypropylene products these industry benchmark prices are third party estimates that are indicative of contract sales for some key product grades but do not necessarily describe price trends for our full olefins or polymers product mixes 

 

 the following table sets forth selected financial information for the op–eai segment 

 

 revenues —revenues in 2013 increased by 164 million or 1 compared to 2012 and decreased in 2012 by 1070 million or 7 compared to 2011 

2013 versus 2012— in 2013 a 2 increase in revenues driven by the favorable impact of changes in foreign exchange was partially offset by a 1 decrease stemming from lower average sales prices the decrease in average sales prices was largely attributable to lower sales prices for olefins these prices are generally correlated with the cost of naphtha which decreased during 2013 compared to 2012 sales volumes in 2013 decreased less than 1 from 2012 as a small decrease in olefins volumes was substantially offset by a similar increase in polypropylene sales volumes 

2012 versus 2011— lower average sales prices in 2012 contributed 4 to the revenue decrease and lower sales volumes were responsible for the remaining revenue decrease of 3 compared to 2011 the lower average sales prices and sales volumes reflect weak economic conditions in europe in addition polyethylene sales volumes were affected by an explosion in a reactor bay at our ldpe plant in wesseling germany that occurred during the first quarter 2012 

cost of sales— cost of sales decreased by 48 million in 2013 compared to 2012 and by 754 million in 2012 compared to 2011 

2013 versus 2012— cost of sales in 2013 decreased slightly as the combined benefit of the small change in volumes and a 2 decrease in average unit cost of sales was not quite offset by a 2 unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates the decline in the 2013 average unit cost of sales was mainly due to lower naphtha feedstock costs and increased benefits from lpg cracking relative to 2012 in addition to the factors 

  

above cost of sales in 2013 included a 25 million benefit from an insurance settlement related to the damage to our ldpe plant described above cost of sales was also negatively impacted in 2012 by the onetime items mentioned below 

2012 versus 2011— the decline in 2012 cost of sales was mainly due to decreases of 3 in volumes and 2 in average unit cost of sales compared to 2011 decreases in feedstock costs primarily propylene and naphtha were the primary factor in the 2012 decline in unit cost of sales the onetime items discussed below negatively impacted cost of sales in 2012 and 2011 by an equal amount 

in 2012 cost of sales included charges of 35 million for restructuring activities in europe 22 million for closure costs in australia and italy and 22 million for impairment of assets related to the damage of our ldpe plant in wesseling germany described above these charges were partially offset by a 28 million benefit in 2012 related to the reversal of a reserve for an unfavorable monomer contract cost of sales in 2011 also included charges totaling 30 million associated with activities to reorganize certain functional organizations and for increased environmental liabilities at our wesseling germany site 

operating income —operating results increased by 250 million in 2013 compared to 2012 and decreased by 308 million in 2012 compared to 2011 

2013 versus 2012— in 2013 the combined benefit of lower feedstock costs and increased lpg cracking which more than offset the impact of lower average sales prices led to an improvement in margins this improvement in margins the slight decrease in 2013 volumes and the impact of the onetime items in 2013 and 2012 mentioned above resulted in the 250 million increase in 2013 operating income 

the increase in 2013 segment results was driven mainly by higher olefins results the higher olefins results reflect higher margins as lower naphtha feedstock costs and the benefit of processing advantaged feedstock during the summer months more than offset lower average sales prices during the period in addition olefins sales price increases in 2012 lagged steep naphtha feedstock cost increases for several months 

excluding the impact of the onetime items discussed above underlying results for polyolefins reflected higher polyethylene margins and an increase in polypropylene volumes pp compounding margins which reflected higher sales prices coupled with decreases in the costs of its raw materials propylene also improved in 2013 relative to 2012 higher margins due to higher average sale prices contributed to the better polybutene1 results in 2013 compared to 2012 

2012 versus 2011— in 2012 the decrease in average sales prices which was offset in part by the decrease in feedstock costs led to lower margins compared to 2011 these lower margins the impact of lower volumes and 58 million of charges to sga related to the restructuring activities discussed above were largely responsible for the decline in operating income from the level seen in 2011 

excluding the impact of the items occurring in 2012 and 2011 included in the discussion of cost of sales above operating results for 2012 reflect lower cracker and butadiene margins and a 6 decline in olefins production volumes lower butadiene margins were principally the result of lower average sales prices in the second half of 2012 compared to the very strong levels in 2011 as supplies outpaced weaker global demand the turnaround at our wesseling germany cracker and the subsequent delay in the startup of activities during the last half of 2012 contributed to the decline in production volumes 

polyethylene results were lower in 2012 as a result of lower sales volumes and margins margins also declined for polypropylene in europe the lower polyethylene and polypropylene margins reflected decreases in average sales prices that exceeded average decreases in raw material prices the lower polyethylene sales volumes in 2012 reflected lower operating rates which were largely attributable to the wesseling turnaround slightly improved results for our pp compounding and polybutene1 “pb1” businesses reflected margins that were higher in 2012 compared to 2011 sales volumes for pp compounding and pb1 were relatively unchanged over the two periods 

  

intermediates and derivatives segment 

overview —our id operating results for 2013 were lower relative to 2012 mainly due to a decline in oxyfuels results from the exceptionally strong results reported in 2012 additions to bdo industry capacity and raw material increases during 2013 contributed to a decline in our propylene oxide “po” derivative results improved results for styrene acetyls and eoeg in 2013 were driven by higher margins as compared to 2012 results were also negatively impacted during the 2013 period by scheduled maintenance at our facilities in the us and europe 

operating results for 2012 reflected the exceptional performance of our oxyfuels business global gasoline prices and oxygenated blend premiums remained high relative to butane feedstock costs compared to 2011 and our oxyfuels sales volumes increased as we expanded to new regional markets higher margins for tertiary butyl alcohol “tba” and derivatives which reflected higher average sales prices and lower raw material costs also contributed to the higher operating results for the id segment for 2012 these benefits were partially offset by lower results for our po derivatives and lower ethylene glycol margins 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the id segment in addition the table shows mtbe margins in northwest europe “nwe” 

 

 revenues —revenues for 2013 decreased by 186 million or 2 compared to 2012 and increased 158 million or 2 for 2012 compared to 2011 

2013 versus 2012— a 4 decrease in revenues in 2013 stemming from lower sales volumes was offset in part by increases in revenue of 1 due to higher average sales prices and 1 from favorable foreign exchange impacts in 2013 lower sales volumes for po and derivatives and styrene were partially offset by higher oxyfuels and methanol sales volumes compared to 2012 an oversupplied market which more than offset the benefit from nominal demand growth contributed to lower bdo sales volumes in 2013 compared to 2012 turnaround activities in 2013 led to lower styrene volumes during that period improved south american demand resulted in higher oxyfuels sales volumes relative to 2012 the increase in methanol sales volumes was attributable to the restart in december 2013 of our channelview texas methanol plant which had been idled since 2004 

higher average sales prices in 2013 increased revenues by 1 compared to 2012 average sales prices for po increased in 2013 largely due to increases in the price of propylene supply constraints due to industry outages resulted in higher average sales prices for styrene in 2013 compared to 2012 higher demand for methanol due to supply constraints in the middle east and asia coupled with supply constraints for vam in europe led to increases in acetyls sales prices in 2013 over those seen in 2012 these increases were substantially offset by declines in oxyfuels and bdo sales prices oxyfuels sales prices decreased in 2013 reflecting reduced spreads over gasoline relative to a supplyconstrained market in 2012 as well as lower gasoline prices and reduced gasoline spread over butane bdo sales prices also declined due to weak economic conditions and an oversupplied asian market 

2012 versus 2011— the increase in 2012 revenues reflected a 2 increase due to higher sales volumes primarily oxyfuels and acetyls and a decrease of less than 1 from lower average sales prices higher sales 

  

volumes for oxyfuels in 2012 reflected strong market demand and expansion into new geographic markets primarily eastern europe relative to 2011 oxyfuels volumes in 2011 were negatively impacted by turnaround activities in europe increased production from better catalyst yields early in 2012 combined with strong acetyls demand in our european and south american markets contributed to the higher sales volumes for acetyls 

cost of sales —cost of sales decreased by 60 million in 2013 compared to 2012 and by 97 million in 2012 compared to 2011 

2013 versus 2012— cost of sales declined in 2013 relative to 2012 due to the impact of a 4 decrease in volumes discussed above which was partly offset by a 2 increase in average unit cost of sales and a 1 unfavorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on cost of sales higher feedstock costs particularly propylene benzene and natural gas contributed to the increase in the 2013 average unit cost of sales cost of sales in 2012 also included an 18 million benefit related to a hurricane insurance settlement 

2012 versus 2011— the 97 million decrease in segment cost of sales in 2012 reflects a 3 decrease in our average unit cost of sales offset in part by the 2 increase in volumes lower feedstock costs primarily propylene ethylene and butane and to a lesser extent utilities were the primary factors in the decline in unit cost of sales cost of sales was also affected by an 18 million benefit related to an insurance settlement in 2012 

operating income —operating income decreased by 130 million in 2013 compared to 2012 and increased by 274 million in 2012 compared to 2011 

2013 versus 2012— lower margins the decrease in volumes and the absence of the insurance settlement discussed above led to the decline in operating income in 2013 margins were lower in 2013 as the increase in our average unit cost of sales more than offset the increase in average sales prices during the period 

lower results for oxyfuels and po derivatives were offset in part by higher styrene acetyls and eoeg margins oxyfuels results in 2013 reflect lower margins relative to the exceptionally strong margins in 2012 reduced spreads over gasoline relative to a supplyconstrained market in 2012 as well as lower gasoline prices and a reduced gasoline spread over butane contributed to the decrease in oxyfuels margins in 2013 results for po derivatives declined in 2013 primarily due to lower bdo and solvents results an oversupplied asian market which more than offset nominal demand growth resulted in lower sales volumes and weaker margins for bdo in 2013 compared to 2012 

these decreases were partially offset by improved styrene margins due to industry outages which constrained global supply and led to increases in average sales prices in 2013 which outpaced the higher costs of benzene feedstock the improvement in acetyls results reflects the benefit of the restart of our channelview texas methanol plant higher average sales prices and the lower cost of ethylene feedstock the benefits of which were partly offset by higher natural gas costs also contributed to the increase in acetyls results higher margins for eoeg in 2013 reflected a modest increase in average sales prices and lower ethylene feedstock costs 

2012 versus 2011— the decrease in average feedstock costs exceeded the decrease in average sales prices during the period which led to improved product margins in 2012 compared to those seen in 2011 these higher margins coupled with the benefit stemming from higher volumes were the primary drivers leading to the 274 million increase in operating income operating results for 2012 also included the benefit related to the insurance settlement discussed above 

the improvement in oxyfuels margins and volumes were the primary factors for the increase in 2012 operating income the higher oxyfuels margins reflect an increase in the spread between gasoline and raw materials butane methanol and ethanol as well as a higher market blend premium for oxyfuels products over gasoline higher tba and derivatives margins in 2012 which benefited from lower butane feedstock prices due to lower natural gas prices and higher average sales prices also contributed to the increase in operating income 

  

these higher results were offset in part by lower results for po and derivatives and ethylene glycol which saw average sales prices decrease more than the cost of their respective raw materials lower demand for propylene glycol used in deicers due to the unseasonably warm start to winter also contributed to the decrease in 2012 po and derivatives results results for acetyls reflected lower natural gas and ethylene feedstock costs and higher volumes which largely offset lower product sales prices 

refining segment 

overview —the refining segment comprises the operations of our full conversion refinery located on the houston ship channel in houston texas the berre refinery which was previously included in the refining segment through the first quarter of 2012 was classified as discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2012 accordingly results of operations for the berre refinery are not included in the segment discussion 

lower refining margins in 2013 reflect decreases in the average differential between light and heavy crude oils lower byproduct values and higher costs for rins a us government established credit used to show compliance in meeting the environmental protection agency’s renewable fuel standard operating results were unfavorably impacted by lower crude processing rates largely due to turnaround activities 

although the benchmark maya 211 margin increased in 2012 our refinery’s operating results decreased largely as a result of a reduced benefit from favorable crude purchasing opportunities compared to 2011 and lower byproduct spreads for petroleum coke and other natural gasbased products operating results also reflected lower crude processing rates compared to 2011 as a result of planned and unplanned plant outages 

the following table sets forth selected financial information and heavy crude processing rates for the refining segment and the us refining market margins for the applicable periods “lls” is a light crude oil while “maya” is a heavy crude oil 

 

 revenues —revenues decreased by 1593 million or 12 in 2013 compared to 2012 and by 415 million or 3 from 2011 to 2012 

2013 versus 2012— lower sales volumes in 2013 contributed 9 to the revenue decrease over 2012 this decrease in sales volumes corresponds to a 9 decrease in 2013 crude processing rates mainly due to a scheduled turnaround during the first quarter of 2013 and unplanned maintenance during the year in 2013 the increased supply of refined products relative to demand is reflected in a 3 decrease in revenues attributable to lower average refined product sales prices 

2012 versus 2011— lower sales volumes in 2012 were responsible for a revenue decrease of 6 compared to 2011 the lower sales volumes reflected less resale of crude oil versus 2011 in addition crude processing 

  

rates were lower in 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of planned and unplanned outages in 2012 a 3 revenue increase from sales prices in 2012 compared to 2011 was driven by the impact of higher gasoline and distillate prices partly offset by lower values for refinery byproducts 

cost of sales —cost of sales decreased by 1276 million in 2013 compared to 2012 and increased by 40 million in 2012 compared to 2011 

2013 versus 2012— cost of sales in 2013 primarily reflects the 9 decline in volumes discussed above and a 1 decrease in average unit cost of sales relative to 2012 the benefit of lower crude oil feedstock costs in 2013 which was offset in part by 87 million of higher rins costs and increased natural gas costs resulted in the decrease in average unit cost of sales compared to 2012 

additionally cost of sales in 2013 included benefits of 14 million related to recoveries and a settlement associated with a former employee who pled guilty to fraud and 10 million related to the resolution of property tax assessments for the threeyear period beginning 2011 in 2012 cost of sales benefited from 53 million of insurance settlement proceeds associated with a hurricane in 2008 and a recovery of 24 million related to the employee fraud matter discussed above 

2012 versus 2011— in 2012 a 7 increase in our average unit cost of sales relative to 2011 was driven by higher feedstock costs which reflected a reduced benefit from favorable crude purchasing opportunities and higher heavy crude prices relative to 2011 this increase was somewhat offset by the 6 decline in volumes discussed above in 2012 cost of sales also included 77 million of onetime benefits described above while 2011 reflected a 34 million benefit from an insurance recovery related to the fraud mentioned above 

operating income —operating income decreased by 312 million in 2013 compared to 2012 and by 475 million in 2012 compared to 2011 

2013 versus 2012— lower margins the effect of the lower volumes and the specific onetime items impacting each period that are discussed above led to the decrease in 2013 operating income compared to 2012 margins were lower in 2013 as our average unit cost of sales declined less than our average sales prices our refining margins in 2013 which were lower relative to 2012 were impacted by decreases in the average differential between light and heavy crude oils lower byproduct values and higher natural gas and rins costs also negatively impacted our margins in 2013 

crude oil costs at the refinery in 2013 relative to 2012 reflected increased purchases priced in relation to wti and brent crude oils and a lesser amount priced relative to maya which has reduced the comparability of our refined product spreads with the maya benchmark product spread 

2012 versus 2011— the 475 million decrease in 2012 operating income relative to 2011 reflected lower margins the effect of lower volumes and the impact on each period of the specific onetime items discussed above the increase in our average unit cost of sales in 2012 which more than offset the benefit of higher average sales prices resulted in margins that were lower than those seen in 2011 

our refining margins decreased in 2012 despite an increase in the maya 211 benchmark margin our refining margins in 2012 which were lower relative to the maya 211 reflected a reduced benefit from favorable crude purchasing opportunities compared to 2011 and lower byproduct spreads for petroleum coke and other natural gasbased products 

technology segment 

overview —improved operating results in 2013 compared to 2012 reflect higher licensing and services revenues and lower research and development “rd” expenses 

  

restructuring activities in europe in 2012 and 2011 and the impairment of a research and development project in 2011 contributed to the decline in 2012 technology segment results over 2011 underlying operations of the technology segment in 2012 were relatively unchanged from 2011 

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the technology segment 

 

 revenues —revenues increased by 34 million or 7 in 2013 compared to 2012 and decreased by 8 million or 2 in 2012 compared to 2011 

2013 versus 2012— higher licensing and services revenues primarily due to a onetime lumpsum settlement in 2013 associated with a process license agreement entered into in a prior year contributed 7 to the increase in 2013 revenues over 2012 lower catalyst sales volumes decreased revenues by 2 while average catalyst sales prices in 2013 remained relatively unchanged from 2012 favorable foreign exchange rates contributed the remaining 2 increase in 2013 revenues 

2012 versus 2011— the decrease in 2012 revenues reflects lower catalyst sales volumes which were responsible for a revenue decrease of 1 in 2012 compared to 2011 price changes in 2012 accounted for a revenue decrease of 4 compared to 2011 in addition the recognition of higher revenues on process licenses issued in prior years in 2012 resulted in an increase of 3 in revenues compared to 2011 

operating income —operating income increased by 35 million in 2013 compared to 2012 and by 15 million in 2012 compared to 2011 

2013 versus 2012— the improvement in operating income in 2013 reflects higher licensing and services revenues discussed above and lower rd costs compared to 2012 in 2012 segment results included an 18 million charge related to rd restructuring activities in europe 

2012 versus 2011— the underlying operations of the technology segment’s businesses in 2012 were relatively unchanged compared to 2011 lower catalyst results which stemmed from lower margins and sales volumes were substantially offset by higher revenue recognized from process licenses issued in prior years 

apart from the factors discussed above operating results for 2012 included the 18 million charge related to the restructuring activities discussed above in addition charges of 16 million related to restructuring activities and asset retirement obligations associated with a relocated rd facility and 19 million for the impairment of an rd project in europe were included in our 2011 operating results 

financial condition 

operating investing and financing activities of continuing operations which are discussed below are presented in the following table 

 

   

operating activities —cash of 4835 million provided in 2013 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items proceeds received from italian tax authorities for refunds of vat from prior periods distributions from our joint ventures insurance settlements and cash provided by the main components of working capital – accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable these increases were offset in part by company contributions to our pension plans 

the main components of working capital provided cash of 60 million in 2013 this reflects increases of 64 million 151 million and 275 million in accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable respectively the increase in inventory is attributable to a build in our op—americas polyethylene inventory at the end of 2013 in preparation for a turnaround scheduled during the first half of 2014 at our la porte texas facility and an increase in crude oil inventory over 2012 levels these increases were only partially offset by decreases in our id segment inventories the increase in accounts receivable reflects higher 2013 sales volumes compared to the same period in 2012 within the op—americas and id segments a temporary increase in the purchase of intermediate feedstocks due to operating issues at the houston refinery at the end of 2013 and an increase in payment terms for crude oil purchases in our refining segment were the primary drivers for the increase in accounts payable 

cash of 4787 million provided in 2012 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items proceeds received from income tax refunds distributions from our joint ventures insurance settlements and cash provided by the main components of working capital these increases were offset in part by company contributions to our pension plans and premiums and other fees related to prepayment of debt 

the main components of working capital provided cash of 151 million in 2012 this reflects a decrease in inventories of 441 million partially offset by a 101 million increase in accounts receivable and a 189 decrease in accounts payable a reduction in the high level of our op—americas olefins inventories that were built at the end of 2011 in preparation for a turnaround scheduled for early 2012 at our channelview texas facility and the liquidation of refined products and crude oil inventories following the january 2012 shutdown of our berre refinery were the primary contributors to the 441 million decrease in inventories the increase in accounts receivable reflects higher sales volumes at the end of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 while the lower accounts payable balance at december 31 2012 reflects lower outstanding crude oil invoices compared to december 31 2011 

cash of 2860 million provided in 2011 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items and higher distributions from our joint ventures partially offset by an increase in cash used by the main components of working capital and payments totaling 1699 million related to company contributions to our pension plans tax payments premiums and other fees related to prepayments of debt and a litigation settlement 

the main components of working capital used cash of 118 million in 2011 the increase in these working capital components during 2011 reflects increases of 89 million and 732 million in accounts receivable and inventories respectively partially offset by a 703 million increase in accounts payable the increases in both accounts receivable and accounts payable reflect increasing prices over the period the increase in inventories reflects higher prices and increased volumes especially in the op—americas business segment as we built inventory in preparation for a major first quarter 2012 turnaround 

investing activities —cash used in investing activities in 2013 2012 and 2011 primarily reflects capital expenditures of 1561 million 1060 million and 1050 million respectively the increased level of capital spending in 2013 funded turnaround activities at several sites construction of our methanol plant restart at our channelview texas site debottlenecks of certain assets to enhance production railcar purchases and other plant improvement projects in 2011 we purchased a pipeline for 73 million and received proceeds of 71 million from the sale of assets which included 57 million related to the sale of surplus precious metals 

  

the following table summarizes our capital expenditures plan for 2014 and actual capital expenditures for our continuing operations for the periods from 2011 through 2013 

 

 in 2011 our discontinued operations had capital expenditures of 29 million 

capital spending projected for 2014 reflects a small increase over 2013 levels in 2014 capital spending for our op—americas segment is projected to increase relative to 2013 due to the expected completion of an ethylene expansion and associated turnaround at our laporte texas facility a planned debottleneck at our corpus christi texas facility and the installation of new furnaces at our channelview texas facility this increase will be offset in part by reduced capital spending planned for the id and refining segments capital spending planned for the id segment is lower in 2014 due to the completion in 2013 of the restart of our methanol plant in channelview texas 

the higher levels of capital spending for our id and op—americas segments in 2013 relative to 2012 were primarily related to the methanol plant restart in channelview texas and the ethylene expansion project at our laporte texas facility respectively 

financing activities —financing activities used cash of 1589 million during 2013 we made payments totaling 1949 million to repurchase ordinary shares and paid dividends of 1127 million to our shareholders 

in july 2013 we received net proceeds totaling 1468 million from the issuance of 750 million of 4 guaranteed notes due 2023 and 750 million of 525 guaranteed notes due 2043 and paid fees totaling 23 million 

financing activities used cash of 2145 million during 2012 financing activities in 2012 reflect proceeds of 3000 million from the issuance of 2000 million of 5 senior notes due 2019 and 1000 million of 575 senior notes due 2024 net proceeds from the notes together with cash on hand were used to finance the repayment in full of the remaining 2676 million of previously outstanding notes and to pay 294 million for associated premiums and fees which are reflected in operating cash flows 

in may 2012 we entered into a fiveyear revolving credit facility and terminated our assetbased credit facility the revolving credit facility may be used for dollar and euro denominated borrowings and includes a sublimit for up to 700 million of dollar and euro denominated letters of credit the balance of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under the facility may not exceed 2000 million at any given time 

in september 2012 we entered into a threeyear 1000 million us accounts receivable securitization facility that permits the sale of certain eligible trade receivables to participating financial institutions the facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to 200 million 

in the aggregate we paid fees related to these 2012 financing activities totaling 53 million 

  

cash dividends of 2415 million were paid during 2012 which include a special dividend of 275 per share paid on december 11 2012 to shareholders of record on november 19 2012 

financing activities used cash of 4955 million during 2011 in 2011 we redeemed an aggregate of 3050 million of previously existing notes we paid premiums totaling 404 million and bank fees of 7 million in conjunction with these redemptions 

also in 2011 we issued 1000 million of 6 senior notes due 2021 and used the proceeds to pay a portion of a special dividend of 450 per share totaling 2580 million in addition to the special dividend we paid a final 2010 dividend and interim dividends totaling 313 million in june 2011 we paid 15 million of fees related to the amendment of our assetbased credit facility 

for additional information related to these financing activities see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources —as of december 31 2013 we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 4450 million of which 1528 million was held outside the us principally in the united kingdom less than 1 of our outstanding cash balance is held in a country that has established government imposed currency restrictions that could impede the ability of our subsidiary to transfer funds to us there are currently no other legal or economic restrictions that would impede such transfers of cash we also had total unused availability under our credit facilities of 3469 million at december 31 2013 which included the following 

 

  

  

 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our credit facilities 

we also have outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees totaling 424 million at december 31 2013 issued under uncommitted credit facilities 

at december 31 2013 we had total debt including current maturities of 5835 million 

on july 16 2013 our direct 100 owned subsidiary lyb international finance bv issued 750 million of 4 notes due 2023 and 750 million of 525 notes due 2043 at discounted prices of 98678 and 97004 respectively proceeds from these notes are being used for general corporate purposes including repurchases of our ordinary shares interest payments under these notes commenced on january 15 2014 these unsecured notes which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by lyondellbasell industries nv rank equally in right of payment to all of lyb international finance bv’s existing and future unsecured indebtedness and to all of lyondellbasell’s existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness these notes may be redeemed or repaid at any time and from time to time prior to maturity at an amount equal to the greater of 100 of the principal amount of the notes redeemed and repaid and the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the notes to be redeemed exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption 

  

discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis at the applicable treasury yield plus 25 basis points in the case of the 4 notes due 2023 and plus 30 basis points in the case of the 525 notes due 2043 

in may 2013 we amended our 2000 million revolving credit facility to extend its maturity date by one year to may 2018 and in april 2013 we amended and restated our €450 million european receivables securitization facility to obtain more favorable terms and conditions including reduced pricing and to extend the maturity date of the facility to april 2016 

in may 2013 our supervisory board announced a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to 10 of our shares outstanding through may 21 2014 for a total of approximately 576 million shares our share repurchase program does not have a stated dollar amount and purchases may be made through open market purchases private market transactions or other structured transactions repurchased shares may be retired or used for general corporate purposes including various employee benefit and compensation plans as of december 31 2013 we have purchased 27359002 shares under this program for approximately 1949 million as of february 18 2014 we had approximately 267 million shares remaining under the current authorization the timing and amount of additional shares repurchased will continue to be determined by our management board based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors 

as a result of ceasing operations at our berre refinery in france in january 2012 we expect to make future payments to severed employees and for exit and disposal activities see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this matter 

we may repay or redeem our debt including purchases of our outstanding bonds in the open market using cash on hand cash from operating activities or proceeds from asset divestitures we plan to finance our ongoing working capital capital expenditures debt service and other funding requirements with cash from operations we also may depending on market conditions access the debt markets to finance our funding requirements our cash from operations and ability to access debt markets could be affected by general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory business and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

we intend to continue to declare and pay quarterly dividends with the goal of increasing the dividend over time after giving consideration to our cash balances and expected results from operations we believe that our cash on hand cash from operating activities and proceeds from our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due 

contractual and other obligations —the following table summarizes as of december 31 2013 our minimum payments for longterm debt including current maturities shortterm debt and contractual and other obligations for the next five years and thereafter 

 

   

total debt —total debt includes our 5 senior notes due 2019 our 6 senior notes due 2021 our 4 guaranteed notes due 2023 our 575 senior notes due 2024 our 81 guaranteed notes due 2027 our 525 guaranteed notes due 2043 and various other us and nonus loans see note 12 for a discussion of covenant requirements under the credit facilities and indentures and additional information regarding our debt facilities 

interest on total debt —our debt and related party debt agreements contain provisions for the payment of monthly quarterly or semiannual interest at a stated rate of interest over the term of the debt 

pension and other postretirement benefits —we maintain several defined benefit pension plans as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements many of our us and nonus plans are subject to minimum funding requirements however the amounts of required future contributions for all our plans are not fixed and can vary significantly due to changes in economic assumptions liability experience and investment return on plan assets as a result we have excluded pension and other postretirement benefit obligations from the contractual and other obligations table above our annual contributions may include amounts in excess of minimum required funding levels contributions to our nonus plans in years beyond 2014 are not expected to be materially different than the expected 2014 contributions disclosed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2013 the projected benefit obligation for our pension plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by 668 million subject to future actuarial gains and losses as well as actual asset earnings we together with our consolidated subsidiaries will be required to fund the 668 million with interest in future years we contributed 172 million 180 million and 526 million to our pension plans in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively we provide other postretirement benefits primarily medical benefits to eligible participants as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements we pay other unfunded postretirement benefits as incurred 

advances from customers —we are obligated to deliver products in connection with longterm sales agreements under which advances from customers were received in prior years these advances are treated as deferred revenue and will be amortized to earnings as product is delivered over the remaining terms of the respective contracts which primarily range from 4 to 8 years the unamortized longterm portion of such advances totaled 76 million as of december 31 2013 

other —other primarily consists of accruals for environmental remediation costs obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and anticipated asset retirement obligations see “critical accounting policies” below for a discussion of obligations for environmental remediation costs 

deferred income taxes —the scheduled settlement of the deferred tax liabilities shown in the table is based on the scheduled reversal of the underlying temporary differences actual cash tax payments will vary depending upon future taxable income 

purchase obligations —we are party to various obligations to purchase products and services principally for raw materials utilities and industrial gases these commitments are designed to assure sources of supply and are not expected to be in excess of normal requirements the commitments are segregated into takeorpay contracts and other contracts under the takeorpay contracts we are obligated to make minimum payments whether or not we take the product or service other contracts include contracts that specify minimum quantities however in the event that we do not take the contractual minimum we are only obligated for any resulting economic loss suffered by the vendor the payments shown for the other contracts assume that minimum quantities are purchased for contracts with variable pricing terms the minimum payments reflect the contract price at december 31 2013 

operating leases —we lease various facilities and equipment under noncancelable lease arrangements for various periods see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for related lease disclosures 

  

current business outlook 

we believe the fundamentals underlying our businesses remain the same the us natural gas liquids advantage continues to evolve in a very positive way and we are executing our growth projects to take advantage of these market opportunities we believe olefins in north america will continue to benefit from strong margins derived from costadvantaged ngls weatherrelated increases in natural gas and ngl prices are being seen in the first quarter of 2014 which we believe are temporary we will commence an olefins turnaround at our laporte texas facility late in the first quarter which will extend into the second quarter we expect european olefin and polyolefin demand to improve in the first quarter 2014 from the seasonallylow levels seen in the fourth quarter of 2013 

our id segment continues to realize solid steady performance and will additionally benefit from the start up of our methanol plant in channelview texas the global refining market has been volatile but improving of late we expect our refining position to strengthen in 2014 as north american crude production grows and the delivery infrastructure expands 

related party transactions 

we have related party transactions with certain of our major shareholders and their affiliates and our joint venture partners we believe that such transactions are effected on terms substantially no more or less favorable than those that would have been agreed upon by unrelated parties on an arm’s length basis see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional related party disclosures 

critical accounting policies 

management applies those accounting policies that it believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the us see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements our more critical accounting policies include those related to the valuation of inventory longlived assets the valuation of goodwill accruals for longterm employee benefit costs such as pension and other postretirement costs and accruals for taxes based on income inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management management periodically updates its estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment 

inventory —we account for our inventory using the lastin firstout “lifo” method of accounting 

the cost of raw materials which represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses and energy costs generally follow price trends for crude oil andor natural gas crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to many factors including changes in economic conditions fluctuation in the prices of crude oil and natural gas from period to period may result in the recognition of charges to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in periods of falling prices and the reversal of those charges in subsequent interim periods as market prices recover accordingly our cost of sales and results of operations may be affected by such fluctuations 

a 71 million charge to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market at june 30 2012 was reversed in the third quarter of 2012 reflecting the recovery of market price as of september 30 2012 no lower of cost or market charges were required in 2011 

longlived assets —with respect to longlived assets which primarily include property plant and equipment and intangible assets key assumptions included estimates of useful lives and the recoverability of carrying values of fixed assets and other intangible assets as well as the existence of any obligations associated with the retirement of fixed assets such estimates could be significantly modified andor the carrying values of the assets could be impaired by such factors as new technological developments new chemical industry entrants with significant raw material or other cost advantages uncertainties associated with the european us and other world economies the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries and uncertainties associated with regulatory governmental actions 

  

when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we evaluate definite lived intangible assets for impairment longlived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets which for us is generally at the plant group level or at times individual plants in certain circumstances where we have isolated production units with separately identifiable cash flows when it is probable that the undiscounted cash flows of a tangible asset or asset group will not be sufficient to recover the carrying amount the asset is written down to its estimated fair value inprocess research and development projects are impaired when abandoned 

during the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 we recognized impairments of 22 million and 19 million respectively related to damage sustained by our ldpe plant in wesseling germany and an abandoned inprocess research and development project 

the estimated useful lives of longlived assets range from 3 to 30 years depreciation and amortization of these assets including amortization of capitalized turnaround costs under the straightline method over their estimated useful lives totaled 1021 million in 2013 if the useful lives of assets are found to be shorter than originally estimated depreciation and amortization charges would be accelerated over the revised useful life 

goodwill —goodwill of 605 million at december 31 2013 represents the tax effect of the differences between the tax and book bases of the our assets and liabilities resulting from the revaluation of those assets and liabilities to fair value in connection with the company’s emergence from bankruptcy and adoption of freshstart accounting we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill of a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable 

we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors assessed for each of the reporting units include but are not limited to changes in longterm commodity prices discount rates competitive environments planned capacity cost factors such as raw material prices and financial performance of the reporting units if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a twostep quantitative test is required 

for 2013 2012 and 2011 our qualitative assessment indicated that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their carrying value accordingly a quantitative twostep goodwill impairment test was not required 

longterm employee benefit costs —our costs for longterm employee benefits particularly pension and other postretirement medical and life insurance benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is management’s responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent its best estimates of the future effects of those uncertainties it also is management’s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 

the current benefit service costs as well as the existing liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis the discount rate is a current rate related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled our assumed discount rate is based on yield information for highquality corporate bonds with durations comparable to the expected cash settlement of our obligations for the purpose of measuring the benefit obligations at december 31 2013 we used a weighted average discount rate of 473 for the us plans which reflects the different terms of the related benefit obligations the weighted average discount rate used to measure obligations for nonus plans at december 31 2013 was 378 reflecting market interest rates the discount rates in effect at december 31 2013 will be used to measure net periodic benefit cost during 2014 

  

the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of other postretirement medical benefits are also measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits as of december 31 2013 the assumed rate of increase for our us plans was 76 decreasing to 45 in 2027 and thereafter a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate assumption would have no significant effect on either the benefit liability or the net periodic cost due to limits on our maximum contribution level under the medical plan 

the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption investment returns that are recognized currently in net income represent the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets applied to a marketrelated value of plan assets which for us is defined as the market value of assets the expected rate of return on plan assets is a longer term rate and is expected to change less frequently than the current assumed discount rate reflecting longterm market expectations rather than current fluctuations in market conditions 

the weighted average expected longterm rate of return on assets in our us plans of 800 is based on the average level of earnings that our independent pension investment advisor had advised could be expected to be earned over time and 373 for our nonus plan assets is based on an expectation and asset allocation that varies by region the asset allocations are summarized in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements the actual returns in 2013 were a gain of 1645 for us plan assets and a gain of 139 for non us plan assets 

the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets management’s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 

net periodic pension cost recognized each year includes the expected asset earnings rather than the actual earnings or loss along with other gains and losses this unrecognized amount to the extent it cumulatively exceeds 10 of the projected benefit obligation for the respective plan is recognized as additional net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service period of the participants in each plan 

the following table reflects the sensitivity of the benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans to changes in the actuarial assumptions 

 

 the sensitivity of our postretirement benefit plans obligations and net periodic benefit costs to changes in actuarial assumptions are reflected in the following table 

   

additional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

accruals for taxes based on income —the determination of our provision for income taxes and the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities is subject to management’s estimates and judgments due to the complexity of the tax laws and regulations in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of these complex laws and regulations 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 

we recognize future tax benefits to the extent that the realization of these benefits is more likely than not our current provision for income taxes is impacted by the recognition and release of valuation allowances related to net deferred assets in certain nonus jurisdictions further changes to these valuation allowances may impact our future provision for income taxes which will include no tax benefit with respect to losses incurred and no tax expense with respect to income generated in these countries until the respective valuation allowance is eliminated 

we recognize the financial statement benefits with respect to an uncertain income tax position that we have taken or may take on an income tax return when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities for a position that is likely to be sustained the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of lyondellbasell industries nv’s management of commodity price risk foreign currency exposure and interest rate risk through its use of derivative instruments and hedging activities 

commodity price risk 

a substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change accordingly product margins and the level of our profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the business cycle we try to protect against such instability through various business strategies these include provisions in sales contracts allowing us to pass on higher raw material costs through timely price increases formula price contracts to transfer or share commodity price risk and increasing the depth and breadth of our product portfolio 

in addition we selectively use commodity swap option and futures contracts with various terms to manage the volatility related to purchases of natural gas and raw materials as well as product sales such contracts are generally limited to durations of one year or less hedge accounting has not been elected for any of our commodity contracts in any of the periods presented market risks created by these derivative instruments and the marktomarket valuations of open positions are monitored by management 

  

the estimated fair value and notional amounts of our open commodity futures contracts are shown in the table below 

 

 the increased level in open futures positions in 2013 is related to our strategies to manage the impact of future movements in the price of gasoline and crude oil on our product margins and the price differential between varying grades of crude oil 

we use value at risk “var” stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes 

var estimates the maximum potential loss in fair market values given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time using specified confidence levels 

using sensitivity analysis and hypothetical changes in market prices ranging from 6 to 14 which represents a three month volatility range of the underlying products the effect on our pretax income would be 9 million the quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account the effects of the underlying operating transactions 

foreign exchange risk 

we manufacture and market our products in a number of countries throughout the world and as a result are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we enter into transactions in currencies other than the applicable functional currency 

a significant portion of our reporting entities use the euro as their functional currency our reporting currency is the us dollar the translation gains or losses that result from the process of translating the euro 

  

denominated financial statements to us dollars are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” until such time as those entities may be liquidated or sold changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro can therefore have a significant impact on comprehensive income we generally do not attempt to minimize or mitigate the foreign currency risks resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of nonus operations into our reporting currency 

some of our operations enter into transactions denominated in other than their functional currency this results in exposure to foreign currency risk for financial instruments including but not limited to third party and intercompany receivables and payables and intercompany loans 

we maintain risk management control practices to monitor the foreign currency risk attributable to our intercompany and third party outstanding foreign currency balances these practices involve the centralization of our exposure to underlying currencies that are not subject to central bank andor country specific restrictions by centralizing most of our foreign currency exposure into one subsidiary we are able to take advantage of any natural offsets thereby reducing the overall impact of changes in foreign currency rates on our earnings 

our policy is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies to minimize exchange gains and losses arising from changes in exchange rates to minimize the effects of our net currency exchange exposures we enter into foreign currency spot and forward contracts our net position in foreign currencies is monitored daily 

at december 31 2013 and 2012 a 10 fluctuation compared to the us dollar in the underlying currencies that have no central bank or other currency restrictions would result in an additional impact to earnings of no more than approximately 2 million and 3 million respectively 

we also engage in shortterm foreign exchange swaps in order to roll certain hedge positions and to make funds available for intercompany financing 

for 2013 2012 and 2011 other income expense net in the consolidated statements of income reflected losses of 4 million 21 million and 17 million respectively in net exchange rate gains and losses for forward contracts including swap transactions that economically hedge recognized monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies no hedge accounting is applied changes in the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are reported in the consolidated statements of income and offset the currency exchange results recognized on the assets and liabilities 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to variable rate debt our variable rate debt consists of our 2000 million senior revolving credit facility our 1000 million us receivables securitization facility and our €450 million european receivables securitization facility at december 31 2013 there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

overview 

lyondellbasell industries nv is a global independent chemical company and was incorporated under dutch law on october 15 2009 unless otherwise indicated the “company” “we” “our” “us” and “lyondellbasell” are used in this report to refer to the businesses of lyondellbasell industries nv and its consolidated subsidiaries we believe we are one of the world’s top five independent chemical companies based on revenues we participate globally across the petrochemical value chain and are an industry leader in many of our product lines our chemicals businesses consist primarily of large processing plants that convert large volumes of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon feedstock into plastic resins and other chemicals our chemical products tend to be basic building blocks for other chemicals and plastics while our plastic products are typically used in large volume applications our customers use our plastics and chemicals to manufacture a wide range of products that people use in their everyday lives including food packaging home furnishings automotive components paints and coatings our refining business consists of our houston refinery which processes crude oil into fuels such as gasoline diesel and jet fuel 

our financial performance is influenced in general by the supply and demand for the products that we produce the cost and availability of feedstocks global and regional competitor capacity our operational efficiency and our ability to control costs as a producer of large volume commodities we have a strong operational focus and continuously strive to differentiate ourselves through safe reliable and lowcost operations in all our businesses during recent years the cost of natural gasderived raw materials in the us versus the global cost of crude oilderived raw materials has had a significant influence on the profitability of our north american operations to a lesser extent our differentiated assets and technology also influence our performance as compared to our peers and competitors these include our propylene oxide and polypropylene technologies flexible feedstock olefins plants in the us joint venture olefins and polyolefins plants with access to lowcost feedstock particularly in saudi arabia and our houston refinery which is capable of processing heavy highsulfur crude 

segments 

we operate in five business segments our reportable segments are 

 

  

  

  

  

 the marketing of our oxyfuels products previously was aligned with the sale of our products from our refining business particularly our berre refinery we moved the management responsibility for business decisions relating to oxyfuels to our id business with the closure of the berre refinery because profits generated by oxyfuels products are related to sourcing decisions regarding certain coproducts of propylene oxide production accordingly results for our oxyfuels business which were previously included in our refining segment results have been reflected in our id segment since the second quarter of 2012 all comparable periods presented have been revised to reflect this change 

  

financial information about our business segments and geographical areas can be found in note 22 segment and related information  to the consolidated financial statements information about the locations where we produce our primary products can be found under “description of properties” 

industry dynamics  competition 

we predominantly compete in regional markets impacted by global pricing mechanisms success in these markets is determined by competitive pricing low cost production product quality reliability of product delivery and supply volumes and customer service profitability is affected by regional raw material costs and price competition among producers historically the chemical and refining industries have operated in competitive environments and those environments are expected to continue 

in addition to other chemical and refining companies we compete with the chemical and refining divisions of major national and international oil companies both in the united states and abroad 

our products and raw materials are transported by barge ocean going vessel pipeline rail car bulk truck and tank truck 

in 2012 2011 and 2010 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues 

olefins and polyolefins segments generally 

we are a leading worldwide producer of olefins including ethylene and propylene we are also a leading producer of polyolefins including polyethylene “pe” and the world’s largest producer of polypropylene “pp” and pp compounds we manage our olefin and polyolefin business in two reportable segments op—americas and op—eai 

olefins –ethylene is the most significant petrochemical in terms of worldwide production volume and is the key building block for pe and a large number of other chemicals plastics and synthetics the production of ethylene results in coproducts such as propylene butadiene and aromatics ethylene and its coproducts are fundamental to many parts of the economy including the production of consumer products packaging housing and automotive components and other durable and nondurable goods 

polyolefins –polyolefins are thermoplastics and comprise approximately twothirds of worldwide thermoplastics demand since their industrial commercialization thermoplastics have been used in wideranging applications and products that improve safety and comfort and enhance the everyday quality of life our products are used in consumer automotive and industrial applications ranging from food and beverage packaging to housewares and construction materials we produce high density polyethylene “hdpe” low density polyethylene “ldpe” and linear low density polyethylene “lldpe” we produce homopolymer impact copolymer random copolymer and metallocene pp 

we produce and market several specialty product lines including pp compounds catalloy process resins and polybutene1 “pb1” focusing on unique polyolefins and compounds that offer a wide range of performance characteristics typical properties of such specialty polyolefins and compounds include impactstiffness balance scratch resistance soft touch and heat sealability end uses include automotive and industrial products and materials pp compounds are produced from blends of polyolefins and additives and are sold mainly to the automotive and home appliances industries we are the only manufacturer of catalloy process resins which are our proprietary products and are used primarily in roofing packaging and automotive applications 

sales of pe hdpe ldpe and lldpe collectively accounted for 15 of our total revenues in 2012 and 2011 and 16 in 2010 sales of pp including catalloy  accounted for approximately 19 of our total revenues in 2012 and 2011 and 18 in 2010 

  

the following table outlines the primary products of our op segments annual processing capacity as of december 31 2012 and the primary uses for those products capacities which are presented in pounds unless otherwise indicated include 100 of the capacity of our joint venture facilities the joint ventures’ proportional share of capacity is shown in the footnotes to the table below 

 

   

  

 olefins and polyolefins—americas segment 

overview 

our op—americas segment produces and markets olefins polyolefins aromatics specialty products and ethylene coproducts based on published data we are the largest producer of light olefins ethylene and propylene and pp and the third largest producer of pe in north america in addition we produce specialty products including catalloy and plexar resins 

sales  marketing  customers 

our ethylene production is consumed internally as a raw material in the production of polymers and other derivatives with the balance sold to third party customers we are a net purchaser of propylene a raw material 

  

used in the production of po pp and other derivatives our butadiene production is sold to the external market under multiyear contracts all of our internal production of benzene is used as a raw material in the production of styrene by our id segment and we purchase additional benzene to meet our needs 

in addition to purchases of propylene and benzene at times we purchase ethylene and butadiene for resale when necessary to satisfy customer demand above our own production levels volumes of any of these products purchased for resale can vary significantly from period to period however purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profits 

our pp and pe production is typically sold to an extensive base of established customers servicing both the domestic and export markets either under annual contracts or on a spot basis export sales are generally to customers in central and south america we also sell pp into our pp compounds business which is managed worldwide by our op—eai segment 

joint venture relationships 

we participate in a joint venture arrangement in mexico which provides us with capacity for 643 million pounds of pp production the capacity is based on our percentage ownership of the joint ventures’ total capacity we do not hold a majority interest in or have operational control of this joint venture 

raw materials 

raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost for the production of ethylene and its coproducts the primary raw materials used are heavy liquids and domestically sourced and currently cost advantaged natural gas liquids “ngls” mainly from regional producers via a mix of contractual and spot arrangements heavy liquids include crude oilbased naphtha and gas oil as well as condensate a very light crude oil resulting from natural gas production collectively referred to as “heavy liquids” ngls include ethane propane and butane the use of heavy liquid raw materials results in the production of a significant amount of coproducts such as propylene butadiene and benzene as well as gasoline blending components while the use of ngls results in the production of a smaller amount of coproducts 

historically facilities using heavy liquids as feedstock have generated higher margins than those using ethane however in recent years ethane has had a cost advantage over heavy liquids due to the recent technological advances for extracting shale gas a plant’s flexibility to consume a wide range of raw materials generally will provide an advantage over plants that are restricted in their processing capabilities we can process significant quantities of either heavy liquids or ngls we estimate that in the us we can process up to 85 ngls changes in the raw material feedstock utilized in the production process will result in variances in production capacities among products we believe our raw material flexibility in the us is a key advantage in our production of ethylene and its coproducts over time 

in north america we also purchase large amounts of natural gas to be used primarily as an energy source in our business via marketbased contractual arrangements from numerous suppliers

 olefins and polyolefins—europe asia international segment 

overview 

our op—eai segment produces and markets olefins ethylene and ethylene coproducts and polyolefins based on published data we are the largest producer of pp in europe and the largest worldwide producer of pp compounds we also produce significant quantities of other differentiated products such as catalloy process resins and pb1 our op—eai segment manages our worldwide pp compound business including our facilities in north and south america our worldwide pb1 business and our catalloy process resins produced in europe 

pp compounds consist of specialty products produced from blends of polyolefins and additives and are sold mainly to the automotive and durable goods industries the catalloy process is proprietary technology that is not licensed to third parties and as a result we are the only manufacturer of catalloy process resins we believe that we are the largest worldwide producer of pb1 a family of butenebased polymers a majority of the current pb1 we produce is used in pipe applications and for underfloor heating and thermo sanitary systems 

sales  marketing  customers 

our ethylene production is generally consumed internally as a raw material in the production of polymers our propylene production is used as a raw material in the production of po and pp and we purchase propylene as our internal needs exceed our internal production european ethylene and propylene production is generally fully integrated with our downstream facilities in europe 

we produce and sell butadiene to external customers under multiyear contracts and on a spot basis 

with respect to pp and pe our production is typically sold to an extensive base of established customers under annual contracts or on a spot basis we believe that over a business cycle average sales prices and profit margins for specialty polymers tend to be higher than average sales prices and profit margins for highervolume commodity polyolefins or polymers 

our regional sales offices are in various locations including the netherlands hong kong china india and united arab emirates we also operate through a worldwide network of local sales and representative offices in europe asia and africa our joint ventures typically manage their domestic sales and marketing efforts independently and we typically operate as their agentdistributor for all or a portion of their exports 

joint venture relationships 

we participate in several manufacturing joint ventures in saudi arabia thailand poland australia japan and south korea we do not hold majority interests in any of the joint venture relationships nor do we have operational control these ventures provide us with additional production capacity of 2630 million pounds of pp 810 million pounds of propylene 550 million pounds of ethylene 570 million pounds of hdpe 340 million pounds of ldpe and 160 million pounds of pp compounding these capacities are based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint ventures’ total capacities 

we generally license our polyolefin process technologies and supply catalysts to our joint ventures through our technology segment some of our joint ventures source cost advantaged raw materials from their local shareholders 

  

raw materials 

raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost for the production of ethylene and its coproducts the primary raw materials used in our european olefin facilities are heavy liquids and for our saudi joint venture facilities locally sourced and cost advantaged ngls including ethane propane and butane the principal raw materials used by our polyolefin and catalloy process resin businesses are propylene and ethylene in europe we have the capacity to produce approximately 50 of the propylene requirements of our european pp business and approximately 90 of the ethylene requirements of our european pe business propylene and ethylene requirements that are not produced internally generally are acquired via spot purchases or pursuant to longterm contracts with thirdparty suppliers 

our pp compounding facilities generally receive their pp and other polymers from one of our wholly owned or joint venture facilities pb1 raw materials are sourced solely from external supply some of our joint ventures receive propylene and ethylene from their local shareholders under longterm contracts

 intermediates and derivatives segment 

overview 

our id segment produces and markets po and its coproducts and derivatives acetyls ethylene oxide and its derivatives and oxyfuels methyl tertiary butyl ether “mtbe” and ethyl tertiary butyl ether “etbe” po coproducts include styrene monomer “sm” and c4 chemicals tertiary butyl alcohol “tba” most of which is used to make oxyfuels isobutylene and tertiary butyl hydro peroxide “tbhp” po derivatives include propylene glycol “pg” propylene glycol ethers “pge” and butanediol “bdo” we believe that our proprietary po and acetyls production process technologies provide us with a cost advantaged position for these products and their derivatives 

we produce po through two distinct technologies based on indirect oxidation processes one of which yields tba as the coproduct and the other of which yields sm as the coproduct the two technologies are mutually exclusive meaning that a manufacturing facility must be dedicated either to potba or to posm we believe that we are the largest producer of mtbeetbe worldwide 

  

capacities which are presented in pounds unless otherwise indicated include 100 of the capacity of joint venture facilities 

 

   

  

 sales  marketing  customers 

we produce and deliver our po and its coproducts and derivatives through sales agreements processing agreements and spot sales as well as product exchanges we have a number of multiyear processing or tolling and sales agreements we sell most of our sm production into the north american and european merchant markets and to asian and south american export markets through longterm sales contracts and processing agreements we purchase sm for resale when necessary to satisfy customer demand that exceeds our production levels volumes of sm purchases made for resale can vary significantly from period to period however purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profits 

our id segment converts most of its tba which is produced as a coproduct of the po process to isobutylene over half of the isobutylene is reacted with methanol or ethanol to produce mtbe and etbe the remaining isobutylene is sold into the external market as high purity and purity grade isobutylene 

we sell our mtbe and etbe production under marketbased sales agreements and in the spot market substantially all refiners and blenders have discontinued the use of mtbe in the us partly as a result of governmental initiatives to increase use of bioethanol in gasoline and to reduce or effectively ban the use of mtbe however mtbeetbe demand for gasoline blending remains strong within most of the remaining worldwide market accordingly we market mtbe and etbe produced in the us for use outside of the us japan has opted to use etbe as a means of meeting its carbon dioxide reduction commitments under the kyoto protocol and we source a significant portion of japan’s biofuels needs some of our plants have the flexibility to produce either mtbe or etbe to accommodate market needs 

sales of mtbe etbe acetyls po and po coproducts and derivatives are made by our marketing and sales personnel and also through distributors and independent agents in the americas europe the middle east africa and the asia pacific region 

acetyls including acetic acid and vam are consumed internally and sold worldwide under multiyear contracts and on a spot basis our acetyls business uses methanol which we produce internally as a raw material for the production of acetic acid and also sells the methanol under annual contracts and on a spot basis to large us customers 

eo and eg typically are sold under multiyear contracts and on a spot basis with marketbased pricing glycol ethers are sold primarily into the solvent and distributor markets at market prices the vast majority of the ethylene derivative products are sold in north america and asia primarily through our sales organizations 

  

joint venture relationships 

our us po joint venture in which bayer corporation has an interest operates four of our us operating units bayer’s interest represents ownership of an inkind portion of the po production of 15 billion pounds per year we take inkind the remaining po production and all coproduct sm and tba production we do not share marketing or product sales with bayer under the us po joint venture the parties’ rights in the joint venture are based on off take volumes as opposed to ownership percentages bayer also has the right to 50 of the po and sm production of our european po joint venture our proportional additional production capacity provided through this venture is 345 million pounds of po and 740 million pounds of sm 

we also have joint venture manufacturing relationships in japan and china these ventures provide us with additional production capacity of 314 million pounds of po 680 million pounds of sm and 88 million pounds of pg these capacities are based on our ownership percentage of the joint ventures’ total capacities 

raw materials 

the primary raw materials used for the production of po and its coproducts and derivatives are propylene isobutane mixed butane ethylene and benzene the market prices of these raw materials historically have been related to the price of crude oil ngls and natural gas as well as supply and demand for the raw materials 

in the us we obtain a large portion of our propylene benzene and ethylene raw materials needed for the production of po and its coproducts and derivatives internally from our op–americas segment raw materials for the nonus production of po and its coproducts and derivatives are obtained internally and also from third parties we consume a significant portion of our internallyproduced po in the production of po derivatives 

the cost of raw materials generally is the largest component of total production cost for po and its coproducts and derivatives the raw material requirements for these businesses are purchased at marketbased prices from numerous suppliers in the us and europe with which we have established contractual relationships as well as in the spot market 

we purchase our ethanol requirements for the production of etbe from third parties the methanol for our mtbe production comes from internal production and third parties the primary raw materials required for the production of acetic acid are carbon monoxide and methanol we purchase carbon monoxide pursuant to a longterm contract under which pricing is based primarily on the cost of production all methanol required for acetyls production is internally sourced natural gas is the primary raw material required for the production of methanol 

in addition to ethylene acetic acid is a primary raw material for the production of vam for the production of vam we obtain our entire requirements for acetic acid and ethylene from our internal production historically we have used a large percentage of our acetic acid production to produce vam 

industry dynamics  competition 

based on published data regarding po capacity we believe that excluding our partners’ shares of joint venture capacity we are the second largest producer of po worldwide with approximately 13 of the total worldwide capacity for po based on published data regarding sm capacity we believe that we are one of the largest producers of sm worldwide with approximately 5 of the total worldwide capacity for sm as of december 31 2012 we believe that we are the ninth and eighth largest producer of acetic acid and vam respectively each with approximately 3 and 4 of the total worldwide capacity as of december 31 2012 

  

refining 

overview 

our houston refinery which is located on the houston ship channel in houston texas has a heavy highsulfur crude oil processing capacity of approximately 268000 barrels per day on a calendar day basis normal operating basis or approximately 292000 barrels per day on a stream day basis maximum achievable over a 24 hour period the houston refinery has a nelson complexity index of 125 the houston refinery is a full conversion refinery designed to refine heavy highsulfur crude oil this crude oil is more viscous and dense than traditional crude oil and contains higher concentrations of sulfur and heavy metals making it more difficult to refine into gasoline and other highvalue fuel products however this crude oil has historically been less costly to purchase than light lowsulfur crude oil such as brent recently certain crudes such as west texas intermediate wti and west texas sour wts have been priced lower than normal trends due to transportation constraints 

on january 4 2012 we ceased refinery operations at our berre refinery in france the cessation of operations was in accordance with an agreement executed in the fourth quarter of 2011 by certain of our french subsidiaries and union representatives additional information about the cessation of operations can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

the following table outlines the primary products of our refining segment capacity as of december 31 2012 unless otherwise noted and the primary uses for those products 

 

 sales  marketing  customers 

gasoline sales accounted for 10 of our total revenues in 2012 7 in 2011 and 9 in 2010 the houston refinery’s products primarily are sold in bulk to other refiners marketers distributors and wholesalers at marketrelated prices most of the houston refinery’s products are sold under contracts with a term of one year or less or are sold in the spot market the houston refinery’s products generally are transported to customers via pipelines and terminals owned and operated by other parties 

raw materials 

we purchase the crude oil used as a raw material for the houston refinery on the open market on a spot basis and under a number of supply agreements with regional producers 

industry dynamics  competition 

based on published data as of january 2012 there were 144 operable crude oil refineries in the us and total us refinery capacity was approximately 173 million barrels per day during 2012 the houston refinery processed an average of approximately 255000 barrels per day of crude oil representing approximately 15 of all us crude processing capacity 

  

a crack spread is a benchmark indication of refining margins based on the processing of a specific type of crude oil into an assumed selection of refined products the houston refinery generally tracks the maya 211 crack spread which represents the difference between the first month futures price of two barrels of maya crude oil as set by pemex and one barrel each of us gulf coast 87 octane conventional gasoline and us gulf coast no 2 heating oil highsulfur diesel while these benchmark refining spreads are generally indicative of the level of profitability at the houston refinery and the refining industry generally there are many other factors specific to each refinery that influence operating results 

technology segment

general 




 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 

our business including our results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected by process safety or product liability issues 

failure to appropriately manage safety human health product liability and environmental risks associated with our products product life cycles and production processes could adversely impact employees communities stakeholders our reputation and our results of operations public perception of the risks associated with our products and production processes could impact product acceptance and influence the regulatory environment in which we operate while we have procedures and controls to manage process safety risks issues could be created by events outside of our control including natural disasters severe weather events and acts of sabotage 

  

our operations are subject to risks inherent in chemical and refining businesses and we could be subject to liabilities for which we are not fully insured or that are not otherwise mitigated 

we maintain property business interruption product general liability casualty and other types of insurance including pollution and legal liability that we believe are in accordance with customary industry practices however we are not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to our business including losses resulting from natural disasters wars or terrorist acts changes in insurance market conditions have caused and may in the future cause premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies to increase substantially and in some instances for certain insurance to become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured we might not be able to finance the amount of the uninsured liability on terms acceptable to us or at all and might be obligated to divert a significant portion of our cash flow from normal business operations 

further because a part of our business involves licensing polyolefin process technology our licensees are exposed to similar risks involved in the manufacture and marketing of polyolefins hazardous incidents involving our licensees if they do result or are perceived to result from use of our technologies may harm our reputation threaten our relationships with other licensees andor lead to customer attrition and financial losses our policy of covering these risks through contractual limitations of liability and indemnities and through insurance may not always be effective as a result our financial condition and results of operation would be adversely affected and other companies with competing technologies may have the opportunity to secure a competitive advantage 

our ability to source raw materials including crude oil may be adversely affected by political instability civil disturbances or other governmental actions 

we obtain a substantial portion of our principal raw materials from sources in north africa the middle east and south america that may be less politically stable than other areas in which we conduct business such as europe or the us political instability civil disturbances and actions by governments in these areas are likely to substantially increase the price and decrease the supply of raw materials necessary for our operations which will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

recently increased incidents of civil unrest including terrorist attacks and demonstrations which have been marked by violence have occurred in some countries in north africa and the middle east some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest political instability and civil unrest could continue to spread in the region and involve other areas such unrest if it continues to spread or grow in intensity could lead to civil wars regional conflict or regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to countries in which we conduct substantial business such as europe the us or their respective allies 

costs and limitations on supply of raw materials and energy may result in increased operating expenses 

the costs of raw materials and energy represent a substantial portion of our operating expenses energy costs generally follow price trends of crude oil and natural gas these price trends may be highly volatile and cyclical in the past raw material and energy costs have experienced significant fluctuations that adversely affected our business segments’ results of operations for example we continue to benefit from the favorable ratio of us natural gas prices to crude oil prices however if the price of crude oil decreases relative to us natural gas prices or if the demand for natural gas and ngls increases this may have a negative result on our results of operations additionally the export of ngls from the us and or greater restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could restrict the availability of our raw materials thereby increasing our costs 

we are not always able to pass raw material and energy cost increases on to our customers when we do have the ability to pass on the cost increases we are not always able to do so quickly enough to avoid adverse impacts on our results of operations 

  

cost increases for raw materials also may increase working capital needs which could reduce our liquidity and cash flow even if we increase our sales prices to reflect rising raw material and energy costs demand for products may decrease as customers reduce their consumption or use substitute products which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition producers in natural gas costadvantaged regions such as the middle east and north america benefit from the lower prices of natural gas and ngls competition from producers in these regions may cause us to reduce exports from europe and elsewhere any such reductions may increase competition for product sales within europe and other markets which can result in lower margins in those regions additionally there are a limited number of suppliers for some of our raw materials and utilities and in some cases the supplies are specific to the particular geographic region in which a facility is located 

it is also common in the chemical and refining industries for a facility to have a sole dedicated source for its utilities such as steam electricity and gas having a sole or limited number of suppliers may limit our negotiating power particularly in the case of rising raw material costs any new supply agreements we enter into may not have terms as favorable as those contained in our current supply agreements 

additionally there is growing concern over the reliability of water sources including around the texas gulf coast where several of our facilities are located the decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of population growth drought or regulation could negatively impact our operations 

if our raw material or utility supplies were disrupted our businesses may incur increased costs to procure alternative supplies or incur excessive downtime which would have a direct negative impact on plant operations disruptions of supplies may occur as a result of transportation issues including but not limited to as a result of natural disasters and water levels that can affect the ability of vessels barges rails trucks and pipeline traffic these risks are particularly prevalent in the us gulf coast area 

with increased volatility in raw material costs our suppliers could impose more onerous terms on us resulting in shorter payment cycles and increasing our working capital requirements 

the economic crisis in europe could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

the recent european economic crisis resulted in reduced consumer confidence and spending in many countries in europe particularly southern europe a significant portion of our revenues and earnings are derived from our business in europe including southern europe in addition most of our european transactions and assets including cash reserves and receivables are denominated in euros 

if the european economic crisis continues or further deteriorates there will likely be a continued negative effect on our european business as well as the businesses of our european customers suppliers and partners in addition if the crisis ultimately leads to the breakup of the european economic and monetary union or a significant devaluation of the euro the value of our financial assets that are denominated in euros would be significantly reduced when translated to us dollars for financial reporting purposes any of these conditions could ultimately harm our overall business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

economic downturns and disruptions in financial markets can adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our results of operations can be materially affected by adverse conditions in the financial markets and depressed economic conditions generally economic downturns in the businesses and geographic areas in which we sell our products substantially reduce demand for our products and result in decreased sales volumes recessionary environments adversely affect our business because demand for our products is reduced particularly from our customers in industrial markets generally and the automotive and housing industries specifically 

  

the cyclicality and volatility of the industries in which we participate may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 

our business operations are subject to the cyclical and volatile nature of the supplydemand balance in the chemical and refining industries our future operating results are expected to continue to be affected by this cyclicality and volatility the chemical and refining industries historically have experienced alternating periods of capacity shortages causing prices and profit margins to increase followed by periods of excess capacity resulting in oversupply declining capacity utilization rates and declining prices and profit margins 

in addition to changes in the supply and demand for products changes in energy prices and other worldwide economic conditions can cause volatility these factors result in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over business cycles 

in addition new capacity additions in asia the middle east and north america may lead to periods of oversupply and lower profitability a sizable number of expansions have recently been announced in north america the timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions are uncertain and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time as a consequence we are unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of future industry cycles or their effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we can give no assurances as to any predictions we may make with respect to the timing extent or duration of future industry cycles 

we sell products in highly competitive global markets and face significant price pressures 

we sell our products in highly competitive global markets due to the commodity nature of many of our products competition in these markets is based primarily on price and to a lesser extent on product performance product quality product deliverability reliability of supply and customer service generally we are not able to protect our market position for these products by product differentiation and may not be able to pass on cost increases to our customers 

in addition we face increased competition from companies that may have greater financial resources and different cost structures or strategic goals than us these include large integrated oil companies some of which also have chemical businesses governmentowned businesses and companies that receive subsidies or other government incentives to produce certain products in a specified geographic region increased competition from these companies especially in our olefin and refining businesses could limit our ability to increase product sales prices in response to raw material and other cost increases or could cause us to reduce product sales prices to compete effectively which could reduce our profitability competitors that have greater financial resources than us may be able to invest significant capital into their businesses including expenditures for research and development 

in addition specialty products we produce may become commoditized over time increased competition could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 

interruptions of operations at our facilities may result in liabilities or lower operating results 

we own and operate largescale facilities our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our various production facilities and the ability to complete construction and maintenance projects on schedule interruptions at our facilities may materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or our business as a whole during and after the period of such operational difficulties in the past we had to shut down plants on the us gulf coast including the temporary shutdown of our houston refinery as a result of hurricanes striking the texas coast 

  

in addition because the houston refinery is our only refining operation an outage at the refinery could have a particularly negative impact on our operating results unlike our chemical and polymer production facilities which may have sufficient excess capacity to mitigate the negative impact of lost production at other facilities we do not have the ability to increase refining production elsewhere in the us 

although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions our operations are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and refining and the related storage and transportation of raw materials products and wastes these potential hazards include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities 

increased it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products facilities and services 

increased global information security threats and more sophisticated targeted computer crime pose a risk to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data operations and infrastructure while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our employees systems networks products facilities and services remain potentially vulnerable to sophisticated espionage or continual cyberassault depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations 

we operate internationally and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations exchange controls political risks and other risks relating to international operations 

we operate internationally and are subject to the risks of doing business on a global level these risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates economic instability and disruptions restrictions on the transfer of funds and the imposition of duties and tariffs additional risks from our multinational business include 

  

transportation delays and interruptions war terrorist activities epidemics pandemics political instability import and export controls changes in governmental policies labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments 

we generate revenues from export sales and operations that may be denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency exchange rates between these currencies and functional currencies in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future we also could hedge certain revenues and costs using derivative instruments to minimize the impact of changes in the exchange rates of those currencies compared to the respective functional currencies it is possible that fluctuations in exchange rates will result in reduced operating results additionally we operate with the objective of having our worldwide cash available in the locations where it is needed including the netherlands for our parent company’s significant cash obligations as a result of dividend and interest payments it is possible that we may not always be able to provide cash to other jurisdictions when needed or that such transfers of cash could be subject to additional taxes including withholding taxes this particularly is true of transfers of cash outside of the united states where we currently have significant cash flows from operations 

our operating results could be negatively affected by the global laws rules and regulations as well as political environments in the jurisdictions in which we operate there could be reduced demand for our products decreases in the prices at which we can sell our products and disruptions of production or other operations additionally there may be substantial capital and other costs to comply with regulations andor increased security costs or insurance premiums any of which could reduce our operating results 

we obtain a substantial portion of our principal raw materials from international sources that are subject to these same risks our compliance with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject could be challenged furthermore these laws may be modified the result of which may be to prevent or limit subsidiaries from transferring cash to us 

furthermore we are subject to certain existing and may be subject to possible future laws that limit or may limit our activities while some of our competitors may not be subject to such laws which may adversely affect our competitiveness 

many of our businesses depend on our intellectual property our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and our inability to do so could reduce our ability to maintain our competitiveness and margins 

we have a significant worldwide patent portfolio of issued and pending patents these patents together with proprietary technical knowhow are significant to our competitive position particularly with regard to propylene oxide performance chemicals petrochemicals and polymers including process technologies such as spheripol  spherizone  hostalen  spherilene  lupotech t and avant catalyst family technology rights we rely on the patent copyright and trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing however we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without authorization proceedings to protect these rights could be costly and we may not prevail 

the protection afforded by patents varies from country to country and depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage while a presumption of validity exists with respect to patents issued to us our patents may be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable as patents expire the products and processes described and claimed under those patents become generally available for use by competitors 

our continued growth strategy may bring us to regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce in addition patent rights may not prevent our competitors from 

  

developing using or selling products that are similar or functionally equivalent to our products moreover our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner which could result in significantly lower revenues reduced profit margins or loss of market share 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary knowhow and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property these confidentiality agreements may be breached may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies may not be available additionally others could obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal or illegal means 

the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes apparatuses technology trade secrets or proprietary knowhow could result in significantly lower revenues reduced profit margins and cash flows andor loss of market share we also may be subject to claims that our technology patents or other intellectual property infringes on a third party’s intellectual property rights unfavorable resolution of these claims could result in restrictions on our ability to deliver the related service or in a settlement that could be material to us 

shared control or lack of control of joint ventures may delay decisions or actions regarding the joint ventures 

a portion of our operations are conducted through joint ventures where control may be exercised by or shared with unaffiliated third parties we cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners including any nonperformance default or bankruptcy of joint venture partners the joint ventures that we do not control may also lack adequate internal controls systems or financial reporting systems to provide adequate and timely information for our reporting purposes 

in the event that any of our joint venture partners do not observe their obligations it is possible that the affected joint venture would not be able to operate in accordance with our business plans as a result we could be required to increase our level of commitment in order to give effect to such plans differences in views among the joint venture participants also may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major matters potentially adversely affecting the business and operations of the joint ventures and in turn our business and operations 

we cannot predict with certainty the extent of future costs under environmental health and safety and other laws and regulations and cannot guarantee they will not be material 

we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture handle or own in addition because our products are components of a variety of other enduse products we along with other members of the chemical industry are subject to potential claims related to those enduse products any substantial increase in the success of these types of claims could negatively affect our operating results 

we together with the industries in which we operate are subject to extensive national regional state and local environmental laws regulations directives rules and ordinances concerning 

 

  

  

   

many of these laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations in addition some of these laws and regulations require us to meet specific financial responsibility requirements any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

although we have compliance programs and other processes intended to ensure compliance with all such regulations we are subject to the risk that our compliance with such regulations could be challenged noncompliance with certain of these regulations could result in the incurrence of additional costs penalties or assessments that could be material 

our industry is subject to extensive government regulation and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures 

compliance with regulatory requirements could result in higher operating costs such as regulatory requirements relating to emissions the security of our facilities and the transportation export or registration of our products we generally expect that regulatory controls worldwide will become increasingly more demanding but cannot accurately predict future developments 

increasingly strict environmental laws and inspection and enforcement policies could affect the handling manufacture use emission or disposal of products other materials or hazardous and nonhazardous waste stricter environmental safety and health laws regulations and enforcement policies could result in increased operating costs or capital expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations additionally we are required to have permits for our businesses and are subject to licensing regulations these permits and licenses are subject to renewal modification and in some circumstances revocation further the permits and licenses are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

we may incur substantial costs to comply with climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives 

there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas “ghg” reduction these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future laws in this field continue to evolve and while they are likely to be increasingly widespread and stringent at this stage it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation within the framework of eu emissions trading we were allocated certain allowances of carbon dioxide per year for the affected plants of our european sites for the 2005 to 2007 period for the second trading period 2008 to 2012 a number of our plants were included in the europewide trading system we expect to incur additional costs as a result of the existing emissions trading scheme including the third trading period starting in 2013 and could incur additional costs in relation to any future carbon or other greenhouse gas emission trading schemes the costs could be higher to the extent that we decide to sell credits that we need in the future 

in the us the environmental protection agency the “epa” has promulgated federal ghg regulations under the clean air act affecting certain sources the epa has issued mandatory ghg reporting requirements requirements to obtain ghg permits for certain industrial plants and proposals for ghg performance standards for some facilities the recent epa action could be a precursor to further federal regulation of carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases and may affect the outcome of other climate change lawsuits pending in us federal courts in a manner unfavorable to our industry in any event additional regulation may be forthcoming at the us federal or state level with respect to ghg emissions and such regulation could result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances 

compliance with these or other changes in laws regulations and obligations that create a ghg emissions trading scheme or ghg reduction policies generally could significantly increase our costs or reduce demand for 

  

products we produce additionally compliance with these regulations may result in increased permitting necessary for the operation of our business or for any of our growth plans difficulties in obtaining such permits could have an adverse effect on our future growth therefore any future potential regulations and legislation could result in increased compliance costs additional operating restrictions or delays in implementing growth projects or other capital investments and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may be required to record material charges against our earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets 

we may be required to reduce production at or idle facilities for extended periods of time or exit certain businesses as a result of the cyclical nature of our industry specifically oversupplies of or lack of demand for particular products or high raw material prices may cause us to reduce production we may choose to reduce production at certain facilities because we have offtake arrangements at other facilities which make any reductions or idling unavailable at those facilities any decision to permanently close facilities or exit a business likely would result in impairment and other charges to earnings 

temporary outages at our facilities can last for several quarters and sometimes longer these outages could cause us to incur significant costs including the expenses of maintaining and restarting these facilities in addition even though we may reduce production at facilities we may be required to continue to purchase or pay for utilities or raw materials under takeorpay supply agreements 

our business is capital intensive and we rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and ongoing capital needs limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results 

we require significant capital to operate our current business and fund our growth strategy moreover interest payments dividends and the expansion of our business or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital we believe that our cash from operations currently will be sufficient to meet these needs however if we need external financing our access to credit markets and pricing of our capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies and the state of the capital markets generally there can be no assurances that we would be able to incur indebtedness on terms we deem acceptable and it is possible that the cost of any financings could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities which could adversely affect our operating results 

we may use our fiveyear 20 billion revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs to the extent available as of december 31 2012 we had no borrowings and 48 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the facility leaving an unused and available credit capacity of 1949 million in the event of a default under our credit facility or any of our senior notes we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do any default under any of our credit arrangements could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate 

certain activities related to a former project raise compliance issues under us law 

we have identified an agreement related to a former project in kazakhstan under which a payment was made that raises compliance concerns under the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” we have engaged outside counsel to investigate these activities under the oversight of the audit committee of the supervisory board and to evaluate internal controls and compliance policies and procedures we made a 

  

voluntary disclosure of these matters to the us department of justice and are cooperating fully with that agency we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters at this time since our investigations are ongoing in this respect we may not have conducted business in compliance with the fcpa and may not have had policies and procedures in place adequate to ensure compliance therefore we cannot reasonably estimate a range of liability for any potential penalty resulting from these matters violations of these laws could result in criminal and civil liabilities and other forms of penalties or sanctions that could be material to us 

legislation and regulatory initiatives could lead to a decrease in demand for our products 

new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health safety and the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products initiatives by governments and private interest groups will potentially require increased toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us for example in the united states the national toxicology program “ntp” is a federal interagency program that seeks to identify and select for study chemicals and other substances to evaluate potential human health hazards in the european union reach is regulation designed to identify the intrinsic properties of chemical substances assess hazards and risks of the substances and identify and implement the risk management measures to protect humans and the environment 

assessments under ntp reach or similar programs or regulations in other jurisdictions may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals we use or produce and may result in additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of those chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

a substantial portion of our ordinary shares are owned by a few persons and their interests in lyondellbasell industries nv may conflict with other stakeholders’ interests 

as of february 1 2013 two separate groups of affiliated shareholders collectively own approximately 34 of our outstanding ordinary shares under dutch law there are no quorum requirements for shareholder voting and most matters are approved or adopted by a majority of votes cast as a result as long as these shareholders or any other substantial shareholder own directly or indirectly a substantial portion of our outstanding shares they will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring shareholder approval including amendments to our articles of association the election of directors significant corporate transactions dividend payments and other matters these shareholders may have interests that conflict with other stakeholders including holders of our notes and actions may be taken that other stakeholders do not view as beneficial 

additionally these shareholders are party to nomination agreements that entitle each of the shareholders to cause our supervisory board to nominate for election members to our supervisory board for so long as the shareholder owns specified percentages of our ordinary shares 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the identification and development of talent to succeed senior management 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and we rely heavily on our management team the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations in addition because of the reliance on our management team our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management the retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our strategies 

  

we may not be able to fully or successfully implement our ongoing plans to improve and globally integrate our business processes and functions 

we continue to seek ways to drive greater productivity flexibility and cost savings in particular we are working towards the improvement and global integration of our business processes and functions as part of these efforts we have been centralizing certain functions implementing new information technology and integrating our existing information technology systems 

our ongoing implementation of organizational improvements is made more difficult by our need to coordinate geographically dispersed operations inabilities and delays in implementing improvements can negatively affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings in addition the process of organizational improvements may cause interruptions of or loss of momentum in the activities of our businesses it may also result in the loss of personnel or other labor issues these issues as well as any information technology systems failures also could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 

additionally from time to time certain aspects of our business processes may be outsourced to third parties the processes or the portions thereof that are outsourced generally will tend to be labor intensive transactional activities although we make a diligent effort to ensure that all providers of outsourced services observe proper internal control practices and procedures we cannot assure that failures will not occur the failure of such third parties to provide adequate services could adversely affect our results of operations liquidity or our ability to provide adequate financial and management reporting 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may adversely affect the valuation of pension obligations the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets may result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets particularly equity securities or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets any change in key actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate would impact the valuation of pension obligations affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years 

certain of our current pension plans have projected benefit obligations that exceed the fair value of the plan assets as of december 31 2012 the aggregate deficit was 1121 million any declines in the fair values of the pension plans assets could require additional payments by us in order to maintain specified funding levels 

our pension plans are subject to legislative and regulatory requirements of applicable jurisdictions which could include under certain circumstances local governmental authority to terminate the plan 

our operations could be adversely affected by labor relations 

the vast majority of our employees located in europe and south america are represented by labor unions and works councils approximately 800 of our employees located in north america are represented by labor unions 

our operations have been in the past and may be in the future significantly and adversely affected by strikes work stoppages and other labor disputes

we maintain an extensive patent portfolio and continue to file new patent applications in the us and other countries as of december 31 2012 we owned approximately 5000 patents and patent applications worldwide our patents and trade secrets cover our processes products and catalysts and are significant to our competitive 

  

position particularly with regard to po intermediate chemicals petrochemicals polymers and our process technologies we own globally registered and unregistered trademarks including the “lyondellbasell” “lyondell” and “equistar” trade names while we believe that our intellectual property provides competitive advantages we do not regard our businesses as being materially dependent upon any single patent trade secret or trademark some of our heritage production capacity operates under licenses from third parties 

environmental 

regulation 

we are subject to extensive international national state local and environmental laws regulations directives rules and ordinances and are required to have permits and licenses concerning emissions to the air discharges onto land or waters and the generation handling storage transportation treatment disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials 

under the european union integrated pollution prevention and control directive “ippc” eu member state governments are to adopt rules and implement an environmental permitting program relating to air water and waste for individual facilities the eu countries are at varying stages in their respective implementation of the ippc permit program we do not know with certainty what future ippc permits will require or the future costs of compliance with the ippc permit program the eu also has passed legislation governing the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals known as reach pursuant to which we are required to register chemicals and gain authorization for the use of certain substances as an importer of chemicals and materials from outside the eu we are subject to additional registration obligations 

we also are subject to environmental laws that may have a significant effect on the nature and scope of cleanup of contamination at current and former operating facilities and at other sites at which hazardous substances generated by our current or former subsidiaries were disposed such laws may also have a significant effect on the costs of transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products and the costs of the storage and disposal of wastewater in the us the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended and also known as superfund “cercla” imposes joint and several liability for the costs of remedial investigations and cleanup actions as well as damages to natural resources on entities that generated hazardous substances arranged for disposal of the hazardous substances transported to or selected the disposal sites and the past and present owners and operators of such sites all such responsible parties or any one of them can be required to bear all of such costs regardless of fault the legality of the original disposal or ownership of the disposal site we are subject to potential liability under cercla as an owner or operator of facilities at which hazardous substances have been disposed or as a generator or transporter of hazardous substances disposed at other locations 

under the eu environmental liability directive eu member states can require the remediation of soil and groundwater contamination in certain circumstances under the “polluter pays principle” the scope of events and circumstances that could trigger remediation requirements and the level of remediation required vary from member state to member state 

under the us resource conservation and recovery act of 1976 various us state and nonus government regulations regulate the handling transporting and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous waste our manufacturing sites have and may in the future handle onsite waste disposal subjecting us to these laws and regulations 

capital expenditures 

in some cases compliance with environmental health and safety laws and regulations can only be achieved by capital expenditures regulatoryrelated capital expenditures at our facilities were 159 million in 2012 and we estimate such expenditures to be approximately 157 million in 2013 and 194 million in 2014 

  

our regulatoryrelated capital expenditures in 2012 primarily relate to projects designed to reduce and control emissions from our plant operations in both the us and europe 

stricter environmental safety and health laws regulations and enforcement policies could result in increased environmental capital expenditures by us above current estimates 

employee relations 

as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 13500 fulltime and parttime employees of these approximately 5800 were in north america approximately 6600 were in europe and approximately 1100 were in other locations 

as of december 31 2012 approximately 800 of our employees in north america were represented by labor unions the vast majority of our employees in europe and south america are subject to staff council or works council coverage or collective bargaining agreements 

in addition to our own employees we use the services of contractors in the routine conduct of our businesses 

we believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend general 

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report when we use the terms “we” “us” “our” or similar words in this discussion unless the context otherwise requires we are referring to lyondellbasell industries nv and its consolidated subsidiaries we also refer to the company as “lyondellbasell nv” the “successor company” and the “successor” 

in addition to comparisons of current operating results with the same period in the prior year we have included as additional disclosure certain “trailing quarter” comparisons of fourth quarter 2012 operating results to third quarter 2012 operating results our businesses’ results are impacted by seasonal effects and are highly cyclical trailing quarter comparisons may offer important insight into current business direction 

references to industry benchmark prices or costs including the weighted average cost of ethylene production are generally to industry prices and costs from thirdparty consulting data references to industry benchmarks for refining and oxyfuels market margins are to industry prices reported by platts a reporting service of the mcgrawhill companies references to industry benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas are to bloomberg 

overview 

our performance is driven by among other things global economic conditions generally and their impact on demand for our products raw material and energy prices and industryspecific issues such as production capacity our businesses are generally subject to the cyclicality and volatility seen in the chemicals and refining industries 

our ability to maintain strong performance in a volatile economic environment including continued uncertainties caused by recessionary conditions in europe and the reduced growth outlook for china is reflected in our 2012 results of operations we continue to focus on safe reliable operations cost reductions particularly in europe and disciplined growth we believe this strategy allows us to generate solid results even while facing challenges due to external factors significant items that affected 2012 results include 

 

  

  

 other noteworthy items during 2012 include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

following the company’s emergence from bankruptcy on may 1 2010 we adopted freshstart accounting to ensure a proper analysis of the year over year results the effects of freshstart accounting on the successor period are specifically addressed throughout this discussion references in the following discussions to the “company” for periods prior to april 30 2010 the emergence date are to the predecessor company lyondellbasell af and for periods after the emergence date to the successor company lyondellbasell nv for additional information on the impact of our reorganization on our results please see the “ emergence ” section below 

results of operations for the successor and predecessor periods discussed in these “results of operations” are presented in the table below 

 

 results of operations 

revenues —we had revenues of 45352 million in 2012 48183 million in 2011 and 38939 million in 2010 revenues decreased 2831 million or 6 in 2012 compared to 2011 lower sales volumes were responsible for a 2 decrease in revenues in 2012 while lower average product prices contributed 4 to the revenue decrease in 2012 lower ngl feedstock prices contributed to the lower average sales prices for olefins and polyolefins in the op—americas segment sales volumes in 2012 were lower than in 2011 primarily in european olefins and polyethylene and in refining weak economic conditions in europe turnaround activity at our cracker in wesseling germany and the resale of crude oil in 2011 to take advantage of favorable crude purchases were the main factors in the reduced level of sales volumes in 2012 

revenues in 2011 increased 9244 million or 24 compared to 2010 higher average sales prices which reflect higher crude oil prices higher raw material costs and improved supplydemand fundamentals in the op—americas and id segments were responsible for a 19 increase in revenues the effect of higher sales volumes primarily at the houston refinery was responsible for a 5 increase in revenues 

cost of sales —cost of sales were 39595 million in 2012 42732 million in 2011 and 34927 million in 2010 the 3137 million decrease in cost of sales in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to lower prices of nglbased raw materials particularly ethane used in north american olefins and the lower prices of ethylene and propylene used in north american polyolefins falling raw material costs including butane 

  

methanol and ethanol used in oxyfuels also benefited costs of sales in the id segment these lower costs were partially offset by higher naphtha feedstock costs in the op–eai segment and higher crude oil prices in the refining segment 

the 7805 million increase in cost of sales in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to higher raw material costs which reflect higher prices for crude oil and other hydrocarbons compared to 2010 cost of sales for 2011 included a benefit from 187 million of lower depreciation and amortization in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the 7474 million writedown of property plant and equipment associated with the april 2010 revaluation of our assets in freshstart accounting the 2010 successor period included a 64 million noncash charge as a change in estimate related to a dispute that arose during the third quarter 2010 over an environmental liability 

operating income —the company had operating income of 4676 million 4337 million and 2996 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the increase in operating income in 2012 compared to 2011 reflects strong ethylene performance in our op—americas segment and higher oxyfuels margins operating results which increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily reflect higher product margins for ethylene butanediol eo and derivatives and acetyls as well as higher refining margins at our houston refinery 

operating results in 2011 and in the 2010 successor period also benefited from lower depreciation and amortization expense of 192 million and 651 million respectively as a result of the writedown of property plant and equipment associated with the revaluation of our assets in freshstart accounting in april 2010 

operating results for each of our business segments are reviewed further in the “segment analysis” section below 

interest expense —interest expense was 655 million in 2012 1044 million in 2011 and 1250 million in 2010 the 389 million decrease in interest expense in 2012 compared to 2011 reflects the refinancing of our notes bearing interest rates of 8 and 11 per annum with lower coupon notes the resulting benefit was offset in part by the payment of 294 million of premiums and the writeoff of 18 million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the refinancing additionally we wrote off 17 million of capitalized debt issuance costs in connection with the termination of our abl credit facility in may 2012 

the 206 million decrease in interest expense in 2011 compared to 2010 reflects the repayment of 4288 million principal amount of debt since the beginning of the fourth quarter 2010 partially offset by 443 million of prepayment premiums and unamortized debt issuance cost writeoffs related to the 2011 repayments the prepayment of debt in 2011 included 1731 million of our 8 senior notes 1319 million of our 11 senior notes interest expense for 2011 also includes interest on our newly issued 6 senior notes due 2021 

other income expense net— the company had other income net of 2 million in 2012 and 30 million in 2011 and other expense net of 361 million in 2010 

other income net in 2011 included gains of 41 million related to the sale of excess precious metals 15 million related to the sale of scrap at one of our plants and 15 million related to a settlement associated with the july 2008 crane incident at our houston refinery these gains were partially offset by the negative effect of the 37 million fair value adjustment of the warrants to purchase our shares and 17 million of foreign exchange losses 

other expense net in 2010 included the negative effect of the fair value adjustment of the warrants to purchase our shares of 114 million and foreign exchange losses of 233 million 

income loss from equity investments —the company had income from equity investments totaling 143 million in 2012 216 million in 2011 and 170 million in 2010 the 73 million decrease in 2012 compared to 2011 was due to the lower operating results of our joint ventures in the middle east and asia which were driven by lower average sales prices higher raw material costs and unplanned outages 

  

the 46 million increase in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily reflects the addition of capacity at our hmc joint venture in late 2010 and the operations of our joint venture in ningbo china which commenced operations in june 2010 the benefit of these joint ventures was partially offset by the lower results of our joint venture located in poland 

reorganization items —the company had income from reorganization items of 7101 million in 2010 gains from reorganization items in the 2010 predecessor period included gains totaling 13617 million related to settlement of liabilities subject to compromise deconsolidation of entities upon emergence adjustments related to rejected contracts and a reduction of environmental remediation liabilities these gains were partially offset by a charge of 6542 million related to the changes in net assets resulting from the application of freshstart accounting and by several onetime emergence costs including the success and other fees earned by certain professionals upon the company’s emergence from bankruptcy damages related to the rejection of executory contracts and plant closure costs reorganization items expense in the 2010 successor period is primarily related to professional fees 

income tax —our effective income tax rates of 317 and 300 in 2012 and 2011 respectively resulted in tax provisions of 1327 million and 1059 million on pretax income of 4185 million and 3531 million respectively in the eight months ended december 31 2010 the successor recorded a tax provision of 170 million representing an effective tax rate of 98 on pretax income of 1731 million in the four months ended april 30 2010 the predecessor recorded a tax benefit of 1315 million representing a negative effective tax rate of 189 on pretax income of 6947 million 

the 2012 effective income tax rate which was lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35 reflected the effects of income being taxed in countries with lower statutory income tax rates and favorable permanent deductions related to notional royalties equity earnings the us domestic production activity deduction and changes to the valuation allowance partially offset by the effect of local taxes the effective income tax rate for 2011 was lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35 primarily due to the effect of income being taxed in countries with lower statutory income tax rates and favorable permanent deductions related to notional royalties equity earnings and the us domestic production activity deduction the provision for the 2010 successor period differs from the us statutory income tax rate of 35 primarily due to the fact that in several countries the company generated either income with no tax expense or losses where we recorded no tax benefit due to valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets in those countries the tax provision for the 2010 predecessor period was significantly lower than the us statutory income tax rate primarily because a substantial portion of the pretax gain from the discharge of prepetition liabilities was not subject to income tax this benefit was partially offset by restructuring charges for which no tax benefit was provided 

income from continuing operations —income from continuing operations was 2858 million in 2012 2472 million in 2011 and 9823 million in 2010 the following table summarizes the major components contributing to our income from continuing operations 

 

   

the table below summarizes items of special note with regards to our income from continuing operations for the periods shown 

 

 income loss from discontinued operations net of tax— the improvement in the results of our discontinued operations in 2012 compared to 2011 reflect a benefit from the suspension of operations at the berre refinery in early january 2012 as well as pretax benefits totaling 73 million related to the liquidation of product inventory during 2012 results for 2011 also included charges related to the berre refinery of 130 million and 31 million respectively associated with the estimated cost of the social plan for affected employees and asset impairments 

lower results at the berre refinery were responsible for the decline in our 2011 results of discontinued operations compared to 2010 which included a 64 million gain in the 2010 successor period related to the sale of our flavor and fragrance chemicals business in addition to the effect of lower refining margins at the berre refinery in 2011 compared to 2010 results for the berre refinery also reflected the impact of the 2011 charges described above and a 264 million pretax benefit in 2010 associated with the fair value adjustment of our berre refinery inventory recognized upon the application of fresh start accounting 

comprehensive income— comprehensive income increased by 1225 million in 2012 compared to 2011 and decreased by 8597 million in 2011 compared to 2010 the increase in comprehensive income in 2012 mainly reflected an increase in net income and to a lesser extent foreign currency translation adjustments and actuarial losses related to our defined benefit pension plans and our other postretirement benefit plans that were lower in 2012 compared to 2011 the predominant local currency of our operations outside the united states is the euro which has increased relative to the value of the us dollar 

  

the predominant factor contributing to the decrease seen in 2011 was the 8376 million aftertax income in the 2010 predecessor period related to reorganization items reorganization items in this period included a pretax gain on discharge of liabilities subject to compromise of 13617 million offset in part by a pretax charge of 6542 million related to the change in net asset value resulting from the application of fresh start accounting on the emergence date 

fourth quarter 2012 versus third quarter 2012 —the company had income from continuing operations of 645 million in the fourth quarter compared to 851 million in the third quarter which included a 71 million pretax benefit related to the reversal of the second quarter lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment due to market price recovery in the third quarter third quarter results also included a 24 million recovery related to a former employee who pled guilty to fraud the decrease in income from continuing operations was primarily due to lower results in our op—eai segment and id segments fourth quarter segment results for our op—eai segment reflected lower polyolefins and pp compounding margins which were offset in part by higher olefins margins lower oxyfuels margins and sales volumes contributed to the decrease in the id segment operating results these decreases were partially offset by higher results in our op—americas segment which benefited from higher ethylene margins that resulted from lower ngl feedstock costs and higher average sales prices underlying operations of our refining segment were relatively unchanged between the two periods 

emergence 

lyondellbasell nv the successor holding company owns and operates directly and indirectly substantially the same business owned and operated by lyondellbasell af prior to the company’s emergence from bankruptcy however for accounting purposes the operations of lyondellbasell af are deemed to have ceased on april 30 2010 and lyondellbasell nv is deemed to have begun operations on that date effective may 1 2010 we adopted freshstart accounting consequently the results of operations for the successor are not comparable to the predecessor due to adjustments made under freshstart accounting 

the primary impacts of our reorganization pursuant to the plan of reorganization and the adoption of freshstart accounting on our results of operations are as follows 

tax impact of reorganization —the application of the tax provisions of the internal revenue code to the plan of reorganization resulted in the reduction or elimination of the majority of our us tax attributes that otherwise would have carried forward into 2011 and later years as a result we did not retain any us net operating loss carryforwards alternative minimum tax credits or capital loss carryforwards after 2010 in addition a significant portion of our tax basis in depreciable assets was eliminated accordingly our cash tax liabilities for 2012 and 2011 were relatively higher than in 2010 we retained approximately 2500 million of interest carryforwards at december 31 2010 which were fully utilized to offset taxable income in 2011 and 2012 

inventory —we adopted the last in first out “lifo” method of accounting for inventory upon implementation of freshstart accounting prior to the emergence from bankruptcy lyondellbasell af used both the first in first out “fifo” and lifo methods of accounting to determine inventory cost for purposes of evaluating segment results management reviewed operating results for lyondellbasell af that were determined using current cost which approximates results using the lifo method of accounting for inventory subsequent to the emergence date our operating results are reviewed using the lifo method of accounting for inventory while determining the impact of the adoption of lifo on predecessor periods is not practicable we believe that the current cost method used by the predecessor for segment reporting is similar to lifo and the current cost method would have resulted in a decrease of cost of sales of 199 million for the four months ended april 30 2010 

  

in addition on may 1 2010 pursuant to accounting standard codification “asc” topic 852 reorganizations  we recorded inventory at fair value in the 2010 successor period lower market prices primarily for polypropylene resulted in a 42 million lower of cost or market charge to adjust the value of our finished goods inventory to market the effect of this adjustment to the value of our inventory is reflected in cost of sales for the 2010 successor period 

depreciation and amortization expense —depreciation and amortization expense is lower in the successor periods as a result of our revaluation of assets for freshstart accounting depreciation and amortization as reported for all periods presented is as follows 

 

 interest expense —lower interest expense in the 2010 successor period was largely driven by the discharge or repayment of debt upon which interest was accruing during the bankruptcy through the company’s reorganization on april 30 2010 pursuant to the plan of reorganization partially offset by interest expense on the new debt incurred as part of the emergence from bankruptcy interest expense in 2011 which was lower compared to the combined 2010 successor and predecessor periods reflects the repayment of 4288 million principal amount of debt since the beginning of the fourth quarter 2010 this benefit was partially offset by the premiums and other costs associated with the prepayments as well as interest expense on the senior 6 notes issued in november 2011 interest expense continued to decline in 2012 following the refinancing of notes bearing interest rates of 8 and 11 per annum with lower coupon notes in the second quarter of 2012 the benefit of these lower interest rates was partially offset by premiums and other costs related to the repayment of the 8 and 11 notes 

 

 segment analysis 

our continuing operations are divided into five reportable segments op—americas op—eai id refining and technology in the second quarter 2012 the operations of our berre refinery in france met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations and our oxyfuels business which was previously managed in conjunction with our refining operations and included in our refining segment was included in our id segment all comparable periods presented have been revised accordingly 

  

the following tables reflect selected financial information for our reportable segments 

 

 olefins and polyolefins—americas segment 

2012 versus 2011 —the us ethylene industry continues to benefit from processing comparably low cost ngls ethylene produced from ngls in north america is currently lower in cost compared to that produced from crude oilbased liquids which is the predominant feedstock used in the rest of the world 

higher operating results for 2012 were driven by continued strong ethylene performance ethylene margins improved in 2012 despite a decrease in the average price of ethylene as prices for ethane and propane remained advantaged higher sales volumes in 2012 for ethylene reflect higher demand polypropylene and polyethylene results which reflected higher margins and moderately higher sales volumes also contributed to the higher segment results 

2011 versus 2010 —ethylene margins remained strong in 2011 primarily due to advantaged prices for ethane which was the favored feedstock coproduct sales prices which remained high in 2011 despite a fourth quarter decline also contributed to the strength of ethylene margins market demand for polyethylene was relatively unchanged in 2011 but higher prices driven by increased raw material costs dampened demand for us polypropylene 

  

operating results for 2011 and the 2010 successor period include the impacts of freshstart accounting including the benefit of lower depreciation and amortization expense related to the writedown of segment assets the 2010 successor period also includes the negative impact of a noncash charge to adjust inventory to market value see “results of operationscost of sales” 

ethylene raw materials —benchmark crude oil and natural gas prices generally have been indicators of the level and direction of the movement of raw material and energy costs for ethylene and its coproducts in the op—americas segment ethylene and its coproducts are produced from two major raw material groups 

 

  

 although prices of these raw materials are generally related to crude oil and natural gas prices during specific periods the relationships among these materials and benchmarks may vary significantly in the us we have significant capability to change the mix of raw materials used in the production of ethylene and its coproducts to take advantage of the relative costs of heavy liquids and ngls 

production economics for the industry continued to favor ngls during 2012 and 2011 as a result we further increased our use of ngls and reduced liquids consumption at our us plants approximately 85 of our us ethylene production was produced from ngls during 2012 compared to approximately 75 in 2011 and 70 in 2010 

the following table shows the average us benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas for the applicable periods as well as benchmark us sales prices for ethylene and propylene which we produce and sell or consume internally the table also shows the discounted us benchmark prices for certain polyethylene and polypropylene products the benchmark weighted average cost of ethylene production which reflects credits for coproduct sales is based on a thirdparty consultant’s estimated ratio of heavy liquid raw materials and ngls used in us ethylene production 

 

   

the following table sets forth the op—americas segment’s sales and other operating revenues operating income income from equity investments and selected product production and sales volumes production volumes are based on actual production in the time period 

 

 revenues —revenues decreased by 1946 million or 13 in 2012 compared to 2011 and increased by 2291 million or 18 in 2011 compared to 2010 in 2012 lower average sales prices across most products were responsible for a 9 decrease in revenue and lower sales volumes were responsible for an additional 4 decrease in revenue average sales prices for ethylene and polyethylene were lower in 2012 mainly due to the significantly lower costs of ngl feedstocks lower average sales prices for polypropylene in 2012 reflected lower propylene prices compared to a strong propylene market in 2011 the overall decrease in sales volumes reflects the increased amount of ngls in our olefins feed slate in 2012 as ngls produce significantly less coproducts than liquids feedstock sales volumes of the main products in the segment ethylene polyethylene and polypropylene actually increased in 2012 over 2011 levels the increase in ethylene sales volumes was driven by improved demand and higher spot sales opportunities in 2012 the higher polyethylene sales volumes in 2012 reflect an increase in market share 

higher average sales prices for most products in 2011 were responsible for revenue increases of 22 while lower sales volumes reduced revenues by 4 in 2011 compared to 2010 an improved supplydemand balance and higher crudeoil based raw material costs were reflected in the higher average sales prices in 2011 

operating income —operating results reflected increases of 795 million in 2012 compared to 2011 and 499 million in 2011 compared to 2010 

the increase in operating income in 2012 primarily reflects strong ethylene performance which resulted in higher margins and sales volumes and to a lesser extent higher results for polyethylene and polypropylene a significant benefit to the cost of ethylene production in 2012 from lower ethane and propane prices was offset in part by lower average sales prices for coproducts margins increased as the cost reduction was only partly offset by lower average ethylene sales prices polyethylene and polypropylene saw higher product margins and sales volumes in 2012 the higher margins for polyethylene and polypropylene reflect decreases in the prices for ethylene and propylene respectively that outpaced decreases in average sales prices operating results for 2012 also reflected a 29 million benefit associated with an insurance settlement related to hurricane ike 

the 499 million increase in operating results for 2011 was primarily due to higher ethylene product margins which were partially offset by lower product margins for polyethylene and polypropylene and lower ethylene and polypropylene sales volumes the higher ethylene margins reflected increases in the average sales prices of ethylene and ethylene coproducts during 2011 which more than offset increases in raw material prices polyethylene and polypropylene product margins were lower in 2011 compared to 2010 as increases in raw material costs outpaced the increases in average sales prices operating results for 2011 were negatively 

  

impacted by a major turnaround at our channelview plant and a utility supplier outage at our morris illinois facility as well as planned and unplanned outages at our polypropylene plants operating results for 2011 benefited from 64 million of lower depreciation expense compared to 2010 as a result of the application of freshstart accounting and the revaluation of our assets while the 2010 successor period results were negatively impacted by a 34 million noncash charge to adjust inventory to market value 

fourth quarter 2012 versus third quarter 2012 —operating income decreased from 738 million in the third quarter to 693 million in the fourth quarter third quarter operating results include a 71 million noncash benefit resulting from the recovery of market price which reversed the 71 million lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment recognized in the second quarter 

results of the underlying operations of the opamericas segment reflect higher ethylene results which were offset in part by lower margins for polyethylene and polypropylene and lower polypropylene sales volumes compared to the third quarter the higher ethylene results reflect an improvement in ethylene margins lower ngl prices coupled with higher average sales prices for ethylene were the primary drivers of the improved ethylene margins fourth quarter polyethylene margins were lower compared to the third quarter due to higher feedstock costs these costs rose with the price of ethylene and outpaced the average sales price increases for polyethylene sales volumes for polyethylene were relatively flat between the two periods operational issues at one of our facilities which have been resolved led to the lower level of polypropylene sales volumes in the fourth quarter 

olefins and polyolefins—europe asia and international segment 

2012 versus 2011 —market conditions particularly in europe continued to be weak throughout 2012 amid economic uncertainty this resulted in a decline for european demand for ethylene and polyolefins in 2012 compared to 2011 the volatility of naphtha feedstock prices throughout 2012 resulted in substantial swings in olefins margins over this period 

operating results in 2012 primarily reflected weak margins and lower sales volumes across most products the decrease in sales volumes reflects weak european demand and the negative impact of reduced production during the last half of 2012 from a turnaround at our wesseling germany cracker the volatility in naphtha feedstock price noted above resulted in volume volatility compressed margins for most of the year and considerably lower butadiene margins in 2012 polypropylene and polyethylene results were lower in 2012 reflecting lower product margins and lower polyethylene sales volumes results for our pp compounding and polybutene1 businesses were slightly higher in 2012 compared to 2011 

2011 versus 2010 —market conditions which were strong in the first half of 2011 began to deteriorate in the third quarter and continued to decline rapidly in the fourth quarter of 2011 the decline was most evident in europe amid uncertainty and poor economic conditions an industry wide inventory adjustment that occurred during the fourth quarter 2011 as producers drew down existing inventories led to a decline in prices from the high levels experienced earlier in the year despite lower market demand for ethylene in 2011 industry margins for ethylene expanded as benchmark average sales prices increased more than the benchmark weighted average cost of ethylene production market demand for polyolefins was lower in 2011 compared to 2010 

despite a lower second half of 2011 operating results in 2011 for the op—eai segment reflected higher product margins for ethylene and especially butadiene and higher sales volumes across most products compared to 2010 segment results in 2011 also benefited from the continued strong performance of our pp compounding business results for the 2010 successor period include the negative impact of a charge related to a change in estimate associated with a dispute over an environmental indemnity while 2011 results include charges associated with activities to reorganize certain functional organizations and for increased environmental liabilities at our wesseling germany site 

  

ethylene raw materials —in europe heavy liquids are the primary raw materials for our ethylene production 

the following table shows the average western europe benchmark prices for brent crude oil for the applicable periods as well as benchmark western europe prices for ethylene and propylene which we produce and consume internally or purchase from unrelated suppliers and discounted prices for certain polyethylene and polypropylene products 

 

 the following table sets forth the op—eai segment’s sales and other operating revenues operating income income from equity investments and selected product production and sales volumes production volumes are based on the actual production in the time period 

 

 revenues —revenues for 2012 decreased by 1070 million or 7 compared to revenues for 2011 and revenues for 2011 increased by 2615 million or 20 compared to revenues for 2010 lower average sales prices in 2012 contributed 6 to the revenue decrease and lower sales volumes were responsible for the remaining revenue decrease of 1 the lower average sales prices and sales volumes reflect weak economic conditions in europe that have existed since late 2011 in addition polyethylene sales volumes were affected by an explosion in a reactor bay at our ldpe plant in wesseling germany that occurred during the first quarter 2012 

the increase in 2011 revenues compared to 2010 was due to higher average product sales prices which were mainly driven by higher raw material costs sales volumes in 2011 decreased slightly as a decline in polypropylene sales was offset by increases in other product areas but sales volumes in the second half of 2011 were significantly lower than in the first half of the year overall the change in 2011 sales volumes did not have a material impact on revenues 

  

operating income —operating results decreased 308 million in 2012 compared to 2011 and by 38 million in 2011 compared to 2010 segment operating results for 2012 included charges of 35 million for restructuring activities in europe and 22 million for impairment of assets related to damage of our ldpe plant in wesseling germany that resulted from an explosion in a reactor bay these charges were partially offset by a 28 million benefit related to the reversal of a reserve established at emergence for an unfavorable monomer contract operating results in 2011 included charges associated with activities to reorganize certain functional organizations and for increased environmental liabilities at our wesseling germany site operating results for the successor period in 2010 were negatively impacted by a 56 million charge associated with a change in estimate that arose during the third quarter 2010 over an environmental indemnity 

excluding the impact of the items occurring in 2012 and 2011 discussed above operating results for 2012 reflect lower cracker and butadiene margins and a 6 decline in olefins production volumes lower butadiene margins were principally due to lower average sales prices in the second half of 2012 compared to the very strong levels in 2011 as supplies outpaced weaker global demand the turnaround at our wesseling germany cracker and the subsequent delay in the startup of activities during the last half of 2012 contributed to the decline in production volumes polyethylene results were lower in 2012 as a result of lower sales volumes and margins polypropylene results were lower in 2012 due to lower margins in europe the lower polyethylene and polypropylene margins reflected decreases in average sales prices that exceeded average decreases in raw material prices the lower polyethylene sales volumes in 2012 reflected lower operating rates which were largely attributable to the wesseling turnaround slightly higher results for our pp compounding and pb1 businesses reflected margins that were higher in 2012 compared to 2011 sales volumes for pp compounding and pb1 were relatively unchanged over the two periods 

apart from the charges occurring in 2011 and 2010 discussed above business results in 2011 reflected higher product margins for butadiene ethylene and to a lesser extent pp compounds and the effect of slightly higher ethylene sales volumes these improvements were substantially offset by lower product margins for polypropylene and polyethylene reflecting higher monomer prices compared to those experienced in 2010 and higher freight and distribution and other costs the strength in butadiene margins reflects strong global demand coupled with constrained supply as a result of a preference in north america for ngl olefins feedstocks which produce less butadiene than liquid feedstocks 

fourth quarter 2012 versus third quarter 2012 —the op—eai segment had an operating loss of 94 million in the fourth quarter compared to operating income of 15 million in the third quarter fourth quarter results included the charges related to the restructuring activities described above and employee compensation these charges were partly offset by the benefit related to the reversal of the reserve associated with the unfavorable contract discussed above apart from these items the decrease in operating results in the fourth quarter was primarily attributed to seasonally lower results for pp compounding and polyolefins which were partly offset by higher olefin results margins for pp compounding returned to more normal levels in the fourth quarter following a strong third quarter as the timing of polypropylene price reductions positively affected third quarter results fourth quarter polyolefins results reflected lower margins due mainly to typical fourth quarter seasonality fourth quarter olefins results reflected higher margins which recovered from the low levels seen in the third quarter and higher sales volumes following the wesseling turnaround 

intermediates and derivatives segment 

2012 versus 2011 —operating results for 2012 reflect strong performance of our oxyfuels business as global gasoline prices remained high relative to butane feedstock costs compared to 2011 and our oxyfuels sales volumes increased as we expanded to new regional markets higher margins for tba and derivatives which reflected higher average sales prices and lower raw material costs also contributed to the higher operating results for the id segment for 2012 these benefits were partially offset by lower results for our po derivatives and lower ethylene glycol margins 

  

2011 versus 2010 —the demand for id products generally remained strong in the first nine months of 2011 significant scheduled maintenance turnarounds at two facilities commenced at the end of the third quarter 2011 and continued into the fourth quarter as the facilities returned to full operations in the fourth quarter demand eroded particularly in europe the decrease in demand reflected typical seasonal declines as well as a weak start to the winter aircraft deicing season id segment results for 2011 reflected higher margins in most product areas especially in oxyfuels butanediol “bdo” acetyls isobutylenes and in eo and derivatives operating results for 2011 reflected the impacts of freshstart accounting including the benefit of lower depreciation and amortization expense for 2011 related to the writedown of segment assets the 2010 successor period includes the negative impact of a noncash charge to adjust inventory to market value see “results of operations—cost of sales” operating results for 2010 also included the operations of our flavors and fragrances business that was sold in december 2010 

the following table sets forth the id segment’s sales and other operating revenues operating income income from equity investments and selected product production and sales volumes production volumes are based on actual production in the time period in addition the table shows mtbe margins in northwest europe “nwe” 

 

 revenues —revenues for 2012 increased 158 million or 2 compared to 2011 this increase in revenues reflects a 1 increase due to higher sales volumes primarily oxyfuels and acetyls and a 1 increase from overall higher average sales prices higher sales volumes for oxyfuels in 2012 reflected strong market demand and expansion into new geographic markets primarily eastern europe increased production resulting from a catalyst replacement earlier this year combined with strong acetyls demand in our european and south american markets contributed to the higher sales volumes for acetyls in 2012 

revenues for 2011 increased 1369 million or 17 compared to 2010 reflecting higher average sales prices across all businesses and the effect of higher sales volumes for eo eg and styrene which more than offset declines in volumes for po  derivatives acetyls and isobutylenes increased demand in the asian automotive and polyester markets and the effect of competitor outages on supply were partially responsible for the higher average sales prices in 2011 the sales volume changes scheduled maintenance turnarounds at two of our facilities in the fourth quarter 2011 higher production from the eoeg facility in a strong global market for most of the year and the yearend slowdown experienced primarily in europe the higher average sales prices resulted in a revenue increase in 2011 of 18 while higher sales volumes resulted in a revenue increase of 2 revenues of our flavors and fragrance chemicals business which was sold in december 2010 comprised 3 of total revenues in 2010 

  

operating income —operating results increased 274 million in 2012 compared to 2011 operating results for 2012 primarily reflect higher oxyfuels margins and sales volumes as a result of the increased spread between gasoline and raw materials butane methanol and ethanol as well as a higher market premium for oxyfuels products over gasoline collective results for po and derivatives were lower as lower product margins for po derivatives were slightly offset by higher po sales volumes po derivatives margins reflect decreases in average sales prices that outpaced lower raw materials prices particularly propylene lower demand for pg used in deicers due to the unseasonably warm start to winter also contributed to the decrease in 2012 po and derivatives results higher tba and derivatives margins in 2012 were partially offset by lower ethylene glycol margins tba and derivative margins reflect lower butane feedstock prices which were related in part to natural gas prices coupled with higher average sales prices the lower ethylene glycol margins reflect average sales prices which decreased more rapidly than the cost of ethylene results for acetyls reflected lower natural gas and ethylene feedstock costs and higher volumes which largely offset lower product sales prices segment operating results for 2012 also included an 18 million benefit related to an insurance settlement associated with hurricane ike 

operating results increased 335 million in 2011 compared to 2010 which primarily reflected higher product margins across all business products especially in po derivatives improved automotive and other durable goods demand and competitor outages contributed to favorable supplydemand fundamentals as prices outpaced increased raw material costs oxyfuels margins were also higher in 2011 compared to 2010 reflecting higher spreads between the prices of gasoline and butane a key raw material operating results in 2011 benefited from lower depreciation and amortization expense of 37 million compared to 2010 primarily due to the writedown of property plant and equipment associated with the revaluation of our assets in freshstart accounting operating results for 2010 also included the results of the flavors  fragrance chemicals business which was sold in december 2010 

fourth quarter 2012 versus third quarter 2012 —operating income was 246 million in the fourth quarter compared to 424 million in the third quarter the decrease in fourth quarter operating results reflects lower oxyfuels margins and lower sales volumes for most products oxyfuels margins were lower in the fourth quarter due to a decrease in the spread between butane and gasoline as demand for high octane clean gasoline components followed seasonal demand patterns which also led to lower sales volumes for oxyfuels in the fourth quarter results for po and derivatives were lower largely due to scheduled turnarounds in the fourth quarter and seasonally weaker demand for po and po derivatives which led to lower sales volumes the collective results for the remaining id segment businesses in the fourth quarter were relatively unchanged from the third quarter 

refining segment 

2012 versus 2011 —the refining segment comprises the operations of our full conversion refinery located on the houston ship channel in houston texas the berre refinery which was previously included in the refining segment through the first quarter of 2012 was classified as discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2012 accordingly results of operations for the berre refinery are not included in the segment discussion 

although the benchmark maya 211 margin increased in 2012 our refinery’s operating results decreased largely as a result of a reduced benefit from favorable crude purchasing opportunities compared to 2011 and lower byproduct spreads for petroleum coke and other natural gasbased products operating results also reflected lower crude processing rates compared to 2011 as a result of planned and unplanned plant outages 

2011 versus 2010 —benchmark us heavy crude refining margins despite declining significantly in the fourth quarter were higher in 2011 as a result of significant discounts for heavy crude oil and increased gasoline and distillate spreads over crude oil for much of the year 

segment operating results were higher in 2011 compared to 2010 despite significantly lower refining margins in the fourth quarter the higher 2011 results primarily reflected higher crude oil refining margins and 

  

increased crude runs at the houston refinery compared to 2010 crude processing rates were higher in 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of unplanned outages during 2010 including the crude unit fire in may 2010 operating results for 2011 and the successor period in 2010 reflect the impacts of freshstart accounting including the benefit of lower depreciation and amortization expense related to the writedown of segment assets 

the following table sets forth the refining segment’s sales and other operating revenues operating income and market refining margins for the us for the applicable periods light louisiana sweet or “lls” and “wti” or west texas intermediate are light crude oils while “maya” is a heavy crude oil 

 

  

 revenues —revenues decreased 415 million or 3 in 2012 compared to 2011 and increased 4396 million or 47 from 2010 to 2011 lower sales volumes in 2012 were responsible for a revenue decrease of 4 compared to 2011 the lower sales volumes reflect the resale of excess crude oil in 2011 in addition crude processing rates were lower in 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of planned and unplanned outages in 2012 a 1 revenue increase from sales prices in 2012 compared to 2011 was driven by the impact of higher gasoline and distillate prices partly offset by lower values for refinery byproducts 

the increase in revenues in 2011 was primarily due to higher average sales prices and higher refining sales volumes higher average sales prices and higher sales volumes were responsible for revenue increases of 30 and 17 respectively crude processing rates were 11 higher compared to 2010 which was negatively impacted by a crude unit fire during the second quarter sulfur constraints unplanned coker unit outages and a supply disruption from a third party utility supplier 

operating income loss —operating results decreased 475 million in 2012 compared to 2011 and increased 698 million in 2011 compared to 2010 in 2012 segment operating results reflected benefits totaling 77 million including a recovery of 24 million related to a former employee who pled guilty to fraud and a 53 million insurance settlement associated with hurricane ike operating results for 2011 reflected benefits totaling 49 million including an insurance recovery related to the fraud mentioned above and a settlement related to the 2008 crane incident at the refinery operating results for 2011 also reflected margins that benefited from favorable crude purchasing opportunities 

excluding the impact of the benefits described above operating income in 2012 decreased largely as a result of lower refining margins despite an increase in the benchmark maya 211 margin our refining margins in 

  

2012 which were lower relative to the maya 211 margin reflected a reduced benefit from favorable crude purchasing opportunities compared to 2011 and lower byproduct spreads for petroleum coke and other natural gasbased products 

the improvement in the 2011 operating results of our underlying operations at the refinery primarily reflects higher refining margins as indicated by the increase in the maya 211 benchmark margin the financial performance of our refining business was favorably impacted by purchasing crude oils at discounts versus the maya reference price for heavy crude oil segment operating results for 2011 included 49 million of benefits described above operating results for 2011 also benefited from lower depreciation expense of 83 million compared to the same 2010 period as a result of the application of freshstart accounting and the revaluation of our assets operating results for 2010 were negatively impacted by a crude unit fire at the refinery in may 2010 resulting in lost production and 14 million of cash costs 

fourth quarter 2012 versus third quarter 2012 —operating income for the fourth quarter was 86 million compared to 114 million in the third quarter which included a 24 million recovery related to a former employee who plead guilty to fraud 

after giving consideration to the 24 million recovery discussed above fourth quarter operating results for the refinery were relatively unchanged from those seen in the third quarter although crude processing rates improved from 240000 barrels per day in the third quarter to 255000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter the maya 211 benchmark margins declined primarily due to weak gasoline product spreads and we incurred higher maintenance costs in the fourth quarter these negative impacts to fourth quarter operating results were substantially offset by a higher heavy crude oil price differential and a lower penalty on petroleum coke and other byproducts as natural gas prices increased unplanned outages during both quarters negatively impacted the crude processing rates 

technology segment 

2012 versus 2011 —operating results in 2012 for the technology segment were lower compared to 2011 the results for both periods were negatively impacted by restructuring activities in europe and in 2011 by an impairment of a research and development project underlying operations of the technology segment in 2012 were relatively unchanged from 2011 

2011 versus 2010 —results for 2011 reflected higher research and development costs primarily related to charges for the impairment of a research and development project in europe and the relocation of a research and development facility and lower licensing and services revenue compared to 2010 operating results for the catalyst business were higher in 2011 compared to 2010 

the following table sets forth the technology segment’s sales and other operating revenues and operating income 

 

 revenues —revenues decreased 8 million or 2 in 2012 compared to 2011 these decreases primarily reflect lower catalyst sales volumes which were responsible for a revenue decrease of 2 in 2012 compared to 2011 price changes in 2012 accounted for a revenue decrease of 3 compared to 2011 in addition the recognition of higher revenues on process licenses issued in prior years in 2012 resulted in an increase of 3 in revenues compared to 2011 

  

revenues were comparable in 2011 and 2010 catalyst sales volumes and prices were essentially the same in both years the recognition of revenue on process licenses issued in prior periods was lower in 2011 and resulted in a 2 decrease in revenues 

operating income —operating income increased 15 million in 2012 compared to 2011 operating results for 2012 included an 18 million charge related to restructuring activities in europe charges of 16 million related to restructuring activities and asset retirement obligations associated with a relocated rd facility and 19 million for the impairment of an rd project in europe were included in our 2011 operating results 

apart from these charges underlying operations of the technology segment’s businesses in 2012 were relatively unchanged compared to 2011 lower catalyst results which stemmed from lower margins and sales volumes were substantially offset by higher revenue recognized from process licenses issued in prior years 

operating income was comparable in 2011 and 2010 in 2011 lower revenue recognized from process licenses issued in prior years and higher research and development costs in 2011 offset the effects of higher operating results for catalysts operating income in both periods reflected the impact of an ongoing slowdown in new polyolefin projects that stemmed from the economic crisis in late 2008 

fourth quarter 2012 versus third quarter 2012 —operating income was 23 million in the fourth quarter compared to 31 million in the third quarter fourth quarter operating results include the 18 million charge related to restructuring activities discussed above after giving consideration to the restructuring charge operating results for the technology segment improved in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter results for the catalyst business improved and higher revenues were recognized in the fourth quarter for licenses issued in prior periods the higher results for our catalyst business reflected an increase in sales volumes that was offset in part by lower average sales prices 

financial condition 

operating investing and financing activities of continuing operations which are discussed below are presented in the following table 

 

 operating activities —cash of 4787 million provided in 2012 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items proceeds received from income tax refunds distributions from our joint ventures insurance settlements and cash provided by the main components of working capital – accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable these increases were offset in part by company contributions to our pension plans and premiums and other fees related to prepayment of debt 

the main components of working capital provided cash of 151 million in 2012 this reflects a decrease in inventories of 441 million partially offset by a 101 million increase in accounts receivable and a 189 decrease in accounts payable a reduction in the high level of our op–americas olefins inventories that were built at the end of 2011 in preparation for a turnaround scheduled for early 2012 at our channelview texas facility and the liquidation of refined products and crude oil inventories following the january 2012 shutdown of our berre refinery were the primary contributors to the 441 million decrease in inventories the increase in 

  

accounts receivable reflects higher sales volumes at the end of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 while the lower accounts payable balance at december 31 2012 reflects lower outstanding crude oil invoices compared to december 31 2011 

cash of 2860 million provided in 2011 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items and higher distributions from our joint ventures partially offset by an increase in cash used by the main components of working capital and payments totaling 1699 million related to company contributions to our pension plans tax payments premiums and other fees related to prepayments of debt and a litigation settlement 

the main components of working capital used cash of 118 million in 2011 the increase in these working capital components during 2011 reflects increases of 89 million and 732 million in accounts receivable and inventories respectively partially offset by a 703 million increase in accounts payable the increases in both accounts receivable and accounts payable reflect increasing prices over the period the increase in inventories reflects higher prices and increased volumes especially in the op—americas business segment as we built inventory in preparation for a major first quarter 2012 turnaround 

cash of 2043 million provided in the combined successor and predecessor periods of 2010 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for noncash items offset by payments for reorganization items claims under the plan of reorganization and certain annual payments relating to sales rebates employee bonuses property taxes and insurance premiums 

in the combined successor and predecessor periods of 2010 the main components of working capital used cash of 456 million the increase in these components of working capital during 2010 reflected a 702 million increase in accounts receivable due to higher average sales prices and higher sales volumes and a 395 million increase in inventory partially offset by a 641 million increase in accounts payable due to the higher costs and volumes of feedstocks and more favorable payment terms 

investing activities —cash used in investing activities in 2012 primarily reflects capital expenditures of 1060 million partially offset by a 48 million decrease in restricted cash 

cash used in investing activities in 2011 primarily reflects capital expenditures of 1050 million including the purchase of a pipeline for 73 million and an increase in restricted cash of 42 million related to the issuance of cash collateralized letters of credit partially offset by proceeds of 71 million from the sale of assets which includes 57 million related to the sale of surplus precious metals 

cash used in investing activities in 2010 included 692 million of capital expenditures partially offset by proceeds of 154 million from the sale of our flavors  fragrance chemicals business in december 2010 

the following table summarizes capital expenditures plan for 2013 and actual capital expenditures for the periods from 2010 through 2012 

 

   

in 2011 and the successor and predecessor periods of 2010 our discontinued operations had capital expenditures of 29 million 25 million and 14 million respectively there were no capital expenditures related to discontinued operations in 2012 the capital expenditures presented in the table above also exclude costs of major periodic maintenance and repair activities including turnarounds and catalyst recharges of 55 million in the predecessor period of 2010 

capital spending projected for 2013 reflects an increase over 2012 levels of approximately 40 this increase includes capital for expansion projects debottlenecks of certain assets to enhance production and the purchase of railcars 

financing activities —financing activities used cash of 2145 million during 2012 financing activities in 2012 reflect proceeds of 3000 million from the issuance of 2000 million of 5 senior notes due 2019 and 1000 million of 575 senior notes due 2024 net proceeds from the notes together with cash on hand were used to finance the repayment in full of the remaining 755 million of our 8 senior notes due 2017 and 1921 million of our 11 senior notes due 2018 respectively and to pay 294 million for associated premiums and fees which are reflected in operating cash flows 

in may 2012 we entered into a fiveyear revolving credit facility and terminated our abl credit facility the revolving credit facility may be used for dollar and euro denominated borrowings and includes a sublimit for up to 700 million of dollar and euro denominated letters of credit the balance of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under the facility may not exceed 2000 million at any given time 

in september 2012 we entered into a threeyear 1000 million us accounts receivable securitization facility that permits the sale of certain eligible trade receivables to participating financial institutions the facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to 200 million 

in aggregate we paid fees related to these financing activities totaling 53 million 

cash dividends of 2415 million were paid during 2012 which include a special dividend of 275 per share paid on december 11 2012 to shareholders of record on november 19 2012 

financing activities used cash of 4955 million during 2011 in 2011 we redeemed an aggregate of 1407 million and €234 million 324 million of our 8 senior notes due 2017 and 1319 million of our 11 senior notes we paid premiums totaling 404 million and bank fees of 7 million in conjunction with these redemptions 

also in 2011 we issued 1000 million of 6 senior notes due 2021 and used the proceeds to pay a portion of a special dividend of 450 per share totaling 2580 million in addition to the special dividend we paid a final 2010 dividend and interim dividends totaling 313 million in june 2011 we paid 15 million of fees related to the amendment of our abl credit facility 

in december 2010 we redeemed 225 million and €375 million 50 million of our 8 senior notes due 2017 and paid premiums of 8 million also in december 2010 we repaid 495 million of the senior term loan facility at par 

we made net payments totaling 398 million in the successor period of 2010 under our european securitization facility which included the entire outstanding balance in october 2010 

as part of our emergence from bankruptcy we received gross proceeds of 2800 million on april 30 2010 in connection with the issuance of shares in a rights offering and paid 86 million of fees including 70 million of fees to equity backstop providers we also received net proceeds of 3242 million at emergence from the issuance of 2250 million and €375 million 497 million of senior secured notes and from proceeds of the senior term loan facility of 495 million and paid related fees of 72 million 

  

proceeds from the rights offering and the senior notes along with borrowings under the senior term loan facility and the amended and restated european securitization facility were used to repay outstanding amounts of 3152 million under our dip financing arrangement and to pay a 195 million exit fee required under the arrangement we also paid fees totaling 92 million in connection with our abl credit facility and amended and restated our european securitization facility predecessor debt classified as liabilities subject to compromise immediately prior to emergence from bankruptcy was discharged pursuant to the plan of reorganization 

apart from the payments reflected above during the 2010 predecessor period we made payments totaling 25 million under other financing arrangements and had a net increase in borrowings of 47 million under the european securitization facility 

for additional information related to these financing activities see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources —as of december 31 2012 we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 2732 million in addition we had total unused availability under our credit facilities of 3348 million at december 31 2012 which included the following 

 

  

  

 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our credit facilities 

in addition to the letters of credit issued under our committed revolving credit facility we also have outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees totaling 83 million at december 31 2012 

at december 31 2012 we had total debt including current maturities of 4400 million 

we have receivables outstanding of €257 million 339 million related to value added tax “vat” in italy in the first quarter 2010 italy implemented a reverse change rule under which nondomestic companies may not collect vat on sales to domestic companies but must submit vat on purchases from domestic companies as a result the balance of vat receivables due from italy which is reflected in other investments and longterm receivables in the consolidated balance sheets has increased since that date we expect to collect all amounts owed to us 

as a result of ceasing operations at our berre refinery in france in january 2012 we expect to make future payments to affected employees and for exit or disposal activities see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this matter 

we may repay or redeem our debt including purchases of our outstanding bonds in the open market using cash on hand cash from operating activities or proceeds from asset divestitures we plan to finance our ongoing working capital capital expenditures debt service and other funding requirements with cash from operations which could be affected by general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory business and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

  

we intend to continue to declare and pay quarterly dividends with the goal of increasing the dividend over time after giving consideration to our cash balances and expected results from operations we believe that our cash on hand cash from operating activities and proceeds from our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due 

contractual and other obligations —the following table summarizes as of december 31 2012 our minimum payments for longterm debt including current maturities shortterm debt and contractual and other obligations for the next five years and thereafter 

 

 total debt —total debt includes our 5 senior notes due 2019 our 6 senior notes due 2021 our 575 senior notes due 2024 our 81 guaranteed notes due 2027 and various other us and nonus loans see note 12 for a discussion of covenant requirements under the credit facilities and indentures and additional information regarding our debt facilities 

interest on total debt —our debt and related party debt agreements contain provisions for the payment of monthly quarterly or semiannual interest at a stated rate of interest over the term of the debt 

pension benefits —we maintain several defined benefit pension plans as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2012 the projected benefit obligation for our pension plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by 1121 million subject to future actuarial gains and losses as well as actual asset earnings we together with our consolidated subsidiaries will be required to fund the 1121 million with interest in future years we contributed 180 million 526 million and 99 million to our pension plans in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively estimates of pension benefit payments net of contributions through 2017 are included in the table above 

other postretirement benefits —we provide other postretirement benefits primarily medical benefits to eligible participants as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements we pay other unfunded postretirement benefits as incurred estimates of other postretirement benefit payments through 2017 are included in the table above 

advances from customers —we are obligated to deliver product primarily at costbased prices in connection with longterm sales agreements under which advances from customers were received in prior years 

  

these advances are treated as deferred revenue and will be amortized to earnings as product is delivered over the remaining terms of the respective contracts which primarily range from 4 to 8 years the unamortized longterm portion of such advances totaled 128 million as of december 31 2012 

other —other primarily consists of accruals for environmental remediation costs obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and anticipated asset retirement obligations see “critical accounting policies” below for a discussion of obligations for environmental remediation costs 

deferred income taxes —the scheduled settlement of the deferred tax liabilities shown in the table is based on the scheduled reversal of the underlying temporary differences actual cash tax payments will vary depending upon future taxable income 

purchase obligations —we are party to various obligations to purchase products and services principally for raw materials utilities and industrial gases these commitments are designed to assure sources of supply and are not expected to be in excess of normal requirements the commitments are segregated into takeorpay contracts and other contracts under the takeorpay contracts we are obligated to make minimum payments whether or not we take the product or service other contracts include contracts that specify minimum quantities however in the event that we do not take the contractual minimum we are only obligated for any resulting economic loss suffered by the vendor the payments shown for the other contracts assume that minimum quantities are purchased for contracts with variable pricing terms the minimum payments reflect the contract price at december 31 2012 

operating leases —we lease various facilities and equipment under noncancelable lease arrangements for various periods see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for related lease disclosures 

related party transactions 

we have related party transactions with certain of our major shareholders and their affiliates and our joint venture partners we believe that such transactions are effected on terms substantially no more or less favorable than those that would have been agreed upon by unrelated parties on an arm’s length basis 

lyondellbasell af had related party transactions with its equity investees and its affiliates as well as a member of its supervisory board see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in addition prior to the emergence date lyondellbasell af had related party transactions with access industries 

critical accounting policies 

management applies those accounting policies that it believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the us see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements our more critical accounting policies include those related to the valuation of inventory longlived assets the valuation of goodwill accruals for longterm employee benefit costs such as pension and other postretirement costs liabilities for anticipated expenditures to comply with environmental regulations and accruals for taxes based on income inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management management periodically updates its estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment 

inventory —lyondellbasell nv adopted the lifo method of accounting for inventory upon implementation of freshstart accounting the price of crude oil and natural gas is subject to many factors including changes in economic conditions the fluctuation in the price of crude oil and natural gas from period to period may result in the recognition of charges to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in periods of falling prices and the reversal of those charges in subsequent interim periods as market prices recover 

  

accordingly our cost of sales and results of operations may be affected by such fluctuations in conjunction with the implementation of freshstart accounting on april 30 2010 the company recorded its inventory which was primarily hydrocarbon derived at fair value 

following the revaluation of our inventory to fair value on april 30 2010 we recorded a net noncash charge of 42 million to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market at december 31 2010 a 71 million charge to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market at june 30 2012 was reversed in the third quarter of 2012 reflecting the recovery of market price as of september 30 2012 no lower of cost or market charges were required in 2011 

longlived assets —with respect to longlived assets which primarily include property plant and equipment and intangible assets key assumptions included the estimates of the asset fair values and useful lives at the emergence date and the recoverability of carrying values of fixed assets and other intangible assets as well as the existence of any obligations associated with the retirement of fixed assets such estimates could be significantly modified andor the carrying values of the assets could be impaired by such factors as new technological developments new chemical industry entrants with significant raw material or other cost advantages uncertainties associated with the european us and other world economies the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries and uncertainties associated with regulatory governmental actions 

when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we evaluate longlived assets including intangible assets for impairment when it is probable that the undiscounted cash flows of a tangible asset or asset group will not be sufficient to recover the carrying amount the asset is written down to its estimated fair value inprocess research and development projects are impaired when abandoned 

during the year ended december 31 2011 and the eight months ended december 31 2010 we recognized impairments of 19 million and 3 million respectively related to certain inprocess research and development projects which were abandoned 

the estimated useful lives of longlived assets range from 3 to 30 years depreciation and amortization of these assets including amortization of capitalized turnaround costs under the straightline method over their estimated useful lives totaled 983 million in 2012 if the useful lives of assets are found to be shorter than originally estimated depreciation and amortization charges would be accelerated over the revised useful life 

goodwill —goodwill of 591 million at december 31 2012 represents the tax effect of the differences between the tax and book bases of the company’s assets and liabilities resulting from the company’s revaluation of those assets and liabilities to fair value in connection with the company’s emergence from bankruptcy and adoption of freshstart accounting lyondellbasell nv evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill of a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable 

we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors assessed for each of the reporting units include but are not limited to changes in longterm commodity prices discount rates competitive environments planned capacity cost factors such as raw material prices and financial performance of the reporting units if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a twostep quantitative test is required 

for 2012 and 2011 our qualitative assessment indicated that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their carrying value accordingly a quantitative twostep goodwill impairment test was not required 

longterm employee benefit costs —the costs to lyondellbasell nv of longterm employee benefits particularly pension and other postretirement medical and life insurance benefits are incurred over long periods 

  

of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is management’s responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent its best estimates of the future effects of those uncertainties it also is management’s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 

the current benefit service costs as well as the existing liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis the discount rate is a current rate related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled lyondellbasell nv’s assumed discount rate is based on yield information for highquality corporate bonds for the purpose of measuring the benefit obligations at december 31 2012 lyondellbasell nv used a weighted average discount rate of 382 for the us plans which reflects the different terms of the related benefit obligations the weighted average discount rate used to measure obligations for nonus plans at december 31 2012 was 363 reflecting market interest rates the discount rates in effect at december 31 2012 will be used to measure net periodic benefit cost during 2013 

the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of other postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits as of december 31 2012 the assumed rate of increase for our us plans was 79 decreasing to 45 in 2027 and thereafter a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate assumption would have no significant effect on either the benefit liability or the net periodic cost due to limits on lyondellbasell nv’s maximum contribution level under the medical plan 

the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption investment returns that are recognized currently in net income represent the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets applied to a marketrelated value of plan assets which for lyondellbasell nv is defined as the market value of assets the expected rate of return on plan assets is a longer term rate and is expected to change less frequently than the current assumed discount rate reflecting longterm market expectations rather than current fluctuations in market conditions 

the weighted average expected longterm rates of return on us and nonus plan assets of 800 and 484 respectively are based on the average level of earnings that our independent pension investment advisor had advised could be expected to be earned over time the expectation is based on an asset allocation that varies by region the asset allocations are summarized in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements the actual returns in 2012 were a gain of 1282 for us plan assets and a gain of 763 for nonus plan assets 

the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets management’s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 

net periodic pension cost recognized each year includes the expected asset earnings rather than the actual earnings or loss along with other gains and losses this unrecognized amount to the extent it cumulatively exceeds 10 of the projected benefit obligation for the respective plan is recognized as additional net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service period of the participants in each plan 

additional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

liabilities for environmental remediation costs —environmental remediation liabilities were recorded at fair value at emergence additional liabilities recorded subsequent to emergence for anticipated expenditures related to investigation and remediation of contaminated sites which include current and former plant sites and other remediation sites are accrued when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the 

  

liability can be reasonably estimated only ongoing operating and monitoring costs the timing of which can be determined with reasonable certainty are discounted to present value future legal costs associated with such matters which generally are not estimable are not included in these liabilities 

as of december 31 2012 lyondellbasell nv’s accrued liability for future environmental remediation costs at current and former plant sites and other remediation sites totaled 126 million the liabilities for individual sites range from less than 1 million to 23 million and remediation expenditures are expected to occur over a number of years and not to be concentrated in any single year in the opinion of management it is reasonably possible that losses in excess of the liabilities recorded for environmental remediation may have been incurred however we cannot estimate any amount or range of such possible additional losses new information about sites new technology or future developments such as involvement in investigations by regulatory agencies could require lyondellbasell nv to reassess potential exposure related to environmental matters see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of environmental remediation matters 

accruals for taxes based on income —the determination of our provision for income taxes and the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities is subject to management’s estimates and judgments due to the complexity of the tax laws and regulations in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of these complex laws and regulations 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 

we recognize future tax benefits to the extent that the realization of these benefits is more likely than not our current provision for income taxes is impacted by the recognition and release of valuation allowances related to net deferred assets in certain nonus jurisdictions further changes to these valuation allowances may impact our future provision for income taxes which will include no tax benefit with respect to losses incurred and no tax expense with respect to income generated in these countries until the respective valuation allowance is eliminated 

we recognize the financial statement benefits with respect to an uncertain income tax position that we have taken or may take on an income tax return when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities for a position that is likely to be sustained the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized 

for further information related to our income taxes see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements of lyondellbasell nv for the year ended december 31 2012

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of lyondellbasell nv’s management of commodity price risk foreign currency exposure and interest rate risk through its use of derivative instruments and hedging activities 

the company’s ability to engage in risk mitigation activities through the use of derivative transactions was limited until april 30 2010 as a result of the voluntary filings in 2009 for relief under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code and the associated perceived credit risk 

  

commodity price risk 

a substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change accordingly product margins and the level of our profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the business cycle we try to protect against such instability through various business strategies these include provisions in sales contracts allowing us to pass on higher raw material costs through timely price increases formula price contracts to transfer or share commodity price risk and increasing the depth and breadth of our product portfolio 

in addition we selectively use commodity swap option and futures contracts with various terms to manage the volatility related to purchases of natural gas and raw materials as well as product sales such contracts are generally limited to durations of one year or less hedge accounting has not been elected for any of our commodity contracts in any of the periods presented market risks created by these derivative instruments and the marktomarket valuations of open positions are monitored by management 

the estimated fair value and notional amounts of our open commodity futures contracts are shown in the table below 

 

 we use value at risk “var” stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes 

var estimates the maximum potential loss in fair market values given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time using specified confidence levels 

using sensitivity analysis and hypothetical changes in market prices ranging from 18 to 31 which represents the one year volatility ranges of the underlying products the effect would have been to increase our net income by less than 1 million the quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account the effects of the underlying operating transactions 

  

foreign exchange risk 

we manufacture and market our products in a number of countries throughout the world and as a result are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates transactions are entered into in part in currencies other than the applicable functional currency 

a significant portion of our reporting entities use the euro as their functional currency our reporting currency is the us dollar the translation gains or losses that result from the process of translating the euro denominated financial statements to us dollars are deferred in aoci until such time as those entities may be liquidated or sold changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro can therefore have a significant impact on comprehensive income we generally do not attempt to minimize or mitigate the foreign currency risks resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of nonus operations into our reporting currency 

some of our operations enter into transactions denominated in other than their functional currency this results in exposure to foreign currency risk for financial instruments including but not limited to third party and intercompany receivables and payables and intercompany loans we maintain risk management control systems intended to monitor foreign currency risk attributable to intercompany and third party outstanding foreign currency balances the control systems involve the centralization of foreign currency exposure management offsetting exposures and estimating the expected impacts of changes in foreign currency rates on our earnings we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of our net currency exchange exposures since june 30 2010 our policy has been to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies to minimize exchange gains and losses arising from changes in exchange rates this position is monitored routinely a 10 fluctuation compared to the us dollar in the underlying currencies would result in an additional impact to earnings of no more than 25 million in any reporting period 

for 2012 2011 and the 2010 successor and predecessor periods other income loss net in the consolidated statements of income reflected a loss of 21 million a loss of 17 million a gain of 18 million and a loss of 258 million respectively in net exchange rate gains and losses the 258 million loss in the 2010 predecessor period was primarily the result of the revaluation of third party debt of certain of our subsidiaries due to changes in the foreign exchange rates in effect during those periods such debt was denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the subsidiaries and was refinanced upon emergence from bankruptcy for forward contracts that economically hedge recognized monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies no hedge accounting is applied changes in the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are reported in the consolidated statements of income and offset the currency exchange results recognized on the assets and liabilities 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to variable rate debt our variable rate debt consists of our 2000 million senior revolving credit facility our 1000 million us receivables securitization facility and our €450 million european receivables securitization facility at december 31 2012 there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

corporate structure and overview 

lyondellbasell industries nv was incorporated under dutch law by deed of incorporation dated october 15 2009 the company was formed to serve as the new parent holding company for certain subsidiaries of lyondellbasell industries af sca lyondellbasell af” from january 2009 through april 2010 lyondellbasell af and 93 of its subsidiaries were debtors in jointly administered bankruptcy cases in us bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york as of april 30 2010 the date of emergence from bankruptcy proceedings lyondellbasell af’s equity interests in its indirect subsidiaries terminated and lyondellbasell industries nv now owns and operates directly and indirectly substantially the same business as lyondellbasell af owned and operated prior to emergence from the bankruptcy cases including subsidiaries of lyondellbasell af that were not involved in the bankruptcy cases 

our company is the successor to the combination in december 2007 of lyondell chemical company “lyondell chemical” and basell af sca “basell” which created one of the world’s largest private petrochemical companies with significant worldwide scale and leading product positions 

we are the world’s third largest independent chemical company based on revenues and an industry leader in many of our product lines we participate globally across the petrochemical value chain with over 50 whollyowned and joint venture facilities our chemicals businesses consist primarily of large processing plants that convert large volumes of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon feedstock into plastic resins and other chemicals our chemical products tend to be basic building blocks for other chemicals and plastics while our plastic products are typically used in large volume applications our customers use our plastics and chemicals to manufacture a wide range of products that people use in their everyday lives including food packaging home furnishings automotive components paints and coatings our houston refinery processes crude oil into fuels such as gasoline diesel and jet fuel 

our financial performance has historically been closely related to the balance between the supply and demand for the products that we produce additional factors that influence our performance include feedstock supply 

  

operational efficiency costs and our differentiated assets and technology during recent years the us cost of natural gas derived raw materials versus the global cost of crude oil derived raw materials has had a significant influence on regional profitability our portfolio includes several differentiated technologies and assets including our propylene oxide technology flexible feedstock olefins plants in the us joint venture olefins and polyolefins plants with access to lowcost feedstock in saudi arabia polypropylene technology and our houston refinery capable of processing heavy highsulfur crude as a producer of large volume commodities we have a strong operational focus and continuously strive to differentiate ourselves through safe reliable and lowcost operations in all our businesses 

segments 

as of december 31 2009 we began reporting our results of operations based on five business segments through which our operations are managed financial information about our business segments can be found in note 21 segment and related information  to the consolidated financial statements our reportable segments include 

 

  

  

  

  

   

the following chart sets out our business segments’ key products 

 

  

  olefins and polyolefins segments generally 

we are a top worldwide producer of olefins including ethylene and propylene we are also a top producer of polyolefins including polyethylene pe and the world’s largest producer of polypropylene pp and pp compounds we manage our olefin and polyolefin business in two reportable segments op—americas and op—eai 

ethylene is the most significant petrochemical in terms of worldwide production volume and is the key building block for pe and a large number of other chemicals plastics and synthetics the production of ethylene results in coproducts such as propylene butadiene and aromatics which include benzene and toluene ethylene and its coproducts are fundamental to many segments of the economy including the production of consumer products packaging housing and automotive components and other durable and nondurable goods 

polyolefins are thermoplastics and comprise approximately twothirds of worldwide thermoplastics demand since their industrial commercialization thermoplastics have found wideranging applications and continue to replace traditional materials such as metal glass paper and wood our products are used in consumer automotive and industrial applications ranging from food and beverage packaging to housewares and construction materials pe is the most widely used thermoplastic measured on a production capacity basis we produce hdpe ldpe lldpe and metallocene linear low density polyethylene pp is the single largest polyolefin product produced worldwide and we produce homopolymer impact copolymer random copolymer and metallocene pp 

  

we produce and market several specialty product lines pp compounds catalloy process resins and pb1 focusing on unique polyolefins and compounds that offer a wide range of performance characteristics typical properties of such specialty polyolefins and compounds include impactstiffness balance scratch resistance soft touch and heat sealability end uses include automotive and industrial products and materials pp compounds are produced from blends of polyolefins and additives and are sold mainly to the automotive and home appliances industries we are the only manufacturer of catalloy process resins which are our proprietary products 

sales of ethylene accounted for approximately 3 of our total revenues in 2011 sales of pe hdpe ldpe and lldpe collectively accounted for 19 of our total revenues in 2011 sales of pp including catalloy  accounted for approximately 15 of our total revenues in 2011 

olefins and polyolefins—americas segment 

overview 

our op—americas segment produces and markets olefins polyolefins aromatics specialty products and ethylene coproducts based on published data we are the largest producer of light olefins ethylene and propylene and pp and the third largest producer of pe in north america in addition we produce specialty products including catalloy resins and other products which are coproducts of our olefins operations in 2011 our op—americas segment generated operating revenues of 103 billion excluding intersegment revenue 

the following table outlines 

 

  

  

  

   

 

  

    

see “description of properties” for the locations where we produce the primary products of our op — americas segment annual processing capacity as of december 31 2011 was calculated by estimating the average number of days in a typical year that a production unit of a plant is expected to operate after allowing for downtime for regular maintenance and multiplying that number by an amount equal to the unit’s optimal daily output based on the design raw material mix because the processing capacity of a production unit is an estimated amount actual production volumes may be more or less than the capacities set forth below capacities shown include 100 of the capacity of joint venture facilities 

sales  marketing  customers 

in 2011 no single external op—americas segment customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues 

we currently produce ethylene at five sites in the us our ethylene production in the us generally is consumed internally as a raw material in the production of polymers and other derivatives or is shipped by pipeline to customers in north america we produce more ethylene than we consume internally with the balance of ethylene production being sold to third parties 

we currently produce propylene at six sites in the us which includes production from the houston refinery’s fluid catalytic cracker coproduct stream we use propylene as a raw material for production of po pp and other derivatives 

we have butadiene and aromatics benzene and toluene production capabilities at two sites in the us we generally sell our butadiene under multiyear contracts we generally use the benzene as a raw material for production of styrene in the us we are a net purchaser of benzene our refining  oxyfuels business uses toluene to blend into gasoline the majority of toluene production that is not consumed internally is sold on a spot basis 

we at times purchase ethylene propylene benzene and butadiene for resale when necessary to satisfy customer demand for these products above our own production levels volumes of ethylene propylene benzene and butadiene purchased for resale can vary significantly from period to period however purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profits 

in the us most of the ethylene and propylene production of our channelview corpus christi and la porte facilities is shipped via a pipeline system which has connections to numerous us gulf coast consumers this pipeline system some of which is owned and some of which is leased extends from corpus christi to mont belvieu to port arthur texas as well as into the lake charles louisiana area in addition exchange agreements with other ethylene and coproducts producers allow access to customers who are not directly connected to this pipeline system ethylene is shipped to our customers by railcar from clinton or morris a pipeline owned and operated by an unrelated party is used to transport ethylene from morris illinois to tuscola illinois some propylene is shipped by ocean going vessel butadiene benzene toluene and other products are distributed by pipeline rail car truck barge or ocean going vessel 

we manufacture pe using a variety of technologies at six sites in the us our pp and pe production is typically sold to an extensive base of established customers under annual contracts or under customary terms and conditions without formal contracts we also have a facility in ohio that produces performance polymer products which include enhanced grades of pe we believe that over a business cycle average selling prices and profit margins for specialty polymers tend to be higher than average selling prices and profit margins for highervolume commodity pes we produce pp at three sites in north america one of which is owned by indelpro our mexican joint venture and one site in south america we also sell pp into our pp compounds business which is managed worldwide by our op—eai segment 

  

the majority of our polyolefin products sold in north america are sold through our sales organization polyolefins primarily are distributed in north america by rail car or truck 

joint venture relationships 

the following table describes our op—americas segment’s significant manufacturing joint venture relationships 

 

  

 indelpro’s output is marketed by the joint venture indelpro’s annual capacity includes 770 million pounds produced from our spherizone process technology we receive equity distributions and revenues from technology licensing and catalyst sales from the joint venture further we believe the geographic diversification provides benefits to our company 

we also have a limited partnership with respect to our laporte texas olefin facility the partnership produces ethylene and propylene our partnership agreement entitles our partner to 500 million pounds of propylene annually and us to all remaining ethylene and propylene production as well as other products produced 

raw materials 

raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost for the production of ethylene and its coproducts the primary raw materials used are heavy liquids and natural gas liquids “ngls” heavy liquids include crude oilbased naphtha and gas oil as well as condensate a very light crude oil resulting from natural gas production collectively referred to as “heavy liquids” ngls include ethane propane and butane the use of heavy liquid raw materials results in the production of a significant amount of coproducts such as propylene butadiene benzene and toluene as well as gasoline blending components while the use of ngls results in the production of a smaller amount of coproducts 

historically facilities using heavy liquids as feedstock have generated higher margins than those using ethane however in recent years ethane has had a cost advantage for use as feedstock in the us based on higher crude oil prices relative to ngls as a result a plant’s flexibility to consume a wide range of raw materials generally will provide an advantage over plants that are restricted in processing capabilities over a number of years we have the capability to process significant quantities of either heavy liquids or ngls we estimate that in the us we can process up to 85 ngls changes in the raw material feedstock will result in variances in production capacities among products we believe our raw material flexibility in the us is a key advantage in the production of ethylene and its coproducts 

we source our heavy liquids requirements worldwide via a mix of contractual and spot arrangements spot market purchases are made in order to maintain raw material flexibility and to take advantage of raw material pricing opportunities we purchase ngl requirements via long term and spot contractual arrangements from a variety of sources a portion of the heavy liquids requirements for ethylene production are also obtained from our refining  oxyfuels segment heavy liquids generally are delivered by ship or barge and ngls are generally delivered via pipeline 

in north america we also purchase large amounts of natural gas to be used primarily as an energy source in our business via marketbased contractual arrangements with a variety of sources 

the principal raw materials used by our polyolefin business are ethylene and propylene during 2011 our north american ethylene and propylene production exceeded the north american raw material requirements of the 

  

polyolefin business of our op—americas segment however not all raw material requirements for ethylene and propylene in this region are sourced internally our mexican joint venture indelpro receives the majority of its chemical grade and refinery grade propylene needs from pemex the state owned oil company of mexico under a longterm contract we purchase ethylene and propylene on a spot and contract basis to meet our internal and external demands as needed 

the raw materials for polyolefins and catalloy process resins are in general commodity chemicals with numerous bulk suppliers and ready availability at competitive prices 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to olefins and polyolefins competition is based on price product quality product delivery reliability of supply product performance and customer service industry consolidation in north america has led to fewer although larger competitors profitability is affected not only by supply and demand for olefins and polyolefins but also by raw material costs and price competition among producers price competition may intensify due to among other things the addition of new capacity in general demand is a function of worldwide economic growth which fluctuates it is not possible to accurately predict the changes in raw material costs market conditions capacity utilization and other factors that will affect industry profitability in the future 

based on published rated production capacities we were the second largest producer of ethylene in north america as of december 31 2011 north american ethylene rated capacity at december 31 2011 was approximately 74 billion pounds per year with approximately 81 of that north american capacity located along the gulf coast at december 31 2011 our ethylene rated capacity in the us was approximately 96   billion pounds per year or approximately 13 of total north american ethylene production capacity 

we compete in north america with other large marketers and producers for sales of ethylene and its coproducts such as dow exxonmobil nova shell ineos chevronphillips tpc group and others 

based on published data with respect to pe we believe that we are the third largest producer in north america as of december 31 2011 with 59 billion pounds per year of capacity or approximately 13 of north american capacity our largest competitors for sales of pe in north america are dow exxonmobil nova chevron phillips ineos and westlake 

based on published data regarding pp capacity we believe that including our proportionate share of the indelpro joint venture we are the largest producer of pp in north america as of december 31 2011 with a proportionate share capacity of 33 billion pounds or approximately 17 of the total north american capacity our largest competitors for sales of pp in north america are exxonmobil total braskem formosa plastics and ineos 

olefins and polyolefins—europe asia international segment 

overview 

our op—eai segment produces and markets olefins ethylene and ethylene coproducts and polyolefins based on published data we are the largest producer of pp and pe in europe and the largest worldwide producer of pp compounds we also produce significant quantities of other specialty products such as catalloy process resins and pb1 our op—eai segment manages our worldwide pp compound business including our facilities in north and south america our worldwide pb1 business and our catalloy process resins produced in europe and asia we have eight joint venture locations in regions with access to low cost feedstocks or access to growing markets in 2011 our op—eai segment generated operating revenues of 151 billion excluding intersegment revenue 

we currently produce ethylene and propylene at three sites in europe and produce butadiene at two sites in europe we also produce each of these products at a joint venture site in the middle east and produce propylene at two other joint venture sites in the middle east and one joint venture site in thailand we produce polyolefins pp andor pe at 19 facilities in the eai region including 10 facilities in europe four facilities in east asia three facilities in the middle east and two facilities in australia our joint ventures own one of the facilities in europe four of the facilities in east asia and three in the middle east 

  

pp compounds consist of specialty products produced from blends of polyolefins and additives and are sold mainly to the automotive and durable goods industries we manufacture pp compounds at 16 facilities worldwide a number of which are the same facilities as the polyolefin facilities described above consisting of four facilities in europe five in east asia one in the middle east three in north america two in south america and one in australia 

we produce catalloy process resins at two sites in the eai region including one in the netherlands and one in italy the process is proprietary technology that is not licensed to third parties and as a result we are the only manufacturer of catalloy process resins 

we produce pb1 at one facility in europe we believe that we are the largest worldwide producer of pb1 a family of flexible strong and durable butenebased polymers a majority of the current pb1 we produce is used in pipe applications and for underfloor heating and thermo sanitary systems pb1 is being developed to target new opportunities in applications such as “easyopen” packaging sealpeel film construction fibers and fabrics compounds adhesives and coatings

sales  marketing  customers 

in 2011 no single external op—eai segment customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues 

we currently produce ethylene at one site in france two sites in germany and one joint venture site in the middle east our ethylene production is generally consumed internally as a raw material in the production of polymers in europe we are essentially balanced in our ethylene supply and demand 

we currently produce propylene at one site in france two sites in germany three joint venture sites in the middle east and one joint venture site in thailand we use propylene as a raw material for production of po and pp in europe we are a net purchaser of propylene 

we currently produce butadiene at one site in france and one site in germany we generally sell our butadiene under multiyear contracts 

we at times purchase ethylene propylene benzene and butadiene for resale when necessary to satisfy customer demand for these products above production levels volumes of ethylene propylene benzene and butadiene purchased for resale can vary significantly from period to period however purchased volumes for resale have not historically had a significant impact on profits 

european ethylene and propylene production is generally either fully integrated with or is transported via pipeline to our pe and pp facilities in europe 

we produce pp at eight sites in europe four sites in east asia two sites in australia and two sites in the middle east all of the sites in east asia and the middle east and one of the sites in europe poland are owned by joint ventures 

we manufacture pe at five sites in europe including one joint venture facility in poland and one joint venture site in the middle east 

with respect to pp and pe our production is typically sold to an extensive base of established customers under annual contracts or under customary terms and conditions without formal contracts we believe that over a business cycle average selling prices and profit margins for specialty polymers tend to be higher than average selling prices and profit margins for highervolume commodity pps 

for the op—eai segment we typically have marketing arrangements with our joint venture partners to sell and market pp and pe outside the country where such a joint venture facility is located 

polyolefins primarily are distributed in europe by rail or truck 

we and our joint ventures manufacture pp compounds at five sites in east asia two of which are owned by 

  

joint ventures four sites in europe three sites in north america one joint venture site in the middle east two sites in south america and one joint venture site in australia we manufacture catalloy process resins at one facility in italy and one facility in the netherlands we also manufacture pb1 at the facility in the netherlands 

our regional sales offices are in various locations including the netherlands hong kong china india and united arab emirates we also operate through a worldwide network of local sales and representative offices in europe asia and africa our joint ventures typically manage their domestic sales and marketing efforts independently and we typically operate as their agentdistributor for all or a portion of their exports 

joint venture relationships 

the following table describes our op—eai segment’s significant manufacturing joint venture relationships 

 

  

  

  

 these joint ventures provide us with additional income streams from cash dividends licensing revenues catalyst sales and marketing fees from selling joint venture products as well as geographical diversification and access to local market skills and expertise we generally license our polyolefin process technologies and supply catalysts to our joint ventures some of our joint ventures source cost advantaged raw materials from their local shareholders 

we market the majority of the pp produced annually by spc and are currently the exclusive marketer for the pp produced by alwaha that is sold outside of saudi arabia we also market all of bop’s pp hpde and ldpe sales outside of poland our polypacific joint venture markets all of its pp compounds production and we market a portion of the pp produced by our asian joint ventures 

raw materials 

raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost for the production of ethylene and its coproducts the primary raw materials used in our european olefin facilities are heavy liquids and for our saudi joint venture facilities ngls including include ethane propane and butane the principal raw materials used by our polyolefin and catalloy process resins businesses are propylene and ethylene in europe we have the capacity to produce 

  

approximately 50 of the propylene requirements of our european pp business and approximately 90 of the ethylene requirements of our european pe business european propylene and ethylene requirements that are not produced internally generally are purchased pursuant to longterm contracts with thirdparty suppliers and are delivered via pipeline prices under these thirdparty contracts are market related and are negotiated monthly and are generally based on published market indicators normally with discounts 

in our wholly owned operations in australia most of our propylene comes from thirdparty refinery grade propylene purchased under longstanding arrangements linked to market prices and is processed at our integrated splitters located on each manufacturing site some of our eai joint ventures receive propylene from their local shareholders under longterm contracts the remaining supply for the joint ventures is purchased from local suppliers under longterm contracts and some spot purchases our saudi joint ventures alwaha sepc and spc produce their own olefins utilizing cost advantaged saudi arabian propane and ethane 

the raw materials for polyolefins are in general commodity chemicals with numerous bulk suppliers and ready availability at competitive prices 

a significant portion of the raw materials for our pp compounds are pp and other polymers including catalloy process resins our pp compounding facilities generally receive their pp and other polymers from one of our wholly owned or joint venture facilities via truck or rail car in addition there are six sites two in europe one in north america one in south america one in asia and one in the middle east that have both pp and pp compounding operations colocated thereby minimizing product handling pb1 raw materials are sourced solely from external supply 

industry dynamics  competition 

our ethylene rated capacity in europe at december 31 2011 was approximately 43 billion pounds per year or approximately 7 of the 59 billion pounds per year of total european ethylene production capacity based on these published rated production capacities we are the sixth largest producer of ethylene in europe in europe key ethylene competitors include ineos total sabic shell basf and exxonmobil 

based on published data regarding pp capacity we believe that we are the largest producer of pp in europe as of december 31 2011 with 52 billion pounds per year of capacity which includes our proportionate share of our joint ventures or approximately 22 of the european capacity for pp our largest competitors for sales of pp are borealis total sabic ineos and braskem 

based on published data regarding pe capacity we believe that we are the largest producer of pe in europe as of december 31 2011 with 50 billion pounds per year of capacity which includes our proportionate share of our joint ventures or approximately 13 of hdpe and ldpe european capacity our largest competitors for sales of pe are borealis exxonmobil dow ineos sabic total polimeri europe and repsol 

we believe based on published data that we are the largest pp compounds producer in the world with 23 billion pounds which includes our proportionate share of joint ventures of installed annual capacity as of december 31 2011 approximately 58 of our pp compounding capacity is in europe 20 is in north america and 22 is in the rest of the world including the capacity of our joint ventures our competitors for sales of pp compounds are borealis exxonmobil king fa mitsubishi mitsui sabic sumitomo chemical co ltd washington penn and many other independent companies 

our 110 million pound pb1 capacity competes with polybutene producers of which mitsui is the largest and other polymers plastomers and elastomers 

intermediates and derivatives segment 

overview 

our id segment produces and markets po and its coproducts and derivatives acetyls and ethylene oxide and 

  

its derivatives po coproducts include sm and c4 chemicals tba most of which is used to make oxyfuels as part of the refining  oxyfuels segment isobutylene and tbhp po derivatives include pg pge and bdo we believe that our proprietary po and acetyls production process technologies provide us with a cost advantaged position for these products and their derivatives in 2011 our id segment generated 64 billion of revenues excluding intersegment revenue 

we produce po through two distinct technologies based on indirect oxidation processes that yield coproducts one process yields tba as the coproduct the other process yields sm as the coproduct the two technologies are mutually exclusive necessitating that a manufacturing facility be dedicated either to potba or to posm isobutylene and tbhp are derivatives of tba mtbe and etbe are derivatives of isobutylene and are gasoline blending components reported in our refining  oxyfuels segment pg pge and bdo are derivatives of po pg collectively refers to monopropylene glycol “mpg” which includes pg meeting us pharmacopeia standards and several grades of dipropylene glycol “dpg” and tripropylene glycol “tpg” 

the following table outlines 

 

  

  

  

   

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 see “description of properties” for the locations where we produce the primary products of our id segment annual processing capacity as of december 31 2011 was calculated by estimating the average number of days in a typical year that a production unit of a plant is expected to operate after allowing for downtime for regular maintenance and multiplying that number by an amount equal to the unit’s optimal daily output based on the design raw material mix because the processing capacity of a production unit is an estimated amount actual production volumes may be more or less than the capacities set forth below except as indicated capacities shown include 100 of the capacity of joint venture facilities 

sales  marketing  customers 

in 2011 no single id segment customer or product accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues 

we estimate based in part on published data that worldwide demand for po was approximately 165 billion pounds in 2011 approximately more than 85 of that volume was consumed in the manufacture of three families of po derivative products polyols glycols and glycol ethers the remainder was consumed in the manufacture of performance products including bdo and its derivatives 

we produce and deliver our po and po coproducts through sales agreements processing agreements and spot sales as well as product exchanges we have a number of multiyear processing or tolling and sales agreements in addition bayer’s ownership interest in the us po joint venture which operates four of the us operating units represents ownership of an inkind portion of the po production bayer also has the right to 50 of the production of one of the facilities in the netherlands our po derivatives are sold through marketbased sales contracts and spot sales 

  

production levels at the posm and potba coproduct facilities are primarily determined by the demand for po and po derivatives as a result production levels of sm and tba and its derivatives isobutylene tbhp mtbe and etbe are based primarily on the demand for po and po derivatives and secondarily on the relative market demand for the coproducts and the operational flexibility of our facilities in meeting this demand mtbe and etbe are reported in our refining  oxyfuels segment 

based on published data worldwide demand for sm in 2011 is estimated to have been approximately 58   billion pounds we sell most of our sm production into the north american and european merchant markets and to asian and south american export markets through longterm sales contracts and processing agreements 

we purchase sm for resale when necessary to satisfy customer demand above production levels volumes of sm purchases made for resale can vary significantly from period to period however purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profits 

our id segment converts most of its tba which is produced as a coproduct to the po process to isobutylene and sells some of the tba into the market over half of the isobutylene from the id segment is reacted with methanol or ethanol to produce mtbe and etbe which is marketed by the refining  oxyfuels segment the remaining isobutylene is sold as high purity and purity grade isobutylene by the id segment 

sales of our po its coproducts and its derivatives are made by us nihon oxirane a joint venture of which we own 40 and their affiliates directly and through distributors and independent agents in the americas europe the middle east africa and the asia pacific region we have centralized certain sales and order fulfillment functions in regional customer service centers in houston texas rotterdam the netherlands and hong kong china po pg and sm are transported by barge ocean going vessel pipeline rail car and tank truck bdo is primarily transported by tank truck and rail car 

acetic acid and vam are manufactured at a facility in la porte texas and are consumed internally sold worldwide generally under multiyear contracts and sold on a spot basis acetic acid and vam are shipped by barge ocean going vessel pipeline rail car and tank truck we have bulk storage arrangements in europe and south america to serve our customers’ requirements in those regions sales are made through a direct sales force agents and distributors 

we estimate based on published data that worldwide demand in 2011 for acetic acid and vam was 233   billion pounds and 114 billion pounds respectively 

methanol is produced at a la porte texas facility owned by la porte methanol company our 85 owned joint venture with linde each party to the joint venture receives its respective share of the methanol production our acetyls business uses the methanol as a raw material for acetic acid and also sells the methanol under annual contracts and on a spot basis to large us customers the product is shipped by barge and pipeline 

ethylene oxide “eo” or eo equivalents and eo’s primary derivative ethylene glycol “eg” are produced at a wholly owned facility in bayport texas the bayport facility also produces other derivatives of eo principally glycol ethers 

eo and eg typically are sold under multiyear contracts with marketbased pricing glycol ethers and ethanolamines are sold primarily into the solvent and distributor markets at market prices eo is shipped by rail car and its derivatives are shipped by rail car truck isotank or oceangoing vessel 

the vast majority of the ethylene derivative products are sold in north america and asia primarily through our sales organizations 

  

joint venture relationships 

the following table describes our id segment’s significant manufacturing joint venture relationships 

 

  

  

  

 bayer’s ownership interest in the us po joint venture represents its offtake of 15 billion pounds of the joint venture’s po production we take inkind the remaining po production and all coproduct sm and tba production lyondell chemical and bayer have a separate joint venture the po technology joint venture through which bayer was granted a nonexclusive and nontransferable right to use certain of our proprietary po technology in the us po joint venture under the terms of operating and logistics agreements we operate the us po joint venture plants and arrange and coordinate the logistics of po delivery from the plants we do not share marketing or product sales with bayer under the us po joint venture 

lyondell chemical and bayer also have a 5050 joint venture the european po joint venture for the ownership of the maasvlakte posm plant near rotterdam the netherlands each party takes inkind 50 of the po and sm production of the european po joint venture 

lyondell chemical’s posm ii plant at the channelview texas complex is a joint venture among lyondell chemical styrolution and nova lyondell chemical owns a majority interest in the joint venture and is the operator of the plant as of december 31 2011 700 million pounds of sm capacity was committed to styrolution and nova under processing arrangements 

in addition to the nihon oxirane joint venture shown in the table above we participate in marketing most of the po capacity from a 440 million pound facility in rabigh saudi arabia owned by sumitomo and saudi aramco through noc asia co ltd in which we have a 40 equity interest 

we jointly market all of the po manufactured by the ningbo zrcc joint venture 

we also have a multiyear processing agreement entered into by lyondell chemical and shiny whereby we provide the raw materials used to produce pge at shiny’s pge plant in tainan taiwan 

raw materials 

the primary raw materials used for the production of po and its coproducts and derivatives are propylene 

  

isobutane mixed butane ethylene and benzene the market prices of these raw materials historically have been related to the price of crude oil ngls and natural gas as well as market conditions including supply of and demand for the raw materials these raw materials are received in bulk quantities via pipeline or ocean going vessels 

in the us we obtain a large portion of our propylene benzene and ethylene raw materials needed for the production of po and its coproducts and derivatives internally from our crackers raw materials for the nonus production of po and its coproducts and derivatives primarily are obtained from unrelated parties we consume a significant portion of our internallyproduced po in the production of po derivatives 

we consume large volumes of mixed butane for the production of po and its coproducts and derivatives we have invested in facilities or entered into processing agreements with unrelated parties to convert the widely available commodity normal butane to isobutane we also are a large consumer of oxygen for our potba plants 

the cost of raw materials generally is the largest component of total production cost for po and its coproducts and derivatives generally the raw material requirements for these businesses are purchased at marketbased prices from numerous suppliers in the us and europe with which we have established contractual relationships as well as in the spot market the raw materials for these businesses are in general commodity chemicals with ready availability at competitive prices historically raw material availability has not been an issue however in order to enhance reliability and competitiveness of prices and rates for supplies of raw materials industrial gas and other utilities we have longterm agreements and other arrangements for a substantial portion of our production requirements 

the primary raw materials required for the production of acetic acid are carbon monoxide and methanol we purchase the carbon monoxide from linde pursuant to a longterm contract under which pricing is based primarily on cost of production la porte methanol company our 85owned joint venture supplies all of the methanol requirements for acetyls production natural gas is the primary raw material required for the production of methanol 

in addition to ethylene acetic acid is a primary raw material for the production of vam for the production of vam we obtain our entire requirements for acetic acid and ethylene from our internal production in 2011 we used a large percentage of our acetic acid production to produce vam 

industry dynamics  competition 

with respect to po its coproducts and derivatives competition is based on a variety of factors including product quality and price reliability of supply technical support customer service and potential substitute materials profitability is affected by the worldwide level of demand along with price competition which may intensify due to among other things new industry capacity however demand is also influenced by worldwide economic growth which fluctuates the po demand growth rate also could be impacted by further development of alternative biobased po derivatives it is not possible to predict accurately the changes in raw material costs market conditions and other factors that will affect industry profitability in the future 

based on published data regarding po capacity we believe that including our share of nihon oxirane ningbo zrcc and the european po joint venture we are the second largest producer of po worldwide with approximately 13 of the total worldwide capacity for po our major worldwide competitors for sales of po and its derivatives are dow and shell 

based on published data regarding sm capacity we believe that we are one of the largest producers of sm worldwide with approximately 5 of the total worldwide capacity for sm as of december 31 2011 we compete worldwide for sales of sm with many marketers and producers among which are styrolution cosmar americas styrenics and shell 

we believe that we are the sixth and eighth largest producer of acetic acid and vam respectively each with approximately 3 and 5 of the total worldwide capacity as of december 31 2011 our primary competitors include celanese and bp for acetic acid and celanese dow and dupont for vam 

  

refining  oxyfuels segment 

overview 

our refining  oxyfuels segment refines heavy highsulfur crude oil in the us gulf coast and produces gasoline blending components at several of our olefin and po sites in 2011 our refining  oxyfuels segment generated operating revenues of 188 billion excluding intersegment revenue 

our houston refinery which is located on the houston ship channel in houston texas has a heavy highsulfur crude oil processing capacity of approximately 268000 barrels per day on a calendar day basis normal operating basis or approximately 292000 barrels per day on a stream day basis maximum achievable over a 24 hour period the houston refinery has a nelson complexity index of 121 the houston refinery is a full conversion refinery designed to refine heavy highsulfur crude oil this crude oil is more viscous and dense than traditional crude oil and contains higher concentrations of sulfur and heavy metals making it more difficult to refine into gasoline and other highvalue fuel products however this crude oil has historically been less costly to purchase than light lowsulfur crude oil processing heavy highsulfur crude oil in significant quantities requires a refinery with extensive coking catalytic cracking hydrotreating and desulfurization capabilities ie a “complex refinery” the houston refinery’s refined fuel products include gasoline including blendstocks for oxygenate blending jet fuel and ultra low sulfur diesel the houston refinery’s products also include heating oil lube oils industrial lubricants white oils and process oils carbon black oil refinerygrade propylene petrochemical raw materials sulfur residual fuel and petroleum coke 

the refining  oxyfuels segment also includes gasoline blending components such as mtbe etbe and alkylate mtbe and etbe are produced as coproducts of the po and olefin production process at four sites in the united states france and the netherlands we currently have three sites that can produce either mtbe or etbe with a combined capacity to produce 59000 barrels per day of mtbe or etbe the company’s total capacity for mtbe or etbe production is 75000 barrels per day alkylate is produced at one facility in texas 

on january 4 2012 refinery operations were suspended at our berre refinery in france the suspension of operations was in accordance with an agreement executed in the fourth quarter of 2011 by our french entities and union representatives addressing the procedures by which suspension of refinery operations and works council consultations would be governed consultations with the relevant works councils are in progress additional information about the suspension of operations can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

the following table outlines 

 

  

  

   

see “description of properties” for the locations where we produce the primary products of our refining  oxyfuels segment 

 

  

  

 sales  marketing  customers 

in 2011 no single refining  oxyfuels segment customer or product accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues 

in the us we market and sell gasoline including blendstocks for oxygenate blending jet fuel heating oil ultra low sulfur diesel fuel lube oils coke and sulfur produced at the houston refinery these products are sold in large commodity markets the houston refinery evaluates and determines its optimal product output mix based on market prices and conditions as a result we are subject to various risks associated with selling commodity products 

gasoline sales accounted for 7 of our total revenues in 2011 the houston refinery’s products primarily are sold in bulk on the us gulf coast to other refiners marketers distributors and wholesalers at marketrelated prices diesel fuel is produced to meet ultra low sulfur specifications for the onroad transportation market most of the houston refinery’s products are sold under contracts with a term of one year or less or are sold in the spot market the houston refinery’s products generally are transported to customers via pipelines and terminals owned and operated by other parties products also are transported via rail car barge truck and ocean going vessel in addition to sales of refined products produced by the houston refinery we also sell refined products purchased or received on exchange from other parties the exchange arrangements help optimize refinery supply operations and lower transportation costs to meet market demands we also from time to time purchase refined products manufactured by others for resale to our customers however purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profitability 

mtbe and etbe are derivatives of tba which is a coproduct of the po produced by our id segment as described production levels of the tba derivatives mtbe and etbe depend primarily on the demand for po and po derivatives and secondarily on the relative market demand for mtbe and etbe and the operational flexibility of our multiple production facilities in meeting this demand separately mtbe and alkylate are also produced as derivatives of the ethylene coproducts produced by our op—americas segment when necessary we purchase mtbe for resale to satisfy customer demand for mtbe above our production levels volumes of mtbe purchased for resale can vary significantly from period to period however purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profitability 

we sell our mtbe and etbe production under marketbased sales agreements and in the spot market we blend our alkylate into gasoline and also sell alkylate under shortterm contracts and in the spot market 

  

substantially all refiners and blenders have discontinued the use of mtbe in the us partly as a result of governmental initiatives to increase use of bioethanol in gasoline and to reduce or effectively ban the use of mtbe however mtbeetbe demand for gasoline blending remains strong within most of the remaining worldwide market accordingly we market mtbe and etbe produced in the us for use outside of the us our mtbeetbe plants generally have the flexibility to produce either mtbe or etbe to accommodate market needs 

japan has opted to use etbe as a means of meeting its carbon dioxide reduction commitments under the kyoto protocol and we source a significant portion of japan’s biofuels needs 

sales of our mtbe etbe and alkylate are made by our marketing and sales personnel and through distributors and independent agents in the americas europe the middle east africa and the asia pacific region we have centralized certain sales and order fulfillment functions in regional customer service centers in houston texas rotterdam the netherlands and hong kong china we also have longterm contracts for distribution and logistics to ensure reliable and efficient supply to our customers mtbe etbe and alkylate are transported by barge ocean going vessel and tank truck 

raw materials 

we purchase the crude oil used as a raw material for the houston refinery on the open market on a spot basis and under a number of supply agreements with regional producers 

we purchase our ethanol requirements for the production of etbe from regional producers and importers in europe at marketrelated prices additionally we have entered into a supply contract with a brazilian ethanol producer to supply a significant portion of the ethanol used for the manufacture of etbe at our channelview facility for further discussion regarding the raw materials requirements for the production of mtbe etbe and alkylate see “—intermediates and derivatives segment—raw materials” 

industry dynamics  competition 

the markets for fuel products tend to be volatile as well as cyclical as a result of changing global economic conditions and prices for crude oil and refined product prices crude oil prices are impacted by worldwide economic conditions and political events the economics of exploration and production refined products demand and currency fluctuations prices and demand for fuel products are influenced by seasonal and shortterm factors such as weather and driving patterns as well as by longer term issues such as the economy energy conservation and alternative fuels industry fuel products supply is dependent on shortterm industry operating capabilities and on longterm refining capacity 

with a throughput capacity of approximately 268000 barrels per day on a calendar day basis we believe that our houston refinery is among north america’s largest full conversion refineries capable of processing significant quantities of heavy highsulfur crude oil 

in north america we compete for the purchase of heavy highsulfur crude oil based on price and quality we compete in gasoline and distillate markets as a bulk supplier of fungible products satisfying industry and government specifications competition is based on price and location our refining competitors are major integrated oil companies refineries owned or controlled by foreign governments and independent domestic refiners based on published data as of january 2012 there were 148 operable crude oil refineries in the us and total us refinery capacity was approximately 177 million barrels per day 

during 2011 the houston refinery processed an average of approximately 263000 barrels per day of crude oil representing approximately 15 of all us crude processing capacity 

a crack spread is a benchmark indication of refining margins based on the processing of a specific type of crude oil into an assumed selection of refined products the houston refinery generally tracks the maya 211 crack 

  

spread which represents the difference between the first month futures price of two barrels of maya crude oil as set by pemex and one barrel each of us gulf coast 87 octane conventional gasoline and us gulf coast no 2 heating oil highsulfur diesel while these benchmark refining spreads are generally indicative of the level of profitability at the houston refinery there are many other factors specific to each refinery that influence operating results 

we believe that we are the largest producer of mtbeetbe worldwide we compete for sales of mtbe and etbe with independent mtbe producers worldwide and independent etbe producers mainly in europe the most significant mtbe competitor is sabic and the most significant etbe competitors are repsol total neste and braskem mtbe and etbe face competition from products such as ethanol and other octane components we compete with other refiners and olefin manufacturers for sales of alkylate that we do not internally blend into gasoline 

technology segment 

overview 

our technology segment develops and licenses chemical polyolefin and other process technologies and provides associated engineering and other services our technology segment further develops manufactures and sells polyolefin catalysts we market our process technologies and our polyolefin catalysts to external customers and also use them in our own manufacturing operations in 2011 our technology segment generated operating revenues of 376 million excluding intersegment revenue 

our polyolefin process licenses are structured to provide a standard core technology with individual customer needs met by adding customized modules that provide the required capabilities to produce the defined production grade slate and plant capacity for licenses involving proven technologies we typically receive the majority of our license fees in cash at or before the date of customer acceptance rather than ongoing royalties for these licenses we generally recognize revenue upon delivery of the process design package and the related license each license agreement includes longterm confidentiality provisions to protect the technology in addition to the basic license agreement a range of services can also be provided including project assistance training startup assistance of the plant and supply of resins from our production for premarketing by the licensee we may also offer marketing and sales services in addition licensees generally continue to purchase polyolefin catalysts that are consumed in the production process generally under longterm catalyst supply agreements with us 

process technology licensing 

we are a leading licensor of polyolefin process technologies 

our pp licensing portfolio includes our spheripol and spherizone process technologies as well as metocene technology 

our pe process licensing portfolio comprises the lupotech t high pressure tubular process for producing ldpe the lupotech a autoclave process mainly for producing ethylene vinyl acetate eva copolymers hostalen slurry process for producing multimodal hdpe and spherilene gas phase process for producing fulldensity range of lldpe to hdpe processes 

in addition we license a selective portfolio of chemical process technologies in the fields of olefin recovery olefin conversion aromatics extraction and acetyls 

since 2000 we have sold licenses representing approximately 27 million tons of polyolefin capacity which represents about 40 of worldwide installed capacity in 2011 we entered into licensing agreements representing approximately one million tons of polyolefin capacity 

our technology segment also provides technology services to our licensees such services include safety reviews training and startup assistance engineering services for process and product improvements and manufacturing troubleshooting 

  

pp process technology 

we license several pp process technologies including spheripol  spherizone and metocene  

our spheripol technology produces homopolymers and random copolymers in a single stage and impact copolymers in a multistage process we believe that the spheripol process is the most widely used pp production process in the world 

the spherizone process was commercialized in 2002 and introduced for licensing in 2004 it is able to produce higher quality pp novel ppbased polyolefinic resins and a wider product grade range than other processes at similar operating cost the spherizone process introduces a single reactor concept in which bimodality is created within one single reactor operating at different conditions between the different zones inside the reactor the final product is a result of an intimate mixing of the different property determining phases at a “macro molecular” level 

metocene pp technology was introduced for licensing in 2006 this addon technology for the production of specialty pp products is based on using singlesite catalyst systems metocene technology can be adapted to virtually any pp process and its versatility expands the end use product range of conventional pp in 2009 polymirae became the first licensee to commence commercial production of metocene  

pe processes technology 

the different families of pe hdpe ldpe and lldpe require specialized process technologies for production which are available through our broad pe process licensing portfolio the portfolio includes lupotech  spherilene and hostalen process technologies 

lupotech t is a high pressure tubular reactor process for the production of ldpe this high pressure technology does not use a catalyst system typical for low pressure processes but rather peroxide initiators to polymerize ethylene and optionally vam for evacopolymers by adjusting the temperature profile along the reactor and adding different peroxide mixtures process conditions are modified to produce the desired products the process produces the entire melt flow ratio and density range with competitive investment costs and low utilities and raw material demand 

lupotech a is a high pressure autoclave process using peroxide mixture for polymerization and is mainly utilized for specialty ldpe and for the production of eva copolymers with high vam content 

spherilene is a flexible gasphase process for the production of the entire density range of pe products from lldpe and mdpe to hdpe the flexibility of this technology which is demonstrated by a broad portfolio of grades enables licensees to effectively manage the continuously dynamic pe markets at low investments costs and very low operating costs 

hostalen is a lowpressure slurry process technology for the production of highperformance multimodal hdpe grades this is desirable because a different product structure can be produced in each stage of the polymerization process yielding products that are tailored for demanding processing requirements and sophisticated end use applications such as film blow molding and pipe applications 

chemical process technologies 

we also offer for licensing a select number of chemical processes including the group of trans4m processes aromatics extractions glacido and vacido technology 

the trans4m portfolio of process technologies offers tailored solutions for c4 and higher olefin recovery and conversion these processes include separation purification and skeletal isomerization of the c4 and c5 olefin streams for the selective conversion of lowvalue mixed olefin streams from crackers to isobutylene isoamylenes 

  

butadiene isoprene piperylene and dicyclopentadiene dcpd this group of processes is complemented by aromatics extractions technology which enables us to offer a comprehensive portfolio of processes to upgrade all olefinic streams from steam crackers to higher value products 

glacido is a process technology for manufacturing of acetic acid by carbonylation of methanol it utilizes a rhodiumbased homogeneous catalyst system vacido is a fixedbed tubular process for the production of highquality vam from acetic acid and ethylene it utilizes a proprietary heterogeneous catalyst system 

superflex technology produces propylene and ethylene and is based on a fluidized catalytic reactor the process technology is used for cracking less refined feedstock such as coker or fluid catalytic cracking unit light gasoline as well as mixed c4 to c9 streams 

polyolefin catalysts 

under the avant brand we are a leading manufacturer and supplier of polyolefin catalysts as a large polyolefin producer approximately 30 of catalyst sales are intercompany polyolefin catalysts are packaged and shipped via road sea or air to our customers 

we produce catalysts at two facilities in germany one facility in italy and one facility in the us our polyolefin catalysts which are consumed during the polyolefin production process and define the processing and mechanical properties of polyolefins provide enhanced performance for our process technologies and are being developed to enhance performance when used in thirdparty process technologies we also supply catalysts for producing sophisticated pes 

customers using polyolefin catalysts must make continual purchases because they are consumed during the polyolefin production process new licensees often elect to enter into longterm catalyst supply agreements 

sales  marketing 

in 2011 no single technology segment customer or product accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues we market our process technologies and catalysts to external customers and also use them for our own polyolefin manufacturing operations we have a marketing and sales force dedicated to the technology segment including catalyst sales and customer technical support for licensees 

industry dynamics  competition 

we believe that competition in the polyolefin process licensing industry is based on the quality and efficiency of the process technology product performance and product application complemented by customer service and technical support since the formation of basell in 2000 through december 31 2011 we have sold licenses representing approximately 27 million tons of capacity based on its six process technologies to polyolefin manufacturers we estimate that approximately 40 of pp and 30 of pe worldwide licensed capacity from 2003 through 2011 use our technologies as of december 31 2011 we estimate that over 200 polyolefin production lines use our licensed process technologies our major competitors in pp technologies licensing are dow chemical ineos novolene technology holdings and mitsui chemicals our major competitors in pe technologies licensing are chevronphillips ineos mitsui chemicals and univation technologies 

we are one of the world’s largest manufacturers and suppliers of pp catalysts we also supply catalysts for producing pes our major competitors in the worldwide catalyst business are dow chemical basf mitsui chemicals toho catalyst and wr grace 

research and development 

our research and development activities are designed to improve our existing products and discover and commercialize new materials catalysts and processes these activities focus on product and application development process development catalyst development and fundamental polyolefin focused research 

  

we have three research and development facilities each with a specific focus our facility in frankfurt germany focuses on pe and metallocene catalysts our facility in ferrara italy focuses on pp pb1 catalloy process resins and zieglernatta catalysts our facility in cincinnati ohio focuses on polyolefin product and application development in north america 

our financial performance and market position depend in substantial part on our ability to improve our existing products and discover and commercialize new materials catalysts and processes our research and development is organized by core competence communities that manage and provide resources for projects intellectual property and catalyst manufacturing these include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we have core research and development projects that focus on initiatives in line with our strategic direction these projects are closely aligned with our businesses and customers with a goal of commercialization of identified opportunities core projects currently include research and development in areas such as 

 

  

  

  

 as of december 31 2011 approximately 827 of our employees are directly engaged in research and development activities 

in addition to our research and development activities we provide technical support to our customers our technical support centers are in bayreuth germany cincinnati ohio geelong australia lansing michigan and tarragona spain 

in 2011 2010 and 2009 our research and development expenditures were 196 million 154 million and 145 million respectively a portion of these expenses are related to technical support and customer service and are primarily allocated to the other business segments 

  

general 




 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 

economic downturns and disruptions in financial markets can adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our results of operations can be materially affected by adverse conditions in the financial markets and depressed economic conditions generally economic downturns in the businesses and geographic areas in which we sell our products substantially reduce demand for our products and result in decreased sales volumes recessionary environments adversely affect our business because demand for our products is reduced particularly from our customers in industrial markets generally and the automotive and housing industries specifically 

deteriorating sovereign debt conditions in europe and the related euro crisis could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

the recent escalation of the european sovereign debt crisis has negatively impacted the capital markets in europe and caused the value of the euro to deteriorate these conditions have resulted in reduced consumer confidence and spending in many countries in europe particularly southern europe a significant portion of our revenues and earnings are derived from our business in europe including southern europe in addition most of our european transactions and assets including cash reserves and receivables are denominated in euros 

if the european sovereign debt crisis continues or further deteriorates there will likely be a continued negative effect on our european business as well as the businesses of our european customers suppliers and partners in addition if the crisis ultimately leads to a significant devaluation of the euro the value of our financial assets that are denominated in euros would be significantly reduced when translated to us dollars for financial reporting purposes any of these conditions could ultimately harm our overall business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

the cyclicality and volatility of the industries in which we participate may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 

our business operations are subject to the cyclical and volatile nature of the supplydemand balance in the chemical and refining industries our future operating results are expected to continue to be affected by this cyclicality and volatility the chemical and refining industries historically have experienced alternating periods of capacity shortages causing prices and profit margins to increase followed by periods of excess capacity resulting in oversupply declining capacity utilization rates and declining prices and profit margins 

in addition to changes in the supply and demand for products changes in energy prices and other worldwide economic conditions can cause volatility these factors result in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over business cycles 

in addition new capacity additions in asia the middle east and north america may lead to periods of oversupply and lower profitability the timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions is uncertain and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time as a consequence we are unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of future industry cycles or their effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we can give no assurances as to any predictions we may make with respect to the timing extent or duration of future industry cycles 

costs and limitations on supply of raw materials and energy may result in increased operating expenses 

the costs of raw materials and energy represent a substantial portion of our operating expenses energy costs generally follow price trends of crude oil and natural gas these price trends may be highly volatile and cyclical in the past raw material and energy costs have experienced significant fluctuations that adversely affected our business segments’ results of operations for example we continue to benefit from the favorable ratio of us natural gas prices to crude oil prices however if the price of crude oil decreases relative to us natural gas prices this may have a negative result on our results of operations moreover fluctuations in currency exchange rates can add to this volatility 

we are not always able to pass raw material and energy cost increases on to our customers when we do have the ability to pass on the cost increases we are not always able to do so quickly enough to avoid adverse impacts on our results of operations 

cost increases for raw materials also may increase working capital needs which could reduce our liquidity and cash flow even if we increase our sales prices to reflect rising raw material and energy costs demand for products may decrease as customers reduce their consumption or use substitute products which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition producers in natural gas costadvantaged regions such as the middle east and north america benefit from the lower prices of natural gas and ngls competition from producers in these regions may cause us to reduce exports from europe and elsewhere any such reductions may increase competition for product sales within europe and other markets which can result in lower margins in those regions additionally there are a limited number of suppliers for some of our raw materials and utilities and in some cases the supplies are specific to the particular geographic region in which a facility is located 

it is also common in the chemical and refining industries for a facility to have a sole dedicated source for its utilities such as steam electricity and gas having a sole or limited number of suppliers may limit our negotiating power particularly in the case of rising raw material costs any new supply agreements we enter into may not have terms as favorable as those contained in our current supply agreements 

if our raw material or utility supplies were disrupted our businesses may incur increased costs to procure alternative supplies or incur excessive downtime which would have a direct negative impact on plant operations for example hurricanes have in the past negatively affected crude oil and natural gas supplies as well as supplies of other raw materials utilities such as electricity and steam and industrial gases contributing to increases in operating costs and in some cases disrupting production and causing lost profit opportunities in addition hurricanerelated disruption of vessel barge rail truck and pipeline traffic in the us gulf coast area would negatively affect shipments of raw materials and product 

  

with increased volatility in raw material costs our suppliers could impose more onerous terms on us resulting in shorter payment cycles and increasing our working capital requirements 

we sell products in highly competitive global markets and face significant price pressures 

we sell our products in highly competitive global markets due to the commodity nature of many of our products competition in these markets is based primarily on price and to a lesser extent on product performance product quality product deliverability reliability of supply and customer service generally we are not able to protect our market position for these products by product differentiation and may not be able to pass on cost increases to our customers 

in addition we face increased competition from companies that may have greater financial resources and different cost structures or strategic goals than us these include large integrated oil companies some of which also have chemical businesses governmentowned businesses and companies that receive subsidies or other government incentives to produce certain products in a specified geographic region increased competition from these companies especially in our olefin and refining businesses could limit our ability to increase product sales prices in response to raw material and other cost increases or could cause us to reduce product sales prices to compete effectively which could reduce our profitability competitors that have greater financial resources than us may be able to invest significant capital into their businesses including expenditures for research and development 

in addition specialty products we produce may become commoditized over time increased competition could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 

our ability to source raw materials including crude oil may be adversely affected by political instability civil disturbances or other governmental actions 

we obtain a substantial portion of our principal raw materials from sources in north africa the middle east and south america that may be less politically stable than other areas in which we conduct business such as europe or the us political instability civil disturbances and actions by governments in these areas are likely to substantially increase the price and decrease the supply of feedstocks necessary for our operations which will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

recently increased incidents of civil unrest including demonstrations which have been marked by violence have occurred in some countries in north africa and the middle east some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest political instability and civil unrest could continue to spread in the region and involve other areas such unrest if it continues to spread or grow in intensity could lead to civil wars regional conflict or regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to countries in which we conduct substantial business such as europe the us or their respective allies 

interruptions of operations at our facilities may result in liabilities or lower operating results 

we own and operate largescale facilities our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our various production facilities and the ability to complete construction and maintenance projects on schedule interruptions at our facilities may materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or our business as a whole during and after the period of such operational difficulties in the past we had to shut down plants on the us gulf coast including the temporary shutdown of our houston refinery as a result of hurricanes striking the texas coast 

in addition because the houston refinery is our only north american refining operation an outage at the refinery could have a particularly negative impact on our operating results unlike our chemical and polymer production facilities which may have sufficient excess capacity to mitigate the negative impact of lost production at other facilities we do not have the ability to increase refining production elsewhere in the us 

  

although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions our operations are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and refining and the related storage and transportation of raw materials products and wastes these potential hazards include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities 

our operations are subject to risks inherent in chemical and refining businesses and we could be subject to liabilities for which we are not fully insured or that are not otherwise mitigated 

we maintain property business interruption product general liability casualty and other types of insurance including pollution and legal liability that we believe are in accordance with customary industry practices however we are not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to our business including losses resulting from natural disasters war risks or terrorist acts changes in insurance market conditions have caused and may in the future cause premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies to increase substantially and in some instances for certain insurance to become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured we might not be able to finance the amount of the uninsured liability on terms acceptable to us or at all and might be obligated to divert a significant portion of our cash flow from normal business operations 

further because a part of our business involves licensing polyolefin process technology our licensees are exposed to similar risks involved in the manufacture and marketing of polyolefins hazardous incidents involving our licensees if they do result or are perceived to result from use of our technologies may harm our reputation 

  

threaten our relationships with other licensees andor lead to customer attrition and financial losses our policy of covering these risks through contractual limitations of liability and indemnities and through insurance may not always be effective as a result our financial condition and results of operation would be adversely affected and other companies with competing technologies may have the opportunity to secure a competitive advantage 

certain activities related to a former project raise compliance issues under us law 

we have identified an agreement related to a former project in kazakhstan under which a payment was made that raises compliance concerns under the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” we have engaged outside counsel to investigate these activities under the oversight of the audit committee of the supervisory board and to evaluate internal controls and compliance policies and procedures we made a voluntary disclosure of these matters to the us department of justice and are cooperating fully with that agency we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters at this time since our investigations are ongoing in this respect we may not have conducted business in compliance with the fcpa and may not have had policies and procedures in place adequate to ensure compliance therefore we cannot reasonably estimate a range of liability for any potential penalty resulting from these matters violations of these laws could result in criminal and civil liabilities and other forms of penalties or sanctions that could be material to us 

our operations could be adversely affected by labor relations 

the vast majority of our employees located in europe and south america are represented by labor unions and works councils approximately 900 of our employees located in north america are represented by labor unions of the represented north american employees approximately 50 include our employees that are subject to a collective bargaining agreement between houston refining lp and the united steelworkers union which agreement will expire on january 31 2015 

our operations have been in the past and may be in the future significantly and adversely affected by strikes work stoppages and other labor disputes 

we cannot predict with certainty the extent of future costs under environmental health and safety and other laws and regulations and cannot guarantee they will not be material 

we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture handle or own in addition because our products are components of a variety of other enduse products we along with other members of the chemical industry are subject to potential claims related to those enduse products any substantial increase in the success of these types of claims could negatively affect our operating results 

we together with the industries in which we operate are subject to extensive national regional state and local environmental laws regulations directives rules and ordinances concerning 

 

  

  

 many of these laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations in addition some of these laws and regulations require us to meet specific financial responsibility requirements any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

although we have compliance programs and other processes intended to ensure compliance with all such regulations we are subject to the risk that our compliance with such regulations could be challenged noncompliance with certain of these regulations could result in the incurrence of additional costs penalties or assessments that could be material 

our industry is subject to extensive regulation existing or future regulations may restrict our operations increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures and failure to comply with regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses or affect our ability to operate 

we are subject to extensive government regulation in the form of national state and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern all aspects of the operation of our facilities and the transportation and sales of our products we generally expect that regulatory controls worldwide will become increasingly more demanding and expensive but cannot accurately predict future developments 

in addition we are required by various governmental and quasigovernmental agencies to obtain permits licenses and certificates with respect to our operations these permits and licenses are subject to renewal modification and in some circumstances revocation further the permits and licenses are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

our failure to comply with regulatory requirements or obtain or maintain necessary permits licenses and authorizations for the conduct of our business could result in fines or penalties which may be significant additionally any such failure could restrict or otherwise prohibit certain aspects of our operations which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may incur substantial costs to comply with climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives 

there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas “ghg” reduction these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future laws in this field continue to evolve and while they are likely to be increasingly widespread and stringent at this stage it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation within the framework of eu emissions trading we were allocated certain allowances of carbon dioxide per year for the affected plants of our european sites for the 2005 to 2007 period for the second trading period 2008 to 2012 a number of our plants are included in the europewide trading system we expect to incur additional costs as a result of the existing emissions trading scheme and could incur additional costs in relation to any future carbon or other greenhouse gas emission trading schemes the costs could be higher to the extent that we decide to sell credits that we need in the future 

in the us the environmental protection agency the “epa” has promulgated federal ghg regulations under the clean air act affecting certain sources the epa has issued mandatory ghg reporting requirements which could lead to further obligations the recent epa action could be a precursor to further federal regulation of carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases and may affect the outcome of other climate change lawsuits pending in us federal courts in a manner unfavorable to our industry in any event additional regulation is likely to be forthcoming at the us federal level or the state level with respect to ghg emissions and such regulation could result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances 

compliance with these or other changes in laws regulations and obligations that create a ghg emissions trading scheme or ghg reduction policies generally could significantly increase our costs or reduce demand for products we produce depending on the nature of potential regulations and legislation any future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs additional operating restrictions or delays in implementing growth projects or other capital investments and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

  

the company’s business including its results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected by process safety issues 

failure to appropriately manage safety human health product liability and environmental risks associated with the company’s products product life cycles and production processes could adversely impact employees communities stakeholders the company’s reputation and its results of operations public perception of the risks associated with the company’s products and production processes could impact product acceptance and influence the regulatory environment in which the company operates while the company has procedures and controls to manage process safety risks issues could be created by events outside of its control including natural disasters severe weather events and acts of sabotage 

legislation and regulatory initiatives could lead to a decrease in demand for our products 

new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health safety and the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products initiatives by governments and private interest groups will potentially require increased toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us for example in the united states the national toxicology program “ntp” is a federal interagency program that seeks to identify and select for study chemicals and other substances to evaluate potential human health hazards in the european commission reach is regulation designed to identify the intrinsic properties of chemical substances assess hazards and risks of the substances and identify and implement the risk management measures to protect humans and the environment 

assessments by the ntp reach or similar programs or regulations in other jurisdictions may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals we use or produce and may result in additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of those chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

we operate internationally and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations exchange controls political risks and other risks relating to international operations 

we operate internationally and are subject to the risks of doing business on a global level including fluctuations in currency exchange rates transportation delays and interruptions war terrorist activities epidemics pandemics political and economic instability and disruptions restrictions on the transfer of funds the imposition of duties and tariffs import and export controls changes in governmental policies labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments recent demonstrations and popular unrest in portions of the middle east are examples of these events 

these events could reduce the demand for our products decrease the prices at which we can sell our products disrupt production or other operations require substantial capital and other costs to comply andor increase security costs or insurance premiums all of which could reduce our operating results in addition we obtain a substantial portion of our principal raw materials from international sources that are subject to these same risks our compliance with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject could be challenged furthermore these laws may be modified the result of which may be to prevent or limit subsidiaries from transferring cash to us 

furthermore we are subject to certain existing and may be subject to possible future laws that limit or may limit our activities while some of our competitors may not be subject to such laws which may adversely affect our competitiveness 

in addition we generate revenues from export sales and operations that may be denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency exchange rates between these currencies and functional currencies in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future future events which may significantly increase or 

  

decrease the risk of future movement in currencies in which we conduct our business cannot be predicted we also may hedge certain revenues and costs using derivative instruments to minimize the impact of changes in the exchange rates of those currencies compared to the respective functional currencies it is possible that fluctuations in exchange rates will result in reduced operating results 

us antiinversion rules may apply to lyondellbasell industries nv resulting in adverse us federal income tax consequences 

the us internal revenue service is examining the company’s federal income tax returns as part of that review the irs is examining whether under section 7874 of the internal revenue code lyondellbasell industries nv should be treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes the irs also is examining whether section 7874 alternatively applies to certain of the company’s intercompany transactions that would result in additional us federal income tax of the company’s us subsidiaries application of section 7874 in either instance is dependent on the value of our shares issued at emergence from bankruptcy to former creditors of our top us holding company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries in exchange for their claims against those entities it further would require a determination that the company is not conducting substantial business activities in the netherlands 

treatment of lyondellbasell industries nv as a us corporation would result in significantly increased tax liability because our worldwide income would be subject to us federal income tax any such increase likely would have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cashflow application of section 7874 to our intercompany transactions would for the 10year period post emergence result in the imposition of additional us federal income tax on certain gains of our us subsidiaries from those transactions the increased taxation of those gains would negatively affect our earnings and cash flows 

no assurance can be given that the irs will not determine that section 7874 is applicable to us further there can be no assurances that any such position taken by the irs would not be sustained 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may adversely affect the valuation of pension obligations the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets may result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets particularly equity securities or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets any change in key actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate would impact the valuation of pension obligations affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years 

certain of our current pension plans have projected benefit obligations that exceed the fair value of the plan assets as of december 31 2011 the aggregate deficit was 1079 million any declines in the fair values of the pension plans assets could require additional payments by us in order to maintain specified funding levels 

our pension plans are subject to legislative and regulatory requirements of applicable jurisdictions which could include under certain circumstances local governmental authority to terminate the plan 

we may be required to record material charges against our earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets 

we may be required to reduce production at or idle facilities for extended periods of time or exit certain businesses as a result of the cyclical nature of our industry specifically oversupplies of or lack of demand for particular products or high raw material prices may cause us to reduce production we may choose to reduce production at certain facilities because we have offtake arrangements at other facilities which make any reductions or idling unavailable at those facilities any decision to permanently close facilities or exit a business likely would result in impairment and other charges to earnings 

temporary outages at our facilities can last for several quarters and sometimes longer these outages could cause us to incur significant costs including the expenses of maintaining and restarting these facilities in addition even though we may reduce production at facilities we may be required to continue to purchase or pay for utilities or raw materials under takeorpay supply agreements 

many of our businesses depend on our intellectual property our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and our inability to do so could reduce our ability to maintain our competitiveness and margins 

we have a significant worldwide patent portfolio of issued and pending patents these patents together with proprietary technical knowhow are significant to our competitive position particularly with regard to po performance chemicals petrochemicals and polymers including process technologies such as spheripol  spherizone  hostalen  spherilene  lupotech t and avant catalyst family technology rights we rely on the patent copyright and trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing however we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without authorization proceedings to protect these rights could be costly and we may not prevail 

the protection afforded by patents varies from country to country and depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage while a presumption of validity exists with respect to patents issued to us our patents may be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable as patents expire the products and processes described and claimed under those patents become generally available for use by competitors 

  

our continued growth strategy may bring us to regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce in addition patent rights may not prevent our competitors from developing using or selling products that are similar or functionally equivalent to our products moreover our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner which could result in significantly lower revenues reduced profit margins or loss of market share 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary knowhow and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property these confidentiality agreements may be breached may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies may not be available additionally others could obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal or illegal means 

the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes apparatuses technology trade secrets or proprietary knowhow could result in significantly lower revenues reduced profit margins and cash flows andor loss of market share we also may be subject to claims that our technology patents or other intellectual property infringes on a third party’s intellectual property rights unfavorable resolution of these claims could result in restrictions on our ability to deliver the related service or in a settlement that could be material to us 

we may not be able to fully or successfully implement our ongoing plans to improve and globally integrate our business processes and functions 

we continue to seek ways to drive greater productivity flexibility and cost savings in particular we are working towards the improvement and global integration of our business processes and functions as part of these efforts we have been centralizing certain functions implementing new information technology and integrating our existing information technology systems 

our ongoing implementation of organizational improvements is made more difficult by our need to coordinate geographically dispersed operations inabilities and delays in implementing improvements can negatively affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings in addition the process of organizational improvements may cause interruptions of or loss of momentum in the activities of our businesses it may also result in the loss of personnel or other labor issues these issues as well as any information technology systems failures also could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 

additionally from time to time certain aspects of our business processes may be outsourced to third parties the processes or the portions thereof that are outsourced generally will tend to be labor intensive transactional activities such as processing invoices for account payable transactions although we make a diligent effort to ensure that all providers of outsourced services observe proper internal control practices and procedures we cannot assure that failures will not occur the failure of such third parties to provide adequate services could adversely affect our results of operations liquidity or our ability to provide adequate financial and management reporting 

increased it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products facilities and services 

increased global it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products facilities and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations 

  

shared control or lack of control of joint ventures may delay decisions or actions regarding the joint ventures 

a portion of our operations are conducted through joint ventures where control may be exercised by or shared with unaffiliated third parties we cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners including any nonperformance default or bankruptcy of joint venture partners the joint ventures that we do not control may also lack adequate internal controls systems or financial reporting systems to provide adequate and timely information for our reporting purposes 

in the event that any of our joint venture partners do not observe their obligations it is possible that the affected joint venture would not be able to operate in accordance with our business plans as a result we could be required to increase our level of commitment in order to give effect to such plans differences in views among the joint venture participants also may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major matters potentially adversely affecting the business and operations of the joint ventures and in turn our business and operations  

our capital requirements could limit or cause us to change our growth and development plans 

at december 31 2011 we have approximately 40 billion of total consolidated debt our debt and the limitations imposed on us by our financing arrangements could 

 

  

  

 if our cash flow from operations and capital resources were reduced we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or other planned uses of our cash due to our substantial debt service obligations we could choose to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness but there can be no assurances that we would be able to do so on terms we deem acceptable if at all additionally our debt instruments may limit our ability to effect such actions 

our debt or other financing arrangements contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us there also is a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio contained in our us abl facility that is applicable if availability under the facility falls below certain levels we currently are in compliance with all of our restrictive and financial covenants however the ability to meet financial requirements can be affected by events beyond our control and over time these covenants may not be satisfied 

a breach of covenants of or the failure to pay principal and interest when due under our debt or other financing could result in a default or crossdefault under all or some of those instruments any such default could result in an acceleration of all amounts outstanding under all facilities and could relieve counterparties of their obligations to fund or otherwise make advances without waivers from the parties to our financing arrangements any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate 

a substantial portion of our shares are owned by a few persons and their interests in lyondellbasell industries nv may conflict with other stakeholders’ interests 

as of february 24 2012 two of our shareholders collectively own approximately 44  of our outstanding ordinary shares under dutch law there are no quorum requirements for shareholder voting and most matters are approved or adopted by a majority of votes cast as a result as long as these shareholders or any other substantial shareholder own directly or indirectly a substantial portion of our outstanding shares they will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring shareholder approval including amendments to our articles of association the election of directors significant corporate transactions dividend payments and other matters these shareholders may have interests that conflict with other stakeholders including holders of our notes and actions may be taken that other stakeholders do not view as beneficial 

  

additionally these shareholders are party to nomination agreements that entitle each of the shareholders to cause our supervisory board to nominate for election members to our supervisory board for so long as the shareholder owns specified percentages of our ordinary shares 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the identification and development of talent to succeed senior management 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and we rely heavily on our management team the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations in addition because of the reliance on our management team our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management the retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our strategies

 intellectual property 

we maintain an extensive patent portfolio and continue to file new patent applications in the us and other countries as of december 31 2011 we owned approximately 6200 patents and patent applications worldwide our patents and trade secrets cover our processes products and catalysts and are significant to our competitive position particularly with regard to propylene oxide intermediate chemicals petrochemicals polymers and our process technologies such as spheripol  spherizone  hostalen  spherilene  lupotech  glacido  vacido  isomplus and avant catalysts we own globally registered and unregistered trademarks including the “lyondellbasell” “lyondell” and “equistar” trade names while we believe that our intellectual property provides competitive advantages we do not regard our businesses as being materially dependent upon any single patent trade secret or trademark some of our heritage production capacity operates under licenses from third parties 

we rely on patent copyright and trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing our employees working on these technologies are required to enter into agreements or are covered by other arrangements such as collective bargaining agreements providing for confidentiality and the assignment of rights to inventions made by them while employed by us 

environmental 

regulation 

we are subject to extensive international national state local and environmental laws regulations directives rules and ordinances concerning and are required to have permits and licenses regulating emissions to the air discharges onto land or waters and the generation handling storage transportation treatment disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials 

under the european union “eu” integrated pollution prevention and control directive “ippc” eu member state governments are to adopt rules and implement an environmental permitting program relating to air water and waste for individual facilities the eu countries are at varying stages in their respective implementation of the ippc permit program we do not know with certainty what future ippc permits will require or the future costs of compliance with the ippc permit program the eu also has passed legislation governing the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals known as reach pursuant to which we are required to register chemicals and gain authorization for the use of certain substances as an importer of chemicals and materials from outside the eu we are subject to additional registration obligations 

we also are subject to environmental laws that may have a significant effect on the nature and scope of cleanup of contamination at current and former operating facilities and at other sites at which hazardous substances generated by our current or former subsidiaries were disposed such laws may also have a significant effect on the costs of transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products and the costs of the storage and disposal of wastewater in the us the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended and also known as superfund “cercla” imposes joint and several liability for the costs of remedial investigations and cleanup actions as well as damages to natural resources on entities that generated hazardous substances arranged for disposal of the hazardous substances transported to or selected the disposal sites and the past and present owners and operators of such sites all such responsible parties or any one of them can be required to bear all of such costs regardless of fault the legality of the original disposal or ownership of the disposal site we are subject to potential liability under cercla as an owner or operator of facilities at which hazardous substances have been disposed or as a generator or transporter of hazardous substances disposed at other locations 

under the eu environmental liability directive eu member states can require the remediation of soil and groundwater contamination in certain circumstances under the “polluter pays principle” the scope of events and circumstances that could trigger remediation requirements and the level of remediation required vary from member state to member state 

  

under the us resource conservation and recovery act of 1976 “rcra” various us state and nonus government regulations regulate the handling transporting and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous waste our manufacturing sites have and may in the future handle onsite waste disposal subjecting us to these laws and regulations 

capital expenditures 

in some cases compliance with environmental health and safety laws and regulations can only be achieved by capital expenditures regulatoryrelated capital expenditures at our facilities were 125 million 121 million and 250 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively and we estimate such expenditures to be approximately 204 million in 2012 and 210 million in 2013 

our regulatoryrelated capital expenditures in 2011 primarily relate to projects designed to reduce and control emissions from our plant operations in both the us and europe 

stricter environmental safety and health laws regulations and enforcement policies could result in increased environmental capital expenditures by us above current estimates 

employee relations 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 14000 fulltime and parttime employees of these approximately 5800 were in north america approximately 6800 were in europe and approximately 1400 were in other locations 

as of december 31 2011 approximately 900 of our employees in north america are represented by labor unions the vast majority of our employees in europe and south america are subject to staff council or works council coverage or collective bargaining agreements 

in addition to our own employees we use the services of contractors in the routine conduct of our businesses 

we believe our relations with our employees are good

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend bankruptcy proceedings 

on january 6 2009 certain of lyondellbasell af’s indirect us subsidiaries including lyondell chemical and its german indirect subsidiary basell germany holdings gmbh voluntarily filed for protection under chapter 11 in the bankruptcy court in april and may of 2009 lyondellbasell af and certain other subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 in the bankruptcy court the bankruptcy cases were filed in response to a sudden loss of liquidity in the last quarter of 2008 the debtors operated their businesses and managed their properties as debtors in possession during the bankruptcy cases in general this means that the debtors operated in the ordinary course without bankruptcy court intervention bankruptcy court approval was required however where the debtors sought authorization to engage in certain transactions not in the ordinary course of business 

we emerged from bankruptcy on april 30 2010 as of that date all assets of the debtor entities vested in the reorganized debtor entities free and clear of all claims liens encumbrances charges and other interests except as provided in the plan of reorganization or the confirmation order entered on april 23 2010 the “confirmation order” except as otherwise expressly provided in the plan of reorganization or in the confirmation order on april 30 2010 each holder of a claim or equity interest is deemed to have forever waived released and discharged the debtor entities and the reorganized debtor entities to the fullest extent permitted by law of and from any and all claims equity interests rights and liabilities that arose prior to the confirmation date 

environmental matters

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report when we use the terms “we” “us” “our” or similar words in this discussion unless the context otherwise requires we are referring to lyondellbasell industries nv and its consolidated subsidiaries we also refer to the company as “lyondellbasell nv” the “successor company” and the “successor” 

in addition to comparisons of current operating results with the same period in the prior year we have included as additional disclosure certain “trailing quarter” comparisons of fourth quarter 2011 operating results to third quarter 2011 operating results our businesses are highly cyclical in addition to experiencing some less significant seasonal effects trailing quarter comparisons may offer important insight into current business direction 

references to industry benchmark prices or costs including the weighted average cost of ethylene production are generally to industry prices and costs reported by cmai except that references to industry benchmarks for refining and oxyfuels market margins are to industry prices reported by platts a reporting service of the mcgrawhill companies and crude oil and natural gas benchmark price references are to bloomberg 

overview 

our performance is driven by among other things global economic conditions generally and their impact on demand for our products raw material and energy prices and industryspecific issues such as production capacity our businesses are subject to the cyclicality and volatility seen in the chemicals and refining industries generally 

lyondellbasell nv the successor holding company owns and operates directly and indirectly substantially the same business owned and operated by lyondellbasell af prior to the company’s emergence from bankruptcy for accounting purposes the operations of lyondellbasell af are deemed to have ceased on april 30 2010 and lyondellbasell nv is deemed to have begun operations on that date effective may 1 2010 we adopted freshstart accounting references in the following discussions to the “company” for periods prior to april 30 2010 the emergence date are to the predecessor company and for periods after the emergence date to the successor company 

to ensure a proper analysis of the year over year results the effects of freshstart accounting on the successor period are specifically addressed throughout this discussion the primary impacts of our reorganization pursuant to the plan of reorganization and the adoption of freshstart accounting on our results of operations are as follows 

tax impact of reorganization —the application of the tax provisions of the internal revenue code to the plan of reorganization resulted in the reduction or elimination of the majority of our tax attributes that otherwise would have carried forward into 2011 and later years as a result we did not retain any us net operating loss carryforwards alternative minimum tax credits or capital loss carryforwards after 2010 in addition a significant portion of our tax basis in depreciable assets was eliminated accordingly we estimate our cash tax liabilities for the years following 2010 will be relatively higher than in 2009 or 2010 as a result of certain prior year limitations on the deductibility of our interest expense in the us we retained approximately 2500 million of interest carryforwards which are available to offset future taxable income subject to certain limitations 

inventory —we adopted the last in first out “lifo” method of accounting for inventory upon implementation of freshstart accounting prior to the emergence from bankruptcy lyondellbasell af used both the first in first out “fifo” and lifo methods of accounting to determine inventory cost for purposes of evaluating segment results management reviewed operating results for lyondellbasell af that were determined using current cost which approximates results using the lifo method of accounting for inventory subsequent to the emergence date our 

  

operating results are reviewed using the lifo method of accounting for inventory while determining the impact of the adoption of lifo on predecessor periods is not practicable we believe that the current cost method used by the predecessor for segment reporting is similar to lifo and the current cost method would have resulted in a decrease of cost of sales of 29 million and 199 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2009 and four months ended april 30 2010 respectively 

in addition on april 30 2010 pursuant to asc topic 852 reorganizations  we recorded inventory at fair value the increase in inventory of 1297 million was primarily in the us and was largely driven by the price of crude oil in the 2010 successor period lower market prices primarily for polypropylene resulted in a 42 million lower of cost or market charge to adjust the value of our finished goods inventory to market the effect of this adjustment to the value of our inventory is reflected in cost of sales for the 2010 successor period 

depreciation and amortization expense —depreciation and amortization expense is lower in the successor periods as a result of our revaluation of assets for freshstart accounting for additional information on the revaluation of assets see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements depreciation and amortization as reported for all periods presented is as follows 

 

 interest expense —lower interest expense in the 2010 successor period was largely driven by the discharge or repayment of debt upon which interest was accruing during the bankruptcy through the company’s reorganization on april 30 2010 pursuant to the plan of reorganization partially offset by interest expense on the new debt incurred as part of the emergence from bankruptcy interest expense in 2011 which was lower compared to the combined 2010 successor and predecessor periods reflects the repayment of 4288 million principal amount of debt since the beginning of the fourth quarter 2010 this benefit was partially offset by the premiums and other costs associated with the prepayments as well as interest expense on the senior 6 notes issued in november 2011 

 

   

foreign currency translations of nonus denominated financial statements —in countries outside of the united states we generally generate revenues and incur operating expenses denominated in local currencies the predominant local currency of our operations outside of the united states is the euro the gains and losses that result from the process of translating foreign functional currency financial statements to us dollars are included in other comprehensive income loss in stockholders’ equity these translation adjustments may be significant in any given period based on the fluctuations of the euro relative to the us dollar a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro in 2011 resulted in a loss of 237 million the net loss which is reflected in the 237 million loss in other comprehensive income on the consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity at december 31 2011 represents a net decrease in comprehensive income during 2011 

overview of results of operations 

2011 versus 2010 —business conditions in 2011 were improved over 2010 despite a significant economic slowdown particularly in europe in the fourth quarter 2011 underlying business fundamentals in 2011 were similar to those experienced in 2010 including the low price of natural gas in north america relative to the global price of crude oil in 2011 lower prices for natural gasbased liquid feedstocks particularly ethane relative to the prices of crudeoil based feedstocks provided an advantage for producers with the capability to shift the raw material ratio between these raw material groups also in 2011 in an otherwise weak market gulf coast refiners of heavy crude oil benefited from discounts on the price of heavy crude oil 

although results were impacted by an economic slowdown in the fourth quarter overall results for 2011 were strong in most of our businesses the op—americas segment benefited from strong margins for ethylene and ethylene coproducts amid growing economic uncertainty in europe continued strong results for our differentiated pp compounding products coupled with earnings from our joint ventures enabled our op—eai segment to maintain results at the 2010 level id segment results were bolstered by strong product margins across most businesses particularly bdo eo and derivatives and acetyls reflecting improved automotive and durable goods demand the refining and oxyfuels segment results were higher primarily due to higher refining margins and higher crude processing rates at the houston refinery and higher oxyfuels margins which more than offset fourth quarter 2011 charges related to the suspension of operations at the berre refinery and significantly lower fourth quarter refining margins results for our technology segment were comparable in 2011 and 2010 as lower revenue recognized in 2011 from process licenses issued in prior years and higher rd costs offset the effects of higher operating results for catalysts 

2010 versus 2009 —global market conditions in 2010 improved from the weak conditions experienced throughout most of 2009 as demand in the durable goods sector particularly the automotive markets was higher than in 2009 as a result demand and operating rates were higher in 2010 than in 2009 in addition certain of our business segments benefited from planned and unplanned competitor operating disruptions particularly during the second quarter 2010 

excluding the impacts of freshstart accounting discussed above operating results in 2010 generally reflected higher product margins and higher sales volumes compared to 2009 reliable operations and the effect of industry supply disruptions resulted in higher product margins and higher sales volumes in the opamericas segment higher operating results in the opeai and the id businesses were primarily a reflection of higher sales volumes and higher product margins due to improvement in the durable goods markets especially the automotive market the refining and oxyfuels segment results were higher in 2010 primarily due to higher refining margins at the houston refinery lower licensing revenue contributed to lower results in the technology segment 

  

results of operations for the successor and predecessor periods discussed in these “results of operations” are presented in the table below 

 

 segment operating results discussed below are reviewed for the successor period using the lifo method of accounting for inventory and were reviewed for the predecessor periods on a current cost basis 

results of operations 

revenues —we had revenues of 51035 million in 2011 41151 million in 2010 and 30828 million in 2009 revenues increased 9884 million or 24 in 2011 compared to 2010 higher average sales prices which reflect higher raw material costs improved supplydemand fundamentals in the opamericas and id segments and higher refining margins at our houston refinery were responsible for a 20 increase in revenues the effect of higher sales volumes primarily at the houston refinery was responsible for a 4 increase in revenues 

revenues in 2010 increased 10323 or 33 compared to 2009 higher average product sales prices were responsible for nearly all of the 33 revenue increase in 2010 a slight 1 increase in revenues resulting from the effect of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 was mostly offset by lower licensing revenue in the technology segment higher crudeoil and natural gas prices also contributed to the increase in average sales prices in 2010 

cost of sales —cost of sales were 45913 million in 2011 37181 million in 2010 and 29516 million in 2009 the 8732 million increase in cost of sales in 2011 was primarily due to higher raw material costs which reflect the effects of higher prices for crude oil and other hydrocarbons compared to 2010 cost of sales for 2011 includes charges totaling 191 million primarily relating to the estimated cost of a social plan associated with the suspension of operations at our berre refinery impairments of assets and increases in environmental liabilities and asset retirement obligations these charges were partially offset by a benefit from 187 million of lower depreciation and amortization in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the 7474 million writedown of property plant and equipment associated with the april 2010 revaluation of our assets in freshstart accounting the 2010 successor period included a 64 million noncash charge as a change in estimate related to a dispute that arose during the third quarter 2010 over an environmental liability 

  

the 7665 million increase in cost of sales in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to higher raw material costs which reflect the effects of higher crude oil and natural gas liquidsbased raw material prices as well as the effect of higher sales volumes cost of sales in the successor period also included the 64 million change in estimate described above lower depreciation and amortization expense of 630 million due to the writedown of property plant and equipment associated with the revaluation of our assets in freshstart accounting partially offset the higher costs in the successor period the predecessor period in 2010 included a charge of 23 million for plant closure and other costs related to a polypropylene plant in terni italy 

sga expenses —selling general and administrative “sga” expenses were 928 million in 2011 872 million in 2010 and 850 million in 2009 the 56 million increase in 2011 reflects charges associated with activities to reorganize certain functional organizations and incentive compensation related to the special dividend paid in december 2011 these increases were partially offset by lower employeerelated expense associated with the lower headcount in 2011 

operating income —the company had operating income of 3998 million 2944 million and 317 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively results for the underlying operations of the company increased in 2011 compared to 2010 despite a significant decrease in operating results in the fourth quarter 2011 the increase primarily reflects higher product margins for ethylene butanediol eo and derivatives and acetyls as well as higher refining margins at our houston refinery operating results for 2011 include charges totaling 307 million primarily related to the estimated cost of a social plan associated with the suspension of operations at our berre refinery activities to reorganize certain functional organizations impairments of assets and increases in environmental liabilities and asset retirement obligations these charges were partially offset by benefits of 90 million related to the sale of excess precious metals and proceeds from insurance and other settlements 

the results of our underlying operations improved in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting higher product margins and the effect of higher sales volumes as demand increased due to improved global market conditions particularly in the first half of the year compared to the same periods in 2009 when demand was very weak operating results in the 2010 successor period were negatively impacted by noncash charges described above of 64 million and 42 million respectively related to a change in estimate associated with a dispute over an environmental liability and the adjustment of inventory to the lower of cost or market 

operating results in 2011 and in the 2010 successor period also benefited from lower depreciation and amortization expense of 192 million and 651 million respectively primarily due to the writedown of property plant and equipment associated with the revaluation of our assets in freshstart accounting in april 2010 operating results for each of our business segments are reviewed further in the “segment analysis” section below 

interest expense —interest expense was 1044 million in 2011 1258 million in 2010 and 1795 million in 2009 the 214 million decrease in interest expense in 2011 reflects the repayment of 4288 million principal amount of debt since the beginning of the fourth quarter 2010 partially offset by 443 million of prepayment premiums and unamortized debt issuance cost writeoffs related to the 2011 repayments the prepayment of debt in 2011 included 1731 million of our 8 senior notes 1319 million of our 11 senior notes and the remaining 5 million outstanding under our senior term loan facility interest expense for 2011 also includes interest on our newly issued 6 senior notes due 2021 

interest expense was 537 million lower in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the repayment or discharge of debt on the emergence date in accordance with the plan of reorganization upon which interest was accruing during the bankruptcy and the repayment of 1233 million of debt in the fourth quarter 2010 this decrease in interest expense was partially offset by interest expense on the debt incurred as part of the emergence financing see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and 26 million of charges related to the prepayment of 769 million of debt in december 2010 the prepayment of debt included 275 million of our 8 senior secured notes and 494 million of the senior secured term loan facility in december 2010 we also repaid 464 million under the accounts receivable securitization facility and accounts receivable factoring agreement during october and november of 2010 

  

other income expense net— the company had other income net of 25 million in 2011 other expense net of 368 million in 2010 and other income net of 320 million in 2009 other income net in 2011 included gains of 41 million related to the sale of excess precious metals 15 million related to the sale of scrap at one of our plants and 15 million related to a settlement associated with the july 2008 crane incident at our houston refinery these gains were partially offset by the negative effect of the 37 million fair value adjustment of the warrants to purchase our shares and 17 million of foreign exchange losses 

other expense net in 2010 included the negative effect of the fair value adjustment of the warrants to purchase our shares of 114 million and foreign exchange losses of 240 million in 2009 the company recognized involuntary conversion gains of 120 million representing partial insurance settlements of claims related to damages sustained in 2005 at the polymers plant in münchsmünster germany and foreign exchange gains of 123 million as a result of changes in currency exchange rates other income net in 2009 also included benefits totaling 72 million resulting from indemnification payments received from previous plant owners for employee benefit and environmental remediation costs related to plant closures and a 15 million gain related to settlement of a uk pension claim 

the foreign exchange loss of 240 million in 2010 and gain of 123 million in 2009 were primarily the result of the revaluation of third party debt of certain of the company’s subsidiaries due to changes in the foreign exchange rates in effect during those periods such debt was denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the subsidiaries and was refinanced upon emergence from bankruptcy 

income loss from equity investments —the company had income from equity investments totaling 216 million in 2011 170 million in 2010 and a loss from equity investments of 181 million in 2009 the increase of 46 million in 2011 primarily reflects the addition of capacity at our hmc joint venture in late 2010 and the operations of our joint venture in ningbo china which commenced operations in june 2010 the benefit of these joint ventures was partially offset by lower results of our joint venture located in poland 

income from equity investments in 2010 benefited from the operations of our sepc joint venture which commenced operations in june 2009 and from a new polypropylene plant operated by our hmc polymers company ltd joint venture that commenced operations in october 2010 the loss from equity investments in 2009 included a 228 million charge for impairment of the carrying value of the company’s investments in certain joint ventures 

reorganization items —the company had reorganization expense of 45 million in 2011 income from reorganization items totaling 7365 million in 2010 and reorganization expense of 2961 million in 2009 reorganization items in 2011 include charges totaling 32 million related to an estimated claim associated with a lawsuit filed by basf for additional information related to this claim see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

gains from reorganization items in the 2010 predecessor period included gains totaling 13617 million related to settlement of liabilities subject to compromise deconsolidation of entities upon emergence adjustments related to rejected contracts and a reduction of environmental remediation liabilities these gains were partially offset by a charge of 6278 million related to the changes in net assets resulting from the application of freshstart accounting and by several onetime emergence costs including the success and other fees earned by certain professionals upon the company’s emergence from bankruptcy damages related to the rejection of executory contracts and plant closure costs reorganization items expense in the 2010 successor period is primarily related to professional fees 

the 2009 period included charges for the write off of assets associated with a lease rejection damage claims related to certain executory contracts the net write off of unamortized debt issuance costs premiums and discounts environmental liabilities professional fees associated with the chapter 11 proceedings shutdown costs related primarily to the shutdown of its olefins plant at chocolate bayou texas and the longterm idling of its ethylene glycol facility in beaumont texas as well as employee severance and other costs for additional information on reorganization items see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

income tax —our effective income tax rate of 329 in 2011 resulted in a tax provision of 1048 million on pretax income of 3188 million in the eight months ended december 31 2010 the successor recorded a tax provision of 170 million representing an effective tax rate of 101 on pretax income of 1686 million in the four months ended april 30 2010 the predecessor recorded a tax benefit of 1315 million representing a negative effective tax rate of 183 on pretax income of 7189 million during 2009 the predecessor recorded a tax benefit of 1411 million representing an effective tax rate of 329 on a pretax loss of 4282 million 

the effective income tax rate for the twelve months ended december 31 2011 was lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35 primarily due to the effect of income being taxed in countries with lower statutory income tax rates and favorable permanent deductions related to certain or our notional royalties equity earnings and the us domestic production activity deduction the provision for the 2010 successor period differs from the us statutory income tax rate of 35 primarily due to the fact that in several countries the company generated either income with no tax expense or losses where we recorded no tax benefit due to valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets in those countries the tax provision for the 2010 predecessor period was significantly lower than the us statutory income tax rate primarily because a substantial portion of the pretax gain from the discharge of prepetition liabilities was not subject to income tax this benefit was partially offset by restructuring charges for which no tax benefit was provided the tax benefit recorded for 2009 was lower than the us statutory income tax rate of 35 primarily due to operations in nonus jurisdictions with rates lower than the us statutory rate this benefit was partially offset by restructuring costs for which no tax benefit was provided 

income loss from continuing operations —income from continuing operations was 2140 million in 2011 and 10020 million in 2010 and losses from continuing operations were 2871 million in 2009 the following table summarizes the major components contributing to the income loss from continuing operations 

 

 in 2009 the loss from equity investments for the op—eai segment included charges of 228 million for impairment of the carrying value of the company’s equity investments in certain joint ventures see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the table below summarizes items of special note with regards to our income loss from continuing operations for the periods shown 

 

 impairments in 2009 include an immaterial adjustment related to prior periods which increased income from operations and net income for the threemonth period ended december 31 2009 by 65 million the adjustment related to an overstatement of goodwill impairment in 2008 

income from discontinued operations net of tax —the company had income from discontinued operations of 64 million in the 2010 successor period related to the sale of its flavor and fragrance chemicals business 

fourth quarter 2011 versus third quarter 2011 —the company had a net loss of 218 million in the fourth quarter compared to net income of 895 million in the third quarter the fourth quarter net loss reflected pretax charges totaling 614 million related to the early repayment of debt reorganization items the anticipated cost of the social plan related to the suspension of operations at the berre refinery corporate restructurings environmental charges and fair value adjustment of our outstanding warrants these fourth quarter charges were partially offset by a 15 million pretax settlement related to the 2008 crane collapse at our houston refinery net income in the third quarter reflected pretax charges totaling 81 million related to compensation expense impairment of an rd project in europe an asset retirement obligation associated with our berre refinery and activities to reorganize certain functional organizations in europe these charges were partially offset by benefits totaling 44 million including the fair value adjustment of our outstanding warrants 

  

apart from these items the net loss in the fourth quarter reflected a decline in operating results in all but our technology segment which experienced comparable results to the third quarter the refining and oxyfuels segment reflected the effect of significantly lower refining margins especially at the houston refinery results for our op—eai and id segments reflected the effect of poor european economic conditions and a yearend slowdown as margins and volumes for most products declined the op—americas segment primarily reflected the decline in the average sales prices for ethylene coproducts and ethylene the effect of the decline in operating results was partially offset by a 92 million tax benefit in the fourth quarter compared to a 489 million provision for income taxes in the third quarter the 581 million decrease in tax expense was primarily attributable to lower actual earnings coupled with an increase in the favorable permanent deductions related to notional royalties equity earnings and the us domestic production activity deduction section 199 offset with a reduction in the release of foreign valuation allowances 

segment analysis 

our operations are in five reportable segments op—americas op—eai id refining and oxyfuels and technology these operations comprise substantially the same businesses owned and operated by lyondellbasell af prior to the company’s emergence from bankruptcy however for accounting purposes the operations of lyondellbasell af are deemed to have ceased on april 30 2010 and lyondellbasell nv is deemed to have begun operations on that date the results of operations for the successor are not comparable to the predecessor due to adjustments made under freshstart accounting as described in “overview” the impact of these items is addressed in the discussion of each segment’s results below 

  

the following tables reflect selected financial information for our reportable segments operating income loss for segment reporting is on a lifo basis for the successor and on a current cost basis for the predecessor 

 

 olefins and polyolefins—americas segment 

2011 versus 2010 —the us ethylene industry continued to benefit from processing natural gas liquids in 2011 the cost of ethylene produced from natural gas liquids continues to be lower compared to that produced from crude oilbased liquids which is the predominant feedstock used in the rest of the world ethylene margins remained strong in 2011 primarily due to advantaged prices for ethane which was the favored feedstock coproduct sales prices which remained high in 2011 despite a fourth quarter decline also contributed to the strength of ethylene margins market demand for polyethylene was relatively unchanged in 2011 but higher prices driven by increased raw material costs dampened demand for us polypropylene 

operating results for 2011 and the 2010 successor period include the impacts of freshstart accounting including the benefit of lower depreciation and amortization expense related to the writedown of segment assets the 2010 successor period also includes the negative impact of a noncash charge to adjust inventory to market value see “results of operationscost of sales” 

  

2010 versus 2009 —market demand in the us for ethylene was higher in 2010 compared to 2009 as a result of higher industry operating rates compared to rates experienced during 2009 ethylene margins were higher as benchmark sales prices increased significantly more than the benchmark weighted average costs of ethylene production sales of polyolefins in 2010 were comparable to 2009 although producers favored domestic market sales over exports due to improved domestic demand 

operating results for 2010 primarily reflected strong demand and higher margins for ethylene due to improved economic conditions in 2010 and unplanned operating issues and turnarounds at competitor facilities in the first half of the year polypropylene results were also higher in 2010 compared to 2009 as us economic conditions improved demand for polyethylene in 2010 was comparable to 2009 operating results for the successor period reflect the impacts of the company’s reorganization and freshstart accounting including a noncash charge to adjust inventory to market value and the benefit of lower depreciation and amortization expense related to the writedown of segment assets see “results of operations—cost of sales” the net effect of these items contributed to the significantly improved results of operations in the 2010 successor periods compared to the twelve months of 2009 

ethylene raw materials —benchmark crude oil and natural gas prices generally have been indicators of the level and direction of the movement of raw material and energy costs for ethylene and its coproducts in the op—americas segment ethylene and its coproducts are produced from two major raw material groups 

 

  

 although the prices of these raw materials are generally related to crude oil and natural gas prices during specific periods the relationships among these materials and benchmarks may vary significantly 

in the us we have a significant capability to shift the ratio of raw materials used in the production of ethylene and its coproducts to take advantage of the relative costs of heavy liquids and ngls 

production economics for the industry continued to favor ngls in 2011 as a result we further increased our use of ngls and reduced liquids consumption at our us plants during 2011 approximately 75 of our us ethylene production was produced from ngls compared to 70 in 2010 

  

the following table shows the average us benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas for the applicable periods as well as benchmark us sales prices for ethylene and propylene which we produce and sell or consume internally and certain polyethylene and polypropylene products the benchmark weighted average cost of ethylene production which is reduced by coproduct revenues is based on cmai’s estimated ratio of heavy liquid raw materials and ngls used in us ethylene production 

 

 the following table sets forth the op—americas segment’s sales and other operating revenues operating income income from equity investments and selected product sales volumes 

 

 revenues —revenues increased by 2291 million or 18 in 2011 compared to 2010 higher average sales prices for most products in 2011 were responsible for revenue increases of 22 while lower sales volumes reduced revenues by 4 in 2011 compared to 2010 an improved supplydemand balance and higher crudeoil based raw material costs were reflected in the higher average sales prices in 2011 

revenues in 2010 increased by 3975 million or 46 compared to 2009 primarily as a result of significantly higher average sales prices the increased sales prices in the 2010 periods reflect an increase in demand resulting from improved economic conditions and the effect of constrained supply due to operating issues and turnarounds at competitor plants 

  

operating income —operating results reflected an increase of 494 million in 2011 compared to 2010 and an increase of 1194 million in 2010 compared to 2009 

the 494 million increase in operating results for 2011 was primarily due to higher ethylene product margins which were partially offset by lower product margins for polyethylene and polypropylene and the effect of lower ethylene and polypropylene sales volumes the higher ethylene margins reflected increases in the average sales prices of ethylene and ethylene coproducts during 2011 which more than offset increases in raw material prices polyethylene and polypropylene product margins were lower in 2011 compared to 2010 as increases in raw material costs outpaced the increases in average sales prices operating results for 2011 were negatively impacted by a major turnaround at our channelview plant and a utility supplier outage at our morris illinois facility as well as planned and unplanned outages at our polypropylene plants operating results for 2011 benefited from 64 million of lower depreciation expense compared to 2010 as a result of the application of freshstart accounting and the revaluation of our assets while the 2010 successor period results were negatively impacted by a 34 million noncash charge to adjust inventory to market value 

the underlying operations increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher product margins for ethylene as higher average sales prices for ethylene and its coproducts more than offset higher raw material costs in addition the effect of higher polypropylene sales volumes during 2010 partially offset the effect of higher utility planned maintenance and other costs operating results for the 2010 successor period were impacted by the noncash inventory charge described above lower depreciation and amortization expense of 204 million in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily the result of the writedown of property plant and equipment associated with the revaluation of our assets in freshstart accounting 

fourth quarter 2011 versus third quarter 2011 —operating income decreased from 599 million in the third quarter to 328 million in the fourth quarter the decrease in fourth quarter operating results reflects lower product margins across all businesses primarily ethylene and the effect of lower ethylene sales volumes the lower ethylene margins are primarily the result of a decline in the average sales prices for ethylene coproducts and ethylene from those experienced in the third quarter an economic slowdown during the fourth quarter led to lower demand resulting in a decrease in ethylene sales volumes the lower product margins for polyethylene and polypropylene reflect the effect of lower prices of ethylene and propylene respectively which were both outpaced by the decrease in average sales prices polyolefins sales volumes were relatively unchanged in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter 

olefins and polyolefins—europe asia and international segment 

2011 versus 2010 —market conditions which were strong in the first half of 2011 began to deteriorate in the third quarter and continued to decline rapidly in the fourth quarter of 2011 the decline was most evident in the slowdown experienced in europe amid uncertainty and poor economic conditions an industry wide inventory adjustment that occurred during the fourth quarter 2011 as producers drew down existing inventories led to a decline in prices from the high levels experienced earlier in the year despite lower market demand for ethylene in 2011 industry margins for ethylene expanded as benchmark average sales prices increased more than the benchmark weighted average cost of ethylene production market demand for polyolefins was lower in 2011 compared to 2010 

despite a lower second half of 2011 operating results in 2011 for the op—eai segment reflected higher product margins for ethylene and especially butadiene and higher sales volumes across most products compared to 2010 segment results in 2011 also benefited from the continued strong performance of our joint ventures and our pp compounding business results for the 2010 successor period include the negative impact of a charge related to a change in estimate associated with a dispute over environmental indemnity while 2011 results include charges associated with activities to reorganize certain functional organizations and for increased environmental liabilities at our wesseling germany site see “results of operationscost of sales” 

2010 versus 2009 —market demand in europe was generally higher in 2010 compared to 2009 as planned and unplanned outages resulted in reduced supply and higher operating results in the second and third quarters of 2010 ethylene margins expanded as benchmark average sales prices increased more than the benchmark weighted 

  

average cost of ethylene production global polyolefin markets also improved in 2010 compared to 2009 the improvement in polypropylene and ldpe reflected tight supply conditions amid planned and unplanned industry outages throughout 2010 

operating results for the 2010 periods reflected higher product margins for both olefins and polyolefins higher sales volumes for pp compounds and polypropylene in 2010 compared to 2009 reflect higher demand primarily from the automotive industry operating results for the successor period also reflected the impacts of freshstart accounting including the benefit of lower depreciation and amortization expense related to the writedown of segment assets see “results of operations – cost of sales” 

ethylene raw materials —in europe heavy liquids are the primary raw materials for our ethylene production 

the following table shows the average west europe benchmark prices for brent crude oil for the applicable periods as well as benchmark western europe prices for ethylene and propylene which we produce and consume internally or purchase from unrelated suppliers and certain polyethylene and polypropylene products 

 

 the following table sets forth the op—eai segment’s sales and other operating revenues operating income income from equity investments and selected product production and sales volumes 

 

   

revenues —revenues for 2011 increased by 2626 million or 20 compared to revenues for 2010 and revenues for 2010 increased by 3433 million or 37 compared to revenues for 2009 

the increase in 2011 revenues compared to 2010 was due to higher average product sales prices which were mainly driven by higher raw material costs sales volumes in 2011 decreased slightly as a decline in polypropylene sales was offset by increases in other product areas but sales volumes in the second half of 2011 were significantly lower than in the first half of the year overall the change in 2011 sales volumes did not have a material impact on revenues higher average product sales prices across most products particularly ethylene butadiene polyethylene and polypropylene were responsible for a 25 increase in 2010 revenues compared to 2009 the remaining 12 increase was due to the effect of higher sales volumes particularly polypropylene including catalloy and pp compounds 

operating income —operating results decreased 51 million in 2011 compared to 2010 operating results for 2011 include the impact of charges associated with activities to reorganize certain functional organizations and for increased environmental liabilities at our wesseling germany site operating results for the successor period in 2010 were negatively impacted by a charge associated with a change in estimate that arose during the third quarter 2010 over an environmental indemnity apart from the items discussed above results for the underlying operations in 2011 and 2010 were comparable 

business results in 2011 primarily reflected higher product margins for butadiene ethylene and to a lesser extent pp compounds and the effect of slightly higher ethylene sales volumes these improvements were substantially offset by lower product margins for polypropylene and polyethylene reflecting higher monomer prices compared to those experienced in 2010 and higher freight and distribution and other costs the strength in butadiene margins reflects strong global demand coupled with constrained supply as a result of a preference for ngl olefins feedstocks which produce less butadiene than liquid feedstocks in north america 

operating results increased 528 million in 2010 compared to 2009 underlying operating results were higher in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily as a result of higher product margins for ethylene butadiene polypropylene and polyethylene mainly ldpe fixed costs were also higher in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting costs related to our maintenance program and the startup of the polymers plant in münchmünster germany operating results for 2010 were negatively impacted by a 35 million charge associated with the change in estimate described above lower depreciation and amortization expense of 62 million in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily a result of our writedown of property plant and equipment associated with the revaluation of our assets in freshstart accounting 

income loss from equity investments —income from equity investments increased 20 million in 2011 compared to 2010 and increased 320 million from 2010 to 2009 the increase in equity income in 2011 primarily reflects the addition of capacity at our hmc joint venture in late 2010 partially offset by lower results for our joint venture located in poland we received dividends of 181 million and 40 million from our equity investments in 2011 and 2010 respectively income in 2009 reflected aftertax impairments of 228 million related to certain joint ventures and was as a result of weak current and projected market conditions at the time 

fourth quarter 2011 versus third quarter 2011 —an operating loss of 55 million was incurred in the fourth quarter compared to operating income of 144 million in the third quarter the 199 million decrease in operating results in the fourth quarter is primarily attributable to lower product margins and the effect of lower sales volumes across all businesses except for pp compounding softness in the european market during the fourth quarter 2011 was reflected in a decrease in product margins for olefins and in some reduction of the strong margins previously realized for butadiene fourth quarter operating results for the polyolefins businesses primarily reflected lower polyethylene margins the overall performance of the pp compounding and catalloy businesses remain strong despite a slight decrease in fourth quarter results compared to the third quarter 

intermediates and derivatives segment 

2011 versus 2010 —the demand for intermediates  derivatives products remained strong in the first nine months of 2011 significant scheduled maintenance turnarounds at two facilities commenced at the end of the third quarter 2011 and continued into the fourth quarter as the facilities returned to full operations in the fourth quarter 

  

demand eroded particularly in europe the decrease in demand reflected typical seasonal declines as well as a weak start to the winter aircraft deicing season id segment results for 2011 reflected higher margins in most product areas especially in butanediol “bdo” acetyls isobutylenes and in eo and derivatives operating results for 2011 reflected the impacts of freshstart accounting including the benefit of lower depreciation and amortization expense for 2011 related to the writedown of segment assets the 2010 successor period includes the negative impact of a noncash charge to adjust inventory to market value see “results of operations—cost of sales” operating results for 2010 also included the operations of our flavors and fragrances business that was sold in december 2010 

2010 versus 2009 —market demand for id products improved in 2010 primarily due to the recovery of the automotive industry and planned and unplanned industry outages during 2010 which tightened industry supply demand in the intermediates market returned to at or above prerecession levels in 2010 

operating results for 2010 primarily reflected higher sales volumes across most products compared to 2009 the propylene oxide business benefited from planned and unplanned competitor downtime in the first half of 2010 as the market for durable goods enduses strengthened operating results for the successor periods reflected the impacts of freshstart accounting including a noncash charge in the second quarter 2010 to adjust inventory to market value that was offset by the benefit of lower depreciation and amortization expense related to the writedown of segment assets see “results of operations—cost of sales” 

the following table sets forth the id segment’s sales and other operating revenues operating income income from equity investments and selected product sales volumes 

 

 revenues —revenues for 2011 increased 913 million or 16 compared to 2010 reflecting higher average sales prices across all businesses and the effect of higher sales volumes for eo eg and styrene which more than offset declines in volumes for po  derivatives acetyls and isobutylenes increased demand in the asian automotive and polyester markets and the effect of competitor outages on supply were partially responsible for the higher average sales prices in 2011 the sales volumes changes reflected the effects of the scheduled maintenance turnarounds at two of our facilities in the fourth quarter 2011 higher production from the eoeg facility in a strong global market for most of the year and the year end slowdown experienced primarily in europe the higher average sales prices resulted in a revenue increase in 2011 of 16 while higher sales volumes resulted in a revenue increase of 3 revenues of our flavors and fragrance chemicals business which was sold in december 2010 comprised 3 of total revenues in 2010 

revenues for 2010 increased 1796 million or 48 compared to revenues for 2009 the increase in revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 reflected increased demand in 2010 leading to higher sales volumes and higher average sales prices across most products particularly po bdo pg tba and styrene the higher average product sales 

  

prices were responsible for a 28 revenue increase higher sales volumes for all but eo and eg were responsible for the remaining 20 increase in revenues eo and eg sales volumes were lower in 2010 due to planned and unplanned maintenance activities during the latter half of 2010 

operating income —operating results increased 193 million in 2011 compared to 2010 the increase in operating results primarily reflected higher product margins across all business products especially in po derivatives improved automotive and other durable goods demand and competitor outages contributed to favorable supplydemand fundamentals as prices outpaced increased raw material costs operating results in 2011 benefited from lower depreciation and amortization expense of 30 million compared to 2010 primarily due to the writedown of property plant and equipment associated with the revaluation of our assets in freshstart accounting operating results for 2010 also included the results of the flavors  fragrance chemicals business which was sold in december 2010 the operating results for the 2010 successor period were negatively impacted by an 8 million noncash charge to adjust inventory at december 31 2010 to market which was lower than the value at april 30 2010 applied during freshstart accounting 

operating results which increased 419 million in 2010 compared to 2009 include the noncash charge to adjust inventory described above lower depreciation and amortization expense of 104 million in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily the result of our writedown of property plant and equipment associated with the revaluation of our assets in freshstart accounting the remaining increases in 2010 primarily reflected the favorable effect of significantly higher sales volumes for po and po derivatives tba and styrene lower product margins for styrene and tba and derivatives more than offset higher product margins for acetyls eo and eg 

fourth quarter 2011 versus third quarter 2011 —operating income was 134 million in the fourth quarter compared to 259 million in the third quarter fourth quarter results reflect a decrease in demand as economic conditions in europe weakened and unseasonably warm weather conditions reduced demand for aircraft deicing products these fundamentals combined with scheduled maintenance turnarounds contributed to the lower fourth quarter 2011 volumes for the po acetyls and tba and intermediates businesses 

refining and oxyfuels segment 

2011 versus 2010 —benchmark us heavy crude refining margins despite declining significantly in the fourth quarter were higher in 2011 as a result of significant discounts for heavy crude oil and increased gasoline and distillate spreads over crude oil for much of the year european refining margins were challenged by industry overcapacity and the loss of libyan crude oil supply oxyfuels margins in 2011 improved compared to 2010 due to higher gasoline prices relative to the cost of natural gasbased raw material costs 

segment operating results were higher in 2011 compared to 2010 even with charges of 136 million primarily related to the anticipated cost of the social plan related to the suspension of operations at our berre refinery and significantly lower refining margins in the fourth quarter the higher 2011 results primarily reflected the effect of higher crude oil refining margins higher oxyfuels margins and increased crude runs at the houston refinery compared to 2010 crude processing rates at the houston refinery were higher in 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010 as a result of unplanned outages during 2010 including the crude unit fire in may 2010 crude processing rates remained reduced at the berre in response to continued poor market conditions and margins oxyfuels results in 2011 were higher compared to 2010 operating results for 2011 and the successor period in 2010 reflect the impacts of freshstart accounting including the benefit of lower depreciation and amortization expense related to the writedown of segment assets 

2010 versus 2009 —in 2010 compared to 2009 benchmark heavy crude refining margins averaged higher primarily due to an increase in the differential between the cost of heavy and light crude oil 

operating results in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily reflected higher benchmark refining margins and lower crude processing rates at the houston refinery crude processing rates for the houston refinery reflected the effects of a crude unit fire sulfur recovery constraints and unplanned outages while the berre refinery crude processing rates were negatively affected by national strikes in france during the fourth quarter 2010 oxyfuels results were lower in 2010 operating results for the successor period reflected the impacts of freshstart accounting including 

  

noncash charges in the second and third quarters of 2010 to adjust inventory to market value all of which was recovered in the fourth quarter 2010 and the benefit of lower depreciation and amortization expense related to the writedown of segment assets see “results of operations—cost of sales” 

the following table sets forth the refining and oxyfuels segment’s sales and other operating revenues operating income and sales volumes for certain gasoline blending components for the applicable periods in addition the table shows market refining margins for the us and europe and mtbe margins in northwest europe “nwe” in the us “lls” or light louisiana sweet and “wti” or west texas intermediate are light crude oils while “maya” is a heavy crude oil in europe “urals – 4121” is a measure of west european refining margins 

 

  

 revenues —revenues increased 5664 million or 38 in 2011 compared to 2010 and increased 2991 million or 25 from 2009 to 2010 the increase in revenues in 2011 was primarily due to higher average sales prices and the effect of higher refining sales volumes at our houston refinery as well as higher oxyfuels margins these increases were partially offset by lower oxyfuels sales volumes higher average sales prices and higher sales volumes were responsible for revenue increases of 29 and 9 respectively houston refinery crude processing rates were 11 higher compared to 2010 which was negatively impacted by a crude unit fire during the second quarter sulfur constraints unplanned coker unit outages and a supply disruption from a third party utility supplier crude processing rates for the berre refinery were 7 lower in 2011 primarily as a result of management’s decision to reduce crude processing rates in response to poor market conditions and labor actions associated with the berre refinery 

  

higher average sales prices at the houston and berre refineries in 2010 were responsible for a 30 increase in revenues compared to 2009 lower crude processing rates in 2010 decreased revenues by 5 compared to 2009 crude processing rates for the houston refinery were 3 lower compared to 2009 as a result of a may 2010 crude unit fire and other planned and unplanned outages during 2010 crude processing rates for the berre refinery were 2 higher in 2010 compared to 2009 despite several planned and unplanned outages 

operating income loss —operating results increased 576 million in 2011 compared to 2010 the improvement in the underlying operations primarily reflects higher refining margins at the houston refinery as indicated by the increase in the maya 211 benchmark margin and higher oxyfuels margins financial performance of the houston refining business was favorably impacted by purchasing crude oils at discounts versus the maya reference price for heavy crude oil margins for oxyfuels products reflect the effect of higher spreads between the prices of gasoline and butane a key raw material operating results for 2011 include charges of 136 million associated with the estimated cost of the social plan related to suspension of operations at our berre refinery and 31 million of charges primarily associated with the impairment of assets at the berre refinery the effect of these charges in 2011 was partially offset by benefits totaling 49 million including an insurance recovery associated with the misconduct of a former employee and a settlement related to the 2008 crane incident at our houston refinery operating results for 2011 also benefited from lower depreciation expense of 90 million compared to the same 2010 period as a result of the application of freshstart accounting and the revaluation of our assets operating results for 2010 were negatively impacted by a 21 million charge associated with a change in estimate related to a dispute over environmental indemnity the impairment of assets related to the berre refinery and a crude unit fire at the houston refinery in may 2010 resulting in lost production and 14 million of cash costs 

operating results which increased 499 million in 2010 compared to 2009 were negatively impacted by the 21 million charge associated with the change in estimate described above charges of 25 million for impairment of assets related to the berre refinery and by a crude unit fire at the houston refinery in may 2010 resulting in lost production and 14 million in cash costs operating results for 2009 included the benefit of 50 million from the settlement of hedging activity at the houston refinery related to distillates lower depreciation and amortization expense of 269 million in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily the result of the writedown of property plant and equipment associated with the revaluation of our assets in freshstart accounting apart from the effects of the items listed above increases in operating results for 2010 were primarily due to higher refining margins especially at the houston refinery partially offset by lower product margins for oxyfuels the decreased oxyfuels margins seen in 2010 were primarily due to the normalization of margins in 2010 compared to the exceptional margins achieved in 2009 

fourth quarter 2011 versus third quarter 2011 —an operating loss of 196 million was incurred in the fourth quarter compared to operating income of 454 million in the third quarter operating results in the fourth quarter 2011 included 136 million of charges primarily related to the suspension of operations at our berre refinery as described above refining margins in the third quarter included the benefit of purchasing crude oils at discounts versus the maya reference price for heavy crude oil apart from these items the remaining decrease in fourth quarter operating results reflects significantly lower refining margins particularly at the houston refinery and to a lesser extent lower volumes across all businesses the lower refining margins at the houston refinery are reflective of the significant decrease in the maya 211 benchmark margin during the fourth quarter oxyfuels margins were lower in the fourth quarter due to a decrease in the spread between butane and gasoline as demand for high octane clean gasoline components followed seasonal demand patterns this decrease in oxyfuels margins was less severe than the seasonal winter decline usually experienced in the fourth quarter crude processing rates for the houston refinery which were impacted by planned maintenance outages during the fourth quarter were 3 lower compared to the third quarter crude processing rates in the fourth quarter for the berre refinery were 23 lower compared to the third quarter as a result of management’s decision to reduce rates in response to poor market conditions and margins and a disruption related to a strike following the announcement of the contemplated closing of the refinery 

  

technology segment 

2011 versus 2010 —results reflected higher research and development costs primarily related to charges for the impairment of an rd project in europe and the relocation of an rd facility and lower licensing and services revenue in 2011 compared to 2010 operating results for the catalyst business were higher in 2011 compared to 2010 

2010 versus 2009 —results in 2010 were negatively impacted by lower licensing revenue reflecting a slowdown in new polyolefin projects as a consequence of the economic crisis beginning late in the fourth quarter 2008 higher sales volumes for catalysts partially offset the results for process licenses 

the following table sets forth the technology segment’s sales and other operating revenues and operating income 

 

 revenues— revenues were comparable in 2011 and 2010 catalyst sales volumes and prices were essentially the same in both years the recognition of revenue on process licenses issued in prior periods was lower in 2011 and resulted in a 2 decrease in revenues 

revenues decreased 33 million or 6 from 2009 to 2010 the recognition of revenue on process licenses issued in prior periods decreased in 2010 and was responsible for decreases in revenues of 15 catalyst sales volumes increased revenues by 9 

operating income —operating income was comparable in 2011 and 2010 in 2011 lower revenue recognized from process licenses issued in prior years and higher rd costs in 2011 offset the effects of higher operating results for catalysts operating income in both periods reflected the impact of a slowdown in new polyolefin projects that stemmed from the economic crisis in late 2008 higher rd costs include 19 million of charges primarily related to the impairment of an rd project in europe and charges totaling 16 million for employee severance and asset retirement obligations related to an rd facility that is being relocated 

operating income decreased 102 million from 2009 to 2010 results in 2010 were negatively affected by an 8 million charge associated with a change in estimate related to a dispute that arose during the third quarter 2010 over an environmental indemnity and by a 17 million charge related to the sale in 2010 of higher cost inventory the remaining decrease in operating income in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily the result of lower licensing revenue compared to 2009 these decreases in 2010 operating results were only partly offset by the effect of increased catalyst sales volumes in 2010 operating income in 2009 also included the benefit of a government subsidy recognized as a reduction of rd expense 

fourth quarter 2011 versus third quarter 2011 —operating income was 11 million in the fourth quarter compared to 7 million in the third quarter the increase in fourth quarter operating results was primarily due to higher revenue recognized from process licenses issued in prior years and lower rd costs partially offset by the effect of lower operating results for catalysts in the fourth quarter operating results for the third quarter included 19 million of charges related to the impairment of an rd project in europe 

  

financial condition 

operating investing and financing activities of continuing operations which are discussed below are presented in the following table 

 

 operating activities —cash of 2869 million provided in 2011 primarily reflected an increase in earnings and higher distributions from our joint ventures partially offset by an increase in cash used by the main components of working capital and payments totaling 1699 million related to company contributions to our pension plans tax payments premiums and other fees related to prepayments of debt and a litigation settlement 

the main components of working capital used cash of 118 million in 2011 compared to 456 million in 2010 the increase in these working capital components during 2011 reflects increases of 89 million and 732 million respectively in accounts receivable and inventories partially offset by a 703 million increase in accounts payable the increases in both accounts receivable and accounts payable reflect the effect of increasing prices over the period the increase in inventories reflects the effect of higher prices and increased volumes especially in the op—americas business segment as we built inventory in preparation for a major first quarter 2012 turnaround 

cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter 2011 decreased significantly from the cash provided in the second and third quarters of 2011 the 91 million of cash provided in the fourth quarter reflects 476 million of cash provided by the main components of working capital and higher distributions from our joint ventures all of which was substantially offset by the fourth quarter operating loss and payments totaling 1118 million related to company contributions to our pension plans tax payments premiums and other fees related to prepayment of debt and a litigation settlement our fourth quarter operating loss included after tax charges totaling 448 million including 279 million related to the premiums and other charges associated with our prepayment of debt and 136 million primarily associated with the suspension of operations at the berre refinery 

the main components of working capital which provided cash of 476 million in the fourth quarter 2011 reflects decreases of 193 million in accounts receivable 132 million in inventories and 151 million in accounts payable the decrease in accounts receivable reflects the effect of lower sales particularly in our olefins and polyolefins businesses the decrease in inventories in the fourth quarter primarily reflected reductions in crude inventories at our berre refinery which ceased operations in early january 2012 and lower inventories for our id business segment as the inventory build in the third quarter in preparation for fourth quarter turnarounds was consumed the decrease in accounts payable primarily reflected the reduction in crude purchases associated with the suspension of operations at the berre refinery 

cash provided in the combined successor and predecessor periods of 2010 primarily reflected an increase in earnings offset by payments for reorganization items claims under the plan of reorganization and certain annual payments relating to sales rebates employee bonuses property taxes and insurance premiums the use of cash in 2009 primarily reflected a 573 million increase in cash used by the main components of working capital – accounts receivable and inventory net of accounts payable – and 329 million of vendor prepayments that were required by certain third parties as a result of lyondellbasell af’s chapter 11 filing 

  

in 2010 the main components of working capital – accounts receivable and inventory net of accounts payable used cash of 456 million compared to 573 million in 2009 the increase in these components of working capital during 2010 reflected a 702 million increase in accounts receivable due to higher average sales prices and higher sales volumes and a 395 million increase in inventory partially offset by a 641 million increase in accounts payable due to the higher costs and volumes of feedstocks and more favorable payment terms 

the increase in cash used by the main components of working capital in 2009 primarily reflected a 503 million repayment that was required in connection with the termination of an accounts receivable securitization program in early 2009 

investing activities —cash used in investing activities in 2011 primarily reflects capital expenditures of 1050 million and a 42 million increase in restricted cash partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets capital expenditures in 2011 include the july 2011 purchase of a pipeline for 73 million the 71 million of proceeds include 57 million related to the sale of surplus precious metals associated with a catalyst for our eo and derivatives business the increase in restricted cash is primarily related to the issuance of letters of credit which are collateralized by cash 

cash used in investing activities in 2010 included 692 million of capital expenditures partially offset by proceeds of 154 million from the sale of our flavors  fragrance chemicals business in december 2010 and 12 million in proceeds from a money market fund that had suspended rights to redemption in 2008 

the cash used in 2009 primarily included 779 million of capital expenditures partially offset by proceeds of 120 million from insurance claims 20 million from sales of assets and 23 million from a net reduction of shortterm investments the cash provided by insurance claims related to damages sustained in 2005 at the polymers plant in münchsmünster germany 

the following table summarizes capital expenditures anticipated for 2012 and actual capital expenditures for the periods from 2009 through 2011 

 

 the capital expenditures presented in the table above exclude costs of major periodic maintenance and repair activities including turnarounds and catalyst recharges of 71 million and 39 million in the predecessor periods of 2010 and 2009 respectively

we made net payments totaling 398 million in the successor period of 2010 under the european securitization facility which included the entire outstanding balance in october 2010 we also made net payments of 14 million under our accounts receivable factoring facility during the successor period of 2010 

as part of our emergence from bankruptcy we received gross proceeds of 2800 million on april 30 2010 in connection with the issuance of shares in a rights offering and paid 86 million of fees including 70 million of fees to equity backstop providers on april 30 2010 we also received net proceeds of 3242 million from the issuance of new debt by our subsidiary lyondell chemical including senior secured notes in the amounts of 2250 million and €375 million 497 million and from proceeds of the senior term loan facility of 495 million and paid related fees of 72 million 

proceeds from the rights offering and the senior notes along with borrowings under the senior term loan facility and the amended and restated european securitization facility were used to repay outstanding amounts of 3152 million under our dip financing arrangement and to pay a 195 million exit fee required under the arrangement we also paid fees totaling 92 million in connection with our new us abl facility and amended and restated european securitization facility predecessor debt classified as liabilities subject to compromise immediately prior to emergence from bankruptcy was discharged pursuant to the plan of reorganization see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements 

apart from the payments reflected above during the 2010 predecessor period we made payments totaling 25 million under other financing arrangements and had a net increase in borrowings of 47 million under the european securitization facility

the chapter 11 filing in 2009 constituted a termination event under the assetbased credit facilities in the us and lyondellbasell af used 880 million of the net proceeds under the dip financing arrangement to repay 766 million and 114 million outstanding under the previous inventorybased credit facility and the north american accounts receivable securitization program respectively as noted under operating activities 

  

lyondellbasell af also used 503 million to repurchase outstanding accounts receivable sold under its previous 1150 million receivables securitization facility in addition lyondellbasell af repaid a 100 million demand note related to emergency postpetition funding in 2009 lyondellbasell af made net repayments totaling 201 million under its european receivables securitization program which was amended and restated in march 2009 lyondellbasell af repaid 45 million 70 million australian dollars outstanding under an australian term loan and 11 million of other loans 

liquidity and capital resources —as of december 31 2011 we had unrestricted cash of 1065 million in addition we had total unused availability under our credit facilities of 2183 million at december 31 2011 which included the following 

 

  

 in december 2011 lyondell chemical settled a lawsuit in which basf had obtained a judgment in 2007 of approximately 200 million lyondell appealed the judgment and posted an appeal bond which is collateralized by a 200 million letter of credit and is included in the 262 million of letters of credit issued under our us abl facility the settlement was approved by the bankruptcy court on january 18 2012 and we expect the appeal bond to be dissolved sometime in the first quarter of 2012 upon final dissolution of the bond and the return and cancellation of the original letter of credit our liquidity will increase by 200 million 

we have receivables outstanding of €172 million 223 million related to value added tax “vat” in italy in the first quarter 2010 italy implemented a reverse change rule under which nondomestic companies may not collect vat on sales to domestic companies but must submit vat on purchases from domestic companies as a result the balance of vat receivables due from italy has increased during 2011 we fully expect to collect all amounts owed to us 

an offering to sell our berre refinery in france which commenced in may 2011 did not result in any offers to purchase as a result in september 2011 we announced our intention to initiate consultations with works councils regarding a contemplated closure of the refinery which would affect approximately 370 employees on january 4 2012 refinery operations were suspended the suspension of operations was in accordance with an agreement executed in the fourth quarter by our french entities and union representatives addressing the procedures by which suspension of refinery operations and the consultations would be governed consultations with the relevant works councils are in progress 

the company has recorded a charge of 136 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 primarily related to the estimated cost of the social plan and as a result of inventory writedowns final costs to be incurred are contingent on completion of the consultations the company expects to incur additional costs in connection with the cessation of operations the company does not believe any such additional costs will be material to its results of operations 

in addition to the letters of credit issued under the us abl facility we also have outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees totaling 48 million which are collateralized by cash such cash is included in the 53 million of restricted cash reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2011 

at december 31 2011 we had total debt including current maturities of 4032 million 

we may use cash on hand cash from operating activities and proceeds from asset divestitures to repay debt which may include additional purchases of our outstanding bonds in the open market or otherwise we also plan to finance our ongoing working capital capital expenditures debt service and other funding requirements through our future financial and operating performance which could be affected by general economic financial competitive 

  

legislative regulatory business and other factors many of which are beyond our control to the extent our cash balances and results of operations support the payment of dividends we also intend to declare and pay interim dividends we believe that our cash cash from operating activities and proceeds from our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due 

amendments —in november 2011 we obtained amendments to the indentures governing our 8 senior secured notes and 11 senior secured notes these amendments include the release of all collateral securing the notes and modification of other provisions relating to restrictive covenants 

in november 2011 an amendment to our european receivables securitization program resulted in a reduced pricing structure 

in june 2011 we obtained an amendment to our us abl facility to among other things i increase the facility to 2 billion ii extend the maturity date to june 2016 iii reduce the applicable margin and commitment fee and iv amend certain covenants and conditions to provide additional flexibility 

contractual and other obligations —the following table summarizes as of december 31 2011 our minimum payments for longterm debt including current maturities shortterm debt and contractual and other obligations for the next five years and thereafter 

 

 total debt —total debt includes our 6 senior notes due 2021 8 us dollar and euro senior notes due 2017 11 senior notes due 2018 81 guaranteed notes due 2027 the “2027 notes” and various nonus loans see note 12 for a discussion of covenant requirements under the credit facilities and indentures and additional information regarding our debt facilities 

interest —our debt and related party debt agreements contain provisions for the payment of monthly quarterly or semiannual interest at a stated rate of interest over the term of the debt 

pension benefits —we maintain several defined benefit pension plans as described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2011 the projected benefit obligation for our pension plans 

  

exceeded the fair value of plan assets by 1079 million subject to future actuarial gains and losses as well as actual asset earnings we together with our consolidated subsidiaries will be required to fund the 1079 million with interest in future years we contributed 526 million and 99 million to our pension plans in 2011 and 2010 respectively and lyondellbasell af made contributions to the plans of 52 million in 2009 estimates of pension benefit payments through 2016 are included in the table above 

other postretirement benefits —we provide other postretirement benefits primarily medical benefits to eligible participants as described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements we pay other unfunded postretirement benefits as incurred estimates of other postretirement benefit payments through 2016 are included in the table above 

advances from customers —we are obligated to deliver product primarily at costbased prices in connection with longterm sales agreements under which our predecessor received advances from customers in prior years these advances are treated as deferred revenue and will be amortized to earnings as product is delivered over the remaining terms of the respective contracts which primarily range from 4 to 8 years the unamortized longterm portion of such advances totaled 146 million as of december 31 2011 

other —other primarily consists of accruals for environmental remediation costs obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and anticipated asset retirement obligations see “critical accounting policies” below for a discussion of obligations for environmental remediation costs 

deferred income taxes —the scheduled settlement of the deferred tax liabilities shown in the table is based on the scheduled reversal of the underlying temporary differences actual cash tax payments will vary depending upon future taxable income 

purchase obligations —we are party to various obligations to purchase products and services principally for raw materials utilities and industrial gases these commitments are designed to assure sources of supply and are not expected to be in excess of normal requirements the commitments are segregated into takeorpay contracts and other contracts under the takeorpay contracts we are obligated to make minimum payments whether or not we take the product or service other contracts include contracts that specify minimum quantities however in the event that we do not take the contractual minimum we are only obligated for any resulting economic loss suffered by the vendor the payments shown for the other contracts assume that minimum quantities are purchased for contracts with variable pricing terms the minimum payments reflect the contract price at december 31 2011 

operating leases —we lease various facilities and equipment under noncancelable lease arrangements for various periods see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for related lease disclosures 

related party transactions 

we have related party transactions with certain of our major shareholders and their affiliates and our joint venture partners we believe that such transactions are effected on terms substantially no more or less favorable than those that would have been agreed upon by unrelated parties on an arm’s length basis 

lyondellbasell af had related party transactions with its equity investees and its affiliates as well as a member of its supervisory board see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in addition prior to the emergence date lyondellbasell af had related party transactions with access industries 

critical accounting policies 

management applies those accounting policies that it believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the us see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements our more critical accounting policies include those related to the valuation of inventory longlived assets the valuation of goodwill accruals for longterm employee benefit costs such as pension and other 

  

postretirement costs liabilities for anticipated expenditures to comply with environmental regulations and accruals for taxes based on income inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management management periodically updates its estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment 

inventory —lyondellbasell nv adopted the lifo method of accounting for inventory upon implementation of freshstart accounting the price of crude oil and natural gas is subject to many factors including changes in economic conditions the fluctuation in the price of crude oil and natural gas from period to period may result in the recognition of charges to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in periods of falling prices and the reversal of those charges in subsequent periods as market prices recover accordingly our cost of sales and results of operations may be affected by such fluctuations in conjunction with the implementation of freshstart accounting on april 30 2010 the company recorded its inventory which was primarily crudeoil derived at fair value 

following the revaluation of our inventory to fair value on april 30 2010 we recorded a net noncash charge of 42 million to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market at december 31 2010 no lower of cost or market charges were required in 2011 

longlived assets —with respect to longlived assets which primarily include property plant and equipment and intangible assets key assumptions included the estimates of the asset fair values and useful lives at the emergence date and the recoverability of carrying values of fixed assets and other intangible assets as well as the existence of any obligations associated with the retirement of fixed assets such estimates could be significantly modified andor the carrying values of the assets could be impaired by such factors as new technological developments new chemical industry entrants with significant raw material or other cost advantages uncertainties associated with the european us and world economies the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries and uncertainties associated with regulatory governmental actions 

earnings in 2011 and the 2010 successor period included pretax charges of 31 million and 28 million primarily related to impairment of the carrying value of capital additions at our berre refinery following an analysis of its discounted cash flow projections during the year ended december 31 2011 and the eight months ended december 31 2010 we recognized impairments of 19 million and 3 million respectively related to certain inprocess research and development projects which were abandoned 

predecessor earnings for 2009 included pretax impairment charges of 17 million primarily related to the impairment of lyondellbasell af’s emissions allowances that are subject to reallocation to other industry participants under a proposed regulation by the texas commission on environmental quality as part of its reorganization lyondellbasell af also recognized charges totaling 679 million including 624 million for the write off of the carrying value and related assets of its chocolate bayou olefins facility near alvin texas and 55 million for the write off of its ethylene glycol facility in beaumont texas 

for purposes of recognition and measurement of the abovenoted impairments longlived assets were grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows were largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

the estimated useful lives of longlived assets range from 3 to 30 years depreciation and amortization of these assets including amortization of deferred turnaround costs under the straightline method over their estimated useful lives totaled 931 million in 2011 if the useful lives of the assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated depreciation and amortization charges would be accelerated over the revised useful life 

goodwill —goodwill of 585 million at december 31 2011 represents the tax effect of the differences between the tax and book bases of the company’s assets and liabilities resulting from the company’s revaluation of those assets and liabilities to fair value in connection with the company’s emergence from bankruptcy and adoption of freshstart accounting lyondellbasell nv evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value 

  

in accordance with the recently issued asu no 201108 intangibles—goodwill and other topic 350—testing goodwill for impairment  we used a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment in december 2011 we chose to adopt this asu early and performed a qualitative assessment and determined that is was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were not less than their carrying values and it was not necessary to perform the currently prescribed twostep goodwill impairment test the recoverability of our goodwill is dependent upon the discounted estimated future operating results associated with our reporting units which could change significantly based upon business performance or other factors 

longterm employee benefit costs —the costs to lyondellbasell nv of longterm employee benefits particularly pension and other postretirement medical and life insurance benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is management’s responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent its best estimates of the future effects of those uncertainties it also is management’s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 

the current benefit service costs as well as the existing liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis the discount rate is a current rate related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled lyondellbasell nv’s assumed discount rate is based on published average rates for highquality aa rating tenyear fixed income securities for the purpose of measuring the benefit obligations at december 31 2011 lyondellbasell nv used a weighted average discount rate of 407 for the us plans which reflects the different terms of the related benefit obligations the weighted average discount rate used to measure obligations for nonus plans at december 31 2011 was 483 reflecting market interest rates the discount rates in effect at december 31 2011 will be used to measure net periodic benefit cost during 2012 

the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of other postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits as of december 31 2011 the assumed rate of increase for our us plans was 82 decreasing to 45 in 2027 and thereafter a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate assumption would have no significant effect on either the benefit liability or the net periodic cost due to limits on lyondellbasell nv’s maximum contribution level under the medical plan 

the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption investment returns that are recognized currently in net income represent the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets applied to a marketrelated value of plan assets which for lyondellbasell nv is defined as the market value of assets the expected rate of return on plan assets is a longer term rate and is expected to change less frequently than the current assumed discount rate reflecting longterm market expectations rather than current fluctuations in market conditions 

the weighted average expected longterm rate of return on us and nonus plan assets of 800 and 621 respectively is based on the average level of earnings that its independent pension investment advisor had advised could be expected to be earned over time the expectation is based on an asset allocation that varies by region the asset allocations are summarized in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements the actual returns in 2011 were a loss of 076 for us plan assets and a gain of 382 for non us plan assets 

the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets management’s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 

net periodic pension cost recognized each year includes the expected asset earnings rather than the actual earnings or loss this unrecognized amount to the extent it exceeds 10 of the projected benefit obligation for the respective plan is recognized as additional net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service period of the participants in each plan 

  

additional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

liabilities for environmental remediation costs —environmental remediation liabilities were recorded at fair value at emergence additional liabilities recorded subsequent to emergence for anticipated expenditures related to investigation and remediation of contaminated sites which include current and former plant sites and other remediation sites are accrued when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated only ongoing operating and monitoring costs the timing of which can be determined with reasonable certainty are discounted to present value future legal costs associated with such matters which generally are not estimable are not included in these liabilities 

as of december 31 2011 lyondellbasell nv’s accrued liability for future environmental remediation costs at current and former plant sites and other remediation sites totaled 120 million the liabilities for individual sites range from less than 1 million to 23 million and remediation expenditures are expected to occur over a number of years and not to be concentrated in any single year in the opinion of management it is reasonably possible that losses in excess of the liabilities recorded for environmental remediation may have been incurred however we cannot estimate any amount or range of such possible additional losses new information about sites new technology or future developments such as involvement in investigations by regulatory agencies could require lyondellbasell nv to reassess potential exposure related to environmental matters see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of environmental remediation matters 

accruals for taxes based on income —the determination of our provision for income taxes and the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities is subject to management’s estimates and judgments due to the complexity of the tax laws and regulations in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of these complex laws and regulations 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 

we recognize future tax benefits to the extent that the realization of these benefits is more likely than not our current provision for income taxes was impacted significantly by the initial recognition of valuation allowances related to net deferred assets in certain nonus jurisdictions further changes to these valuation allowances may impact our future provision for income taxes which will include no tax benefit with respect to losses incurred and no tax expense with respect to income generated in these countries until the respective valuation allowance is eliminated

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of lyondellbasell nv’s management of commodity price risk foreign currency exposure and interest rate risk through its use of derivative instruments and hedging activities 

the company’s ability to engage in risk mitigation activities through the use of derivative transactions was limited from early 2009 to april 30 2010 as a result of the voluntary filings in 2009 for relief under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code and the associated perceived credit risk 

commodity price risk 

a substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change accordingly product margins and the level of our profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the business cycle we try to protect against such instability through various business strategies these include provisions in sales contracts allowing us to pass on higher raw material costs through timely price increases formula price contracts to transfer or share commodity price risk and increasing the depth and breadth of our product portfolio 

in addition we selectively use commodity swap option and futures contracts with various terms to manage the volatility related to purchases of natural gas and raw materials as well as product sales such contracts are generally limited to durations of one year or less cashflow hedge accounting may be elected for these derivative transactions however in some cases when the duration of a derivative is short hedge accounting is not elected when hedge accounting is not elected the changes in fair value of these instruments will be recorded in earnings when hedge accounting is elected gains and losses on these instruments will be deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” to the extent that the hedge remains effective until the underlying transaction is recognized in earnings market risks created by these derivative instruments and the marktomarket valuations of open positions are monitored by management 

the estimated fair value and notional amounts of our open commodity futures contracts are shown in the table below 

 

  

   

we use value at risk “var” stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes var estimates the maximum potential loss in fair market values given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time using specified confidence levels using sensitivity analysis and hypothetical changes in market prices ranging from 26 to 36 which represents the one year volatility ranges of the underlying products the effect would have been to increase lyondellbasell nv’s net income by less than 1 million the quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account the effects of the underlying operating transactions 

foreign exchange risk 

we manufacture and market our products in a number of countries throughout the world and as a result are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates transactions are entered into in part in currencies other than the applicable functional currency 

a significant portion of our reporting entities use the euro as their functional currency our reporting currency is the us dollar the translation gains or losses that result from the process of translating the euro denominated financial statements to us dollars are deferred in aoci until such time as those assets are realized changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro can therefore have a significant impact on comprehensive income we generally do not attempt to minimize or mitigate the foreign currency risks resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign operations into our reporting currency 

some of our operations enter into transactions denominated in other than their functional currency this results in exposure to foreign currency risk for financial instruments including but not limited to third party and intercompany receivables and payables intercompany loans and third party debt we maintain risk management control systems intended to monitor foreign currency risk attributable to intercompany and third party outstanding foreign currency balances the control systems involve the centralization of foreign currency exposure management offsetting exposures and estimating the expected impacts of changes in foreign currency rates on our earnings we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of our net currency exchange exposures since june 30 2010 our policy has been to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies to minimize exchange gains and losses arising from changes in exchange rates this position is monitored weekly a 10 fluctuation compared to the us dollar in the underlying currencies would result in an additional impact to earnings of no more than 25 million in any reporting period 

for 2011 the 2010 successor and predecessor periods and the year ended december 31 2009 other income loss net in the consolidated statements of income reflected a loss of 17 million a gain of 18 million losses of 258 million and gains of 123 million respectively in net exchange rate gains and losses the 258 million loss in the 2010 predecessor period and the 123 million gain in 2009 were primarily the result of the revaluation of third party debt of certain of our subsidiaries due to changes in the foreign exchange rates in effect during those periods such debt was denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the subsidiaries and was refinanced upon emergence from bankruptcy for forward contracts that economically hedge recognized monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies no hedge accounting is applied changes in the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are reported in the consolidated statements of income and offset the currency exchange results recognized on the assets and liabilities 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to variable rate debt our variable rate debt consists of our 2000 million us assetbased facility and our €450 million receivable securitization facility at december 31 2011 there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

 

corporate structure and overview 

 

lyondellbasell industries nv was incorporated under dutch law by deed of incorporation dated october 15 2009 the company was formed to serve as the new parent holding company for certain subsidiaries of lyondellbasell af sca from january 2009 through april 2010 lyondellbasell af and 93 of its subsidiaries were debtors in jointly administered bankruptcy cases in us bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york as of april 30 2010 the date of emergence from bankruptcy proceedings lyondellbasell af’s equity interests in its indirect subsidiaries terminated and lyondellbasell industries nv now owns and operates directly and indirectly substantially the same business as lyondellbasell af owned and operated prior to emergence from the bankruptcy cases including subsidiaries of lyondellbasell af that were not involved in the bankruptcy cases 

 

our company is the successor to the combination in december 2007 of lyondell chemical company “lyondell chemical” and basell af sca “basell” which created one of the world’s largest private petrochemical companies with significant worldwide scale and leading product positions 

 

we are the world’s third largest independent chemical company based on revenues and an industry leader in many of our product lines we participate in the full petrochemical value chain from refining to specialized end uses of petrochemical products and we believe that our vertically integrated facilities broad product portfolio manufacturing flexibility superior technology base and operational excellence allow us to extract value across the full value chain 

 

segments 

 

as of december 31 2009 we began reporting our results of operations based on five business segments through which our operations are managed our reportable segments include 

 

 1 

 

the following chart sets out our business segments’ key products 

 

 

 

 

  

olefins and polyolefins segments generally 

 

we are a top worldwide producer of ethylene propylene and pe and the world’s largest producer of pp and pp compounds we manage our olefin and polyolefin business in two reportable segments op — americas and op — eai 

 

ethylene is the most significant petrochemical in terms of worldwide production volume and is the key building block for pe and a large number of other chemicals plastics and synthetics the production of ethylene results in coproducts such as propylene butadiene and aromatics which include benzene and toluene ethylene and its coproducts are fundamental to many segments of the economy including the production of consumer products packaging housing and automotive components and other durable and nondurable goods 

 

polyolefins are thermoplastics and comprise approximately twothirds of worldwide thermoplastics demand since their industrial commercialization thermoplastics have found wideranging applications and continue to replace traditional materials such as metal glass paper and wood our products are used in consumer automotive and industrial applications ranging from food and beverage packaging to housewares and construction materials pe is the most widely used thermoplastic measured on a production capacity basis we produce hdpe ldpe lldpe and metallocene linear low density polyethylene pp is the single largest polyolefin product produced worldwide and we produce homopolymer impact copolymer random copolymer and metallocene pp 

we specialize in several specialty product lines pp compounds catalloy process resins and pb1 focusing on specialty polyolefins and compounds that offer a wide range of performance characteristics typical properties of such specialty polyolefins and compounds include impactstiffness balance scratch resistance soft touch and heat scalability end uses include automotive and industrial products and materials pp compounds consist of specialty products produced from blends of polyolefins and additives and are sold mainly to the automotive and home appliances industries 

 

we are the only manufacturer of catalloy process resins which are our proprietary products the catalloy process resins business focuses on specialty polyolefins that offer a wide range of performance characteristics catalloy process resins compete with a number of other materials such as other pp resins flexible pvc ethylene propylene rubber acrylonitrile butadiene styrene “abs” polycarbonate metals and reinforced polyurethanes 

 

sales of ethylene accounted for approximately 3 of our total revenues in 2010 sales of pp accounted for approximately 18 of our total revenues in 2010 sales of pe hdpe ldpe and lldpe collectively accounted for 16 of our total revenues in 2010 

 

olefins and polyolefins — americas segment 

 

overview 

 

our op — americas segment produces and markets olefins polyolefins aromatics specialty products and ethylene coproducts we are the largest producer of light olefins ethylene and propylene and pp and the third largest producer of pe in north america in addition we produce significant quantities of specialty products in 2010 our op — americas segment generated operating revenues of 92 billion excluding intersegment revenue 

 

the following table outlines 

 

  

 3 

 4 

 

 

 

  

see “description of properties” for the locations where we produce the primary products of our op — americas segment annual processing capacity as of december 31 2010 was calculated by estimating the average number of days in a typical year that a production unit of a plant is expected to operate after allowing for downtime for regular maintenance and multiplying that number by an amount equal to the unit’s optimal daily output based on the design raw material mix because the processing capacity of a production unit is an estimated amount actual production volumes may be more or less than the capacities set forth below capacities shown include 100 of the capacity of joint venture facilities 

 

sales  marketing  customers 

 

in 2010 no single external op — americas segment customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues 

 

we currently produce ethylene at five sites in the us our ethylene production in the us generally is consumed internally as a raw material in the production of polymers and other derivatives or is shipped by pipeline to customers in north america we are a net seller of ethylene 

 

we currently produce propylene at six sites in the us which includes production from the houston refinery’s fluid catalytic cracker coproduct stream we use propylene as a raw material for production of po pp and other derivatives the propylene production within the us that is not consumed internally is generally sold under multiyear contracts in north america we are a net seller of propylene 

we have butadiene and aromatics benzene and toluene production capabilities at two sites in the us we generally sell our butadiene under multiyear contracts we use the benzene as a raw material for production of styrene in the us we are a net purchaser of benzene our refining  oxyfuels business uses the toluene to blend into gasoline of the toluene production that is not consumed internally a majority is sold on a spot basis 

 

we at times purchase ethylene propylene benzene and butadiene for resale when necessary to satisfy customer demand for these products above production levels volumes of ethylene propylene benzene and butadiene purchased for resale can vary significantly from period to period however purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profits 

 

in the us most of the ethylene and propylene production of our channelview corpus christi and la porte facilities is shipped via a pipeline system which has connections to numerous us gulf coast consumers this pipeline system some of which is owned and some of which is leased extends from corpus christi to mont belvieu to port arthur texas as well as into the lake charles louisiana area in addition exchange agreements with other ethylene and coproducts producers allow access to customers who are not directly connected to this pipeline system some ethylene is shipped by rail car from clinton iowa to morris illinois and also to customers a pipeline owned and operated by an unrelated party is used to transport ethylene from morris illinois to tuscola illinois and is used as a raw material in the production of ethanol some propylene is shipped by ocean going vessel butadiene benzene toluene and other products are distributed by pipeline rail car truck barge or ocean going vessel 

 

we produce pp at three sites in north america one of which is owned by our mexican joint venture and one site in south america we manufacture pe using a variety of technologies at six sites in the us our pp and pe production is typically sold to an extensive base of established customers under annual contracts or under customary terms and conditions without formal contracts we also sell pp into our pp compounds business which is managed worldwide by our op — eai segment we also have a facility in ohio that produces performance polymer products which include enhanced grades of pe we believe that over a business cycle average selling prices and profit margins for specialty polymers tend to be higher than average selling prices and profit margins for highervolume commodity pes 

 

the majority of our polyolefin products sold in north america are sold through our sales organization we have regional sales offices in various locations throughout the us polyolefins primarily are distributed in north america by rail car or truck 

 

joint venture relationships 

 

the following table describes our op — americas segment’s significant manufacturing joint venture relationships 

 

 

 

 

  

indelpro’s output is marketed by the joint venture indelpro’s annual capacity includes 770 million pounds produced from our spherizone process technology we receive equity distributions and revenues from technology licensing and catalyst sales from the joint venture further we believe the geographic diversification provides benefits to our company 

 

we also have a limited partnership with respect to our laporte texas olefin facility the partnership produces ethylene and propylene our partner’s partnership interest entitles it to 500 million pounds of propylene annually our partnership interest entitles us to receive all remaining ethylene and propylene production as well as other products produced 

raw materials 

 

raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost for the production of ethylene and its coproducts the primary raw materials used are heavy liquids and natural gas liquids “ngls” heavy liquids include crude oilbased naphtha and gas oil as well as condensate a very light crude oil resulting from natural gas production collectively referred to as “heavy liquids” ngls include ethane propane and butane the use of heavy liquid raw materials results in the production of a significant amount of coproducts such as propylene butadiene benzene and toluene as well as gasoline blending components while the use of ngls results in the production of a smaller amount of coproducts 

 

historically facilities using heavy liquids as feedstock have generated higher margins than those using ethane however in recent years ethane has had a cost advantage for use as feedstock based on higher crude oil prices relative to ngls as a result a plant’s flexibility to consume a wide range of raw materials generally will provide an advantage over plants that are restricted in processing capabilities over a number of years we have the capability to process significant quantities of either heavy liquids or ngls we estimate that in the us we can process between 35 and 85 ngls changes in the raw material feedstock will result in variances in production capacities among products we believe our raw material flexibility in the us is a key advantage in the production of ethylene and its coproducts 

 

we source our heavy liquids requirements worldwide via a mix of contractual and spot arrangements spot market purchases are made in order to maintain raw material flexibility and to take advantage of raw material pricing opportunities we purchase ngl requirements via long term and spot contractual arrangements from a variety of sources a portion of the heavy liquids requirements for ethylene production are also obtained from our refining  oxyfuels segment heavy liquids generally are delivered by ship or barge and ngls are generally delivered via pipeline 

 

in north america we also purchase large amounts of natural gas to be used for consumption not as a raw material in our business via marketbased contractual arrangements with a variety of sources 

 

the principal raw materials used by our polyolefin business are ethylene and propylene during 2010 our north american ethylene and propylene production exceeded the north american raw material requirements of the polyolefin business of our op — americas segment however not all raw material requirements for ethylene and propylene in this region are sourced internally our mexican joint venture indelpro receives the majority of its chemical grade and refinery grade propylene needs from pemex the state owned oil company of mexico under a longterm contract we purchase ethylene and propylene on a spot and contract basis to meet our internal and external demands as needed 

 

the raw materials for polyolefins and catalloy process resins are in general commodity chemicals with numerous bulk suppliers and ready availability at competitive prices 

 

industry dynamics  competition 

 

with respect to olefins and polyolefins competition is based on price product quality product delivery reliability of supply product performance and customer service industry consolidation in north america has led to fewer although larger competitors profitability is affected not only by supply and demand for olefins and polyolefins but also by raw material costs and price competition among producers price competition may intensify due to among other things the addition of new capacity in general demand is a function of worldwide economic growth which fluctuates it is not possible to accurately predict the changes in raw material costs market conditions capacity utilization and other factors that will affect industry profitability in the future 

 

based on published rated production capacities we were the second largest producer of ethylene in north america as of december 31 2010 north american ethylene rated capacity at december 31 2010 was approximately 72 billion pounds per year with approximately 84 of that north american capacity located along the gulf coast at december 31 2010 our ethylene rated capacity in the us was approximately 96 billion pounds per year or approximately 13 of total north american ethylene production capacity 

we compete in north america with other large marketers and producers for sales of ethylene and its coproducts such as dow exxonmobil international petroleum investment company “ipic” shell ineos chevronphillips tpc group and others 

 

based on published data regarding pp capacity we believe that including our proportionate share of the indelpro joint venture we are the largest producer of pp in north america as of december 31 2010 with a proportionate share capacity of 33 billion pounds or approximately 17 of the total north american capacity our largest competitors for sales of pp in north america are exxonmobil total braskem formosa plastics and ineos 

 

with respect to pe we believe that we are the third largest producer in north america as of december 31 2010 with 58 billion pounds per year of capacity or approximately 13 of north american capacity our largest competitors for sales of pe in north america are dow exxonmobil ipic chevron phillips ineos and westlake 

 

olefins and polyolefins — europe asia international segment 

 

overview 

 

our op — eai segment produces and markets olefins ethylene and ethylene coproducts and polyolefins we are the largest producer of pp and pe in europe and the largest worldwide producer of pp compounds we also produce significant quantities of other specialty products such as catalloy process resins and pb1 our op — eai segment manages our worldwide pp compound business including our facilities in north and south america our worldwide pb1 business and our catalloy process resins produced in europe and asia we have eight joint ventures located principally in regions with access to low cost feedstocks or access to growing markets in 2010 our op — eai segment generated operating revenues of 125 billion excluding intersegment revenue 

 

we currently produce ethylene propylene and coproducts at three sites in europe and one joint venture site in the middle east butadiene is an important coproduct of this production we produce polyolefins pp and pe at 19 facilities in the eai region including 10 facilities located in europe four facilities located in east asia three facilities located in the middle east and two facilities located in australia our joint ventures own one of the facilities in europe four of the facilities in east asia and three in the middle east 

 

pp compounds consist of specialty products produced from blends of polyolefins and additives and are sold mainly to the automotive and white goods industries we manufacture pp compounds at 15 facilities worldwide a number of which are the same facilities as the polyolefin facilities described above consisting of four facilities in europe five facilities in east asia three in north america two in south america and one facility in australia 

 

we produce catalloy process resins at two sites in the eai region including one in the netherlands and one in italy the process is proprietary technology that is not licensed to third parties and as a result we are the only manufacturer of catalloy process resins 

 

we produce pb1 at one facility in europe we believe that we are the largest worldwide producer of pb1 a family of flexible strong and durable butenebased polymers a majority of the current pb1 we produce is used in pipe applications and for underfloor heating and thermo sanitary systems pb1 is being developed to target new opportunities in applications such as “easyopen” packaging sealpeel film construction fibers and fabrics compounds adhesives and coatings 

 

the following table outlines

see “description of properties” for the locations where we produce the primary products of our op — eai segment annual processing capacity as of december 31 2010 was calculated by estimating the average number of days in a typical year that a production unit of a plant is expected to operate after allowing for downtime for regular maintenance and multiplying that number by an amount equal to the unit’s optimal daily output based on the design raw material mix because the processing capacity of a production unit is an 

estimated amount actual production volumes may be more or less than the capacities set forth below capacities shown include 100 of the capacity of joint venture facilities 

 

sales  marketing  customers 

 

in 2010 no single external op — eai segment customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues 

 

we currently produce ethylene at one site in france two sites in germany and one joint venture site in the middle east our ethylene production is generally consumed internally as a raw material in the production of polymers in western europe we are essentially balanced in our ethylene supply and demand 

 

we currently produce propylene at two sites in france two sites in germany and the three joint venture sites in the middle east we use propylene as a raw material for production of po and pp in europe we are a net purchaser of propylene 

 

we currently produce butadiene at one site in france and one site in germany we generally sell our butadiene under multiyear contracts 

 

we at times purchase ethylene propylene benzene and butadiene for resale when necessary to satisfy customer demand for these products above production levels volumes of ethylene propylene benzene and butadiene purchased for resale can vary significantly from period to period however purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profits 

 

european ethylene and propylene production is generally either fully integrated with or is transported via pipeline to our pe and pp facilities in europe 

 

we produce pp at nine sites in europe four sites in east asia two sites in australia and two sites in the middle east all of the sites in east asia and the middle east and one of the sites in europe poland are owned by joint ventures 

 

we manufacture pe at five sites in europe including one joint venture facility in poland and one joint venture site in the middle east 

 

with respect to pp and pe our production is typically sold to an extensive base of established customers under annual contracts or under customary terms and conditions without formal contracts we believe that over a business cycle average selling prices and profit margins for specialty polymers tend to be higher than average selling prices and profit margins for highervolume commodity pps 

 

for the op — eai segment we typically have marketing arrangements with our joint venture partners to sell and market pp and pe outside the country where such a joint venture facility is located 

 

polyolefins primarily are distributed in europe by rail car or truck 

 

we and our joint ventures manufacture pp compounds at five sites in east asia two of which are owned by joint ventures four sites in europe three sites in north america two sites in south america and one joint venture site in australia we manufacture catalloy process resins at one facility in italy and one facility in the netherlands we also manufacture pb1 at the facility in the netherlands 

 

our regional sales offices are located in various locations including the netherlands hong kong china india and united arab emirates we also operate through a worldwide network of local sales and representative offices in europe asia and africa our joint ventures typically manage their domestic sales and marketing efforts independently and we typically operate as their agentdistributor for exports 

joint venture relationships 

 

the following table describes our op — eai segment’s significant manufacturing joint venture relationships 

 

 

 

 

  

these joint ventures provide us with additional income streams from cash dividends licensing revenues catalyst sales and marketing fees from selling joint venture products as well as geographical diversification and access to local market skills and expertise we generally license our polyolefin process technologies and supply catalysts to our joint ventures some of our joint ventures source cost advantaged raw materials from their local shareholders 

 

we market approximately 70 of the pp produced annually by spc and are currently the exclusive marketer for the pp produced by alwaha that is sold outside of saudi arabia we also market all of bop’s pp hpde and ldpe sales outside of poland our polypacific pty joint venture markets all of its pp compounds production and we market a portion of the pp produced by sunallomer 

 

raw materials 

 

raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost for the production of ethylene and its coproducts the primary raw materials used in our european olefin facilities are heavy liquids and for our saudi joint venture facilities ngls including include ethane propane and butane the principal raw materials used by our polyolefin and catalloy process resins businesses are propylene and ethylene in western europe we have the capacity to produce approximately 50 of the propylene requirements of our european pp business and nearly 90 of the ethylene requirements of our european pe business european propylene and ethylene requirements that are not produced internally generally are purchased pursuant to longterm contracts with thirdparty suppliers and are delivered via pipeline prices under these thirdparty contracts are market related and are negotiated monthly and are generally based on published market indicators normally with discounts 

 

in our wholly owned operations in australia greater than 90 of our propylene normally comes from thirdparty refinery grade propylene purchased under longterm contracts linked to saudi or singapore fuel markers and is processed at our integrated splitters located on each manufacturing site some of our eai joint 

ventures receive propylene from their local shareholders under longterm contracts the remaining supply for the joint ventures is purchased from local suppliers under longterm contracts and some spot purchases our saudi joint ventures alwaha sepc and spc produce their own olefins utilizing cost advantaged saudi arabian propane and ethane 

 

the raw materials for polyolefins are in general commodity chemicals with numerous bulk suppliers and ready availability at competitive prices 

 

a significant portion of the raw materials for our pp compounds are pp and other polymers primarily catalloy process resins our pp compounding facilities generally receive their pp and other polymers from one of our wholly owned or joint venture facilities via truck or rail car in addition there are four sites two in europe one in north america and one in south america that have both pp and pp compounding operations colocated thereby minimizing product handling pb1 raw materials are sourced solely from external supply 

 

industry dynamics  competition 

 

our ethylene rated capacity in western europe at december 31 2010 was approximately 42 billion pounds per year or approximately 8 of the 53 billion pounds per year of total western europe ethylene production capacity based on these published rated production capacities we are the seventh largest producer of ethylene in western europe in western europe key ethylene competitors include ineos dow polimeri europa total sabic shell basf and exxonmobil 

 

based on published data regarding pp capacity we believe that we are the largest producer of pp in western europe as of december 31 2010 with 57 billion pounds per year of capacity or approximately 25 of the western european capacity for pp our largest competitors for sales of pp are polimeri europa total sabic ineos and dow 

 

based on published data regarding pe capacity we believe that we are the largest producer of pe in western europe as of december 31 2010 with 55 billion pounds per year of capacity or approximately 16 of hdpe and ldpe western european capacity our largest competitors for sales of pe are exxonmobil dow ineos sabic total polimeri europe and repsol 

 

we believe we are the largest pp compounds producer in the world with 23 billion pounds which includes our proportionate share of joint ventures of installed annual capacity as of december 31 2010 approximately 54 of our pp compounding capacity is in europe 20 is in north america and 26 is in the rest of the world including the capacity of our joint ventures our competitors for sales of pp compounds are borealis exxonmobil king fa mitsubishi mitsui  sabic sumitomo chemical co ltd washington penn and many other independent companies 

 

our 110 million pound pb1 capacity competes with polybutene producers of which mitsui is the largest and other polymers plastomers and elastomers 

 

intermediates and derivatives segment 

 

overview 

 

our id segment produces and markets po and its coproducts and derivatives acetyls and ethylene oxide and its derivatives po coproducts include sm and c 4 chemicals tba oxyfuels which is managed in the refining  oxyfuels segment isobutylene and tbhp po derivatives include pg pge and bdo we believe that our proprietary po and acetyls production process technologies provide us with a cost advantaged position for these products and their derivatives in 2010 our id segment generated 55 billion of revenues excluding intersegment revenue 

 

we produce po through two distinct technologies based on indirect oxidation processes that yield coproducts one process yields tba as the coproduct the other process yields sm as the coproduct the two technologies are mutually exclusive necessitating that a manufacturing facility be dedicated either to potba or to posm isobutylene and tbhp are derivatives of tba mtbe and etbe are derivatives of isobutylene and are gasoline blending components reported in our refining  oxyfuels segment pg pge and bdo are 

derivatives of po pg collectively refers to monopropylene glycol “mpg” which is pg meeting us pharmacopeia standards and several grades of dipropylene glycol “dpg” and tripropylene glycol “tpg” 

 

the following table outlines

see “description of properties” for the locations where we produce the primary products of our id segment annual processing capacity as of december 31 2010 was calculated by estimating the average number of days in a typical year that a production unit of a plant is expected to operate after allowing for downtime for regular maintenance and multiplying that number by an amount equal to the unit’s optimal daily output based on the design raw material mix because the processing capacity of a production unit is an estimated amount actual production volumes may be more or less than the capacities set forth below except as indicated capacities shown include 100 of the capacity of joint venture facilities 

 

sales  marketing  customers 

 

in 2010 no single id segment customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues 

 

we estimate based in part on published data that worldwide demand for po was approximately 151 billion pounds in 2010 more than 75 of that volume was consumed in the manufacture of three families of po derivative products polyols glycols and glycol ethers the remainder was consumed in the manufacture of performance products including bdo and its derivatives 

 

we produce and deliver our po and po coproducts through sales agreements processing agreements and spot sales as well as product exchanges we have a number of multiyear processing or tolling and sales agreements in addition bayer’s ownership interest in the us po joint venture which operates four of the us operating units represents ownership of an inkind portion of the po production bayer also has the right to 50 of the production of one of the facilities in the netherlands our po derivatives are sold through marketbased sales contracts and spot sales po sold in the merchant market accounted for less than 10 of our total revenues in 2010 

 

production levels at the posm and potba coproduct facilities are primarily determined by the demand for po and po derivatives as a result production levels of sm and tba and its derivatives isobutylene tbhp mtbe and etbe is based primarily on the demand for po and po derivatives and secondarily on the relative market demand for the coproducts and the operational flexibility of our facilities in meeting this demand mtbe and etbe our reported in our refining  oxyfuels segment 

 

based on published data worldwide demand for sm in 2010 is estimated to have been approximately 56 billion pounds sm accounted for less than 10 of our total revenues in 2010 we sell most of our sm production into the north american and european merchant markets and to asian and south american export markets through longterm sales contracts and processing agreements 

we purchase sm for resale when necessary to satisfy customer demand above production levels volumes of sm purchases made for resale can vary significantly from period to period however purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profits 

 

our id segment converts most of its tba which is produced as a coproduct to the po process to isobutylene and sells some of the tba into the market over half of the isobutylene from the id segment is reacted with methanol or ethanol to produce mtbe and etbe which is marketed by the refining  oxyfuels segment the remaining isobutylene is sold as high purity and purity grade isobutylene by the id segment isobutylene sales accounted for less than 10 of our total revenues in 2010 

 

sales of our po its coproducts and its derivatives are made by us nihon oxirane a joint venture of which we own 40 and their affiliates directly and through distributors and independent agents located in the americas europe the middle east africa and the asia pacific region we have centralized certain sales and order fulfillment functions in regional customer service centers located in houston texas rotterdam the netherlands and hong kong china po pg and sm are transported by barge ocean going vessel pipeline rail car and tank truck bdo is primarily transported by tank truck and rail car 

 

acetic acid and vam are manufactured at a facility in la porte texas and are consumed internally sold worldwide generally under multiyear contracts and sold on a spot basis acetic acid and vam are shipped by barge ocean going vessel pipeline rail car and tank truck we have bulk storage arrangements in europe and south america to serve our customers’ requirements in those regions sales are made through a direct sales force agents and distributors sales of acetyls including acetic acid and vam collectively accounted for less than 10 of our total revenues in 2010 

 

we estimate based on published data that worldwide demand in 2010 for acetic acid and vam was 233 billion pounds and 114 billion pounds respectively 

 

methanol is produced at a la porte texas facility owned by la porte methanol company our 85 owned joint venture with linde each party to the joint venture receives its respective share of the methanol production our acetyls business uses the methanol as a raw material for acetic acid and also sells the methanol under annual contracts and on a spot basis to large us customers the product is shipped by barge and pipeline 

 

ethylene oxide “eo” or eo equivalents and eo’s primary derivative ethylene glycol “eg” are produced at a wholly owned facility located in bayport texas the bayport facility also produces other derivatives of eo principally glycol ethers 

 

eo and eg typically are sold under multiyear contracts with marketbased pricing glycol ethers and ethanolamines are sold primarily into the solvent and distributor markets at market prices eo is shipped by rail car and its derivatives are shipped by rail car truck isotank or oceangoing vessel eo and eg sales accounted for less than 10 of our total revenues in 2010 

 

the vast majority of the ethylene derivative products are sold in north america and asia primarily through our sales organizations 

joint venture relationships 

 

the following table describes our id segment’s significant manufacturing joint venture relationships 

 

 

 

 

  

bayer’s ownership interest in the us po joint venture represents its offtake of 15 billion pounds of the joint venture’s po production we take inkind the remaining po production and all coproduct sm and tba production lyondell chemical and bayer have a separate joint venture the po technology joint venture through which bayer was granted a nonexclusive and nontransferable right to use certain of our proprietary po technology in the us po joint venture under the terms of operating and logistics agreements we operate the us po joint venture plants and arrange and coordinate the logistics of po delivery from the plants we do not share marketing or product sales with bayer under the us po joint venture 

 

lyondell chemical and bayer also have a 5050 joint venture the european po joint venture for the ownership of the maasvlakte posm plant near rotterdam the netherlands each party takes inkind 50 of the po and sm production of the european po joint venture 

 

lyondell chemical’s posm ii plant at the channelview texas complex was created through a joint venture among lyondell chemical basf and ipic lyondell chemical retains a majority interest in the joint venture and is the operator of the plant as of december 31 2010 700 million pounds of sm capacity was committed to basf and ipic under processing arrangements 

 

in addition to the nihon oxirane joint venture shown in the table above we participate in marketing most of the po capacity from a 440 million pound facility in rabigh saudi arabia owned by sumitomo and saudi aramco through noc asia co ltd in which we have a 40 equity interest 

 

we jointly market all of the po manufactured by the ningbo zrcc joint venture 

 

we also have a multiyear processing agreement entered into by lyondell chemical and shiny whereby we provide the raw materials used to produce pge at shiny’s pge plant in tainan taiwan 

 

raw materials 

 

the primary raw materials used for the production of po and its coproducts and derivatives are propylene isobutane mixed butane ethylene and benzene the market prices of these raw materials historically have been related to the price of crude oil ngls and natural gas as well as market conditions for the raw materials these raw materials are received in bulk quantities via pipeline or ocean going vessels 

in the us we obtain a large portion of our propylene benzene and ethylene raw materials needed for the production of po and its coproducts and derivatives internally from our crackers raw materials for the nonus production of po and its coproducts and derivatives primarily are obtained from unrelated parties we consume a significant portion of our internallyproduced po in the production of po derivatives 

 

we consume large volumes of mixed butane for the production of po and its coproducts and derivatives we have invested in facilities or entered into processing agreements with unrelated parties to convert the widely available commodity normal butane to isobutane we also are a large consumer of oxygen for our potba plants 

 

the cost of raw materials generally is the largest component of total production cost for po and its coproducts and derivatives generally the raw material requirements for these businesses are purchased at marketbased prices from numerous suppliers in the us and europe with which we have established contractual relationships as well as in the spot market the raw materials for these businesses are in general commodity chemicals with ready availability at competitive prices historically raw material availability has not been an issue however in order to enhance reliability and competitiveness of prices and rates for supplies of raw materials industrial gas and other utilities we have longterm agreements and other arrangements for a substantial portion of our production requirements 

 

the primary raw materials required for the production of acetic acid are carbon monoxide and methanol we purchase the carbon monoxide from linde pursuant to a longterm contract under which pricing is based primarily on cost of production la porte methanol company our 85owned joint venture supplies all of the methanol requirements for acetyls production natural gas is the primary raw material required for the production of methanol 

 

in addition to ethylene acetic acid is a primary raw material for the production of vam for the production of vam we obtain our entire requirements for acetic acid and ethylene from our internal production in 2010 we used a large percentage of our acetic acid production to produce vam 

 

industry dynamics  competition 

 

with respect to po its coproducts and derivatives competition is based on a variety of factors including product quality and price reliability of supply technical support customer service and potential substitute materials profitability is affected by the worldwide level of demand along with price competition which may intensify due to among other things new industry capacity it is expected that from 2011 to 2012 approximately 9 of the 2010 worldwide po capacity will be added in china and thailand during the same period average world demand is expected to grow by approximately 6 however demand is a function of worldwide economic growth which fluctuates the po demand growth rate also could be impacted by further development of alternative biobased po derivatives it is not possible to predict accurately the changes in raw material costs market conditions and other factors that will affect industry profitability in the future 

 

based on published data regarding po capacity we believe that including our share of nihon oxirane ningbo zrcc and the european po joint venture we are the second largest producer of po worldwide with approximately 19 of the total worldwide capacity for po our major worldwide competitors for sales of po and its derivatives are dow and shell 

 

based on published data regarding sm capacity we believe that we are one of the largest producers of sm worldwide with approximately 5 of the total worldwide capacity for sm as of december 31 2010 we compete worldwide for sales of sm with many marketers and producers among which are basf dow ineos shell and total 

 

we believe that we are the fourth and sixth largest producer of acetic acid and vam respectively each with approximately 4 and 5 of the total worldwide capacity as of december 31 2010 our primary competitors include celanese and bp for acetic acid and celanese dow and dupont for vam 

 

refining  oxyfuels segment 

 

overview 

 

our refining  oxyfuels segment refines heavy highsulfur crude oil in the us gulf coast refines light and medium weight crude oil in southern france and produces gasoline blending components at several of our olefin and po units in 2010 our refining  oxyfuels segment generated operating revenues of 135 billion excluding intersegment revenue 

 

the houston refinery which is located on the houston ship channel in houston texas has a heavy highsulfur crude oil processing capacity of approximately 268000 barrels per day on a calendar day basis normal operating basis or approximately 292000 barrels per day on a stream day basis maximum achievable over a 24 hour period the houston refinery has a nelson complexity index of 114 the houston refinery is a full conversion refinery designed to refine heavy highsulfur crude oil this crude oil is more viscous and dense than traditional crude oil and contains higher concentrations of sulfur and heavy metals making it more difficult to refine into gasoline and other highvalue fuel products however this crude oil has historically been less costly to purchase than light lowsulfur crude oil processing heavy highsulfur crude oil in significant quantities requires a refinery with extensive coking catalytic cracking hydrotreating and desulfurization capabilities ie a “complex refinery” the houston refinery’s refined fuel products include gasoline including blendstocks for oxygenate blending jet fuel and ultra low sulfur diesel the houston refinery’s products also include heating oil lube oils industrial lubricants white oils and process oils carbon black oil refinerygrade propylene petrochemical raw materials sulfur residual fuel and petroleum coke 

 

the berre refinery is designed to run light to medium sulfur crude oil and has a current capacity of approximately 105000 barrels per day it produces naphtha vacuum gas oil liquefied petroleum gas gasoline aviation fuel diesel bitumen and heating oil the berre refinery provides raw material and site integration for our operations in france and supports our polyolefin business in europe the berre refinery also provides us with access to significant logistics assets including pipeline access storage terminals and harbor access to the mediterranean sea the berre refinery has a nelson complexity index of 67 

 

the refining  oxyfuels segment also includes gasoline blending components such as mtbe etbe and alkylate mtbe and etbe are produced as coproducts of the po and olefin production process at four sites located in the united states france and the netherlands in 2009 we converted one of our mtbe units at channelview texas to etbe production we currently have three sites that can produce either mtbe or etbe with a combined capacity to produce 59000 barrels per day of mtbe or etbe the company’s total capacity for mtbe or etbe production is 75000 barrels per day alkylate is produced at one facility located in texas 

 

the following table outlines 

 

  

see “description of properties” for the locations where we produce the primary products of our refining  oxyfuels segment 

 

 

 

 

  

sales  marketing  customers 

 

in 2010 no single refining  oxyfuels segment customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues 

 

in the us we market and sell gasoline including blendstocks for oxygenate blending jet fuel heating oil ultra low sulfur diesel fuel lube oils coke and sulfur produced at the houston refinery these products are sold in large commodity markets the houston refinery evaluates and determines its optimal product output mix based on market prices and conditions as a result we are subject to various risks associated with selling commodity products 

 

gasoline sales accounted for 9 of our total revenues in 2010 the houston refinery’s products primarily are sold in bulk on the us gulf coast to other refiners marketers distributors and wholesalers at marketrelated prices diesel fuel is produced to meet ultra low sulfur specifications for the onroad transportation market most of the houston refinery’s products are sold under contracts with a term of one year or less or are sold in the spot market the houston refinery’s products generally are transported to customers via pipelines and terminals owned and operated by other parties products also are transported via rail car barge truck and ocean going vessel in addition to sales of refined products produced by the houston refinery we also sell refined products purchased or received on exchange from other parties the exchange arrangements help optimize refinery supply operations and lower transportation costs to meet market demands we also from time to time purchase refined products manufactured by others for resale to our customers however purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profitability 

 

in europe the berre refinery provides a significant portion of the raw materials requirements for our nearby steam cracker the remaining products are sold into local markets under marketbased sales agreements 

or in the spot market key customers of the berre refinery include other refiners marketers and distributors and its products are primarily transported via pipelines and other infrastructure assets owned by us 

 

mtbe and etbe are derivatives of tba which is a coproduct of the po produced by our id segment as described production levels of the tba derivatives mtbe and etbe depend primarily on the demand for po and po derivatives and secondarily on the relative market demand for mtbe and etbe and the operational flexibility of our multiple production facilities in meeting this demand separately mtbe and alkylate are also produced as derivatives of the ethylene coproducts produced by our op — americas segment when necessary we purchase mtbe for resale to satisfy customer demand for mtbe above our production levels volumes of mtbe purchased for resale can vary significantly from period to period however purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profitability 

 

we sell our mtbe and etbe production under marketbased sales agreements and in the spot market we blend our alkylate into gasoline and also sell alkylate under shortterm contracts and in the spot market sales of mtbe and etbe together and alkylate each accounted for less than 10 of our total revenues in 2010 

 

substantially all refiners and blenders have discontinued the use of mtbe in the us partly as a result of governmental initiatives to increase use of bioethanol in gasoline and to reduce or effectively ban the use of mtbe however mtbeetbe demand for gasoline blending remains strong within most of the remaining worldwide market accordingly we market mtbe and etbe produced in the us for use outside of the us our mtbeetbe plants generally have the flexibility to produce either mtbe or etbe to accommodate market needs 

 

japan has opted to use etbe as a means of meeting its carbon dioxide reduction commitments under the kyoto protocol and we source a significant portion of japan’s biofuels needs 

 

sales of our mtbe etbe and alkylate are made by our marketing and sales personnel and through distributors and independent agents located in the americas europe the middle east africa and the asia pacific region we have centralized certain sales and order fulfillment functions in regional customer service centers located in houston texas rotterdam the netherlands and hong kong china we also have longterm contracts for distribution and logistics to supply to our customers mtbe etbe and alkylate are transported by barge ocean going vessel and tank truck 

 

raw materials 

 

the largest source of the crude oil used as a raw material for the houston refinery in the past several years has been a crude supply agreement with pdvsapetroleo sa a corporation organized under the laws of the bolivarian republic of venezuela which terminates in july 2011 during 2010 less than half of our crude supply was purchased under the crude supply agreement with pdvsa 

 

most of the crude oil used as a raw material for the berre refinery is sourced from north africa the middle east russia and other areas generally available in the mediterranean region 

 

we purchase our ethanol requirements for the production of etbe from regional producers and importers in europe at marketrelated prices additionally we have entered into a supply contract with a brazilian ethanol producer to supply a significant portion of the ethanol used for the manufacture of etbe at our channelview facility for further discussion regarding the raw materials requirements for the production of mtbe etbe and alkylate see “— intermediates and derivatives — raw materials” 

 

industry dynamics  competition 

 

the markets for fuel products tend to be volatile as well as cyclical as a result of changing global economic conditions and prices for crude oil and refined product prices crude oil prices are impacted by worldwide economic conditions and political events the economics of exploration and production refined products demand and currency fluctuations prices and demand for fuel products are influenced by seasonal and shortterm factors such as weather and driving patterns as well as by longer term issues such as the 

economy energy conservation and alternative fuels industry fuel products supply is dependent on shortterm industry operating capabilities and on longterm refining capacity 

 

with a throughput capacity of approximately 268000 barrels per day on a calendar day basis we believe that the houston refinery is among north america’s largest full conversion refineries capable of processing significant quantities of heavy highsulfur crude oil 

 

in north america we compete for the purchase of heavy highsulfur crude oil based on price and quality our crude oil supply contract with pdvsa oil terminates in july 2011 which will increase the need for us to purchase crude oil competitively on the open market we began diversifying our portfolio in 2010 and expect to continue to purchase some of our crude oil from sources other than pdvsa on marketbased terms we compete in gasoline and distillate markets as a bulk supplier of fungible products satisfying industry and government specifications competition is based on price and location our refining competitors are major integrated oil companies refineries owned or controlled by foreign governments and independent domestic refiners based on published data as of january 2011 there were 148 operable crude oil refineries in the us and total us refinery capacity was approximately 176 million barrels per day 

 

during 2010 the houston refinery processed an average of approximately 241000 barrels per day of crude oil representing approximately 1 of all us crude processing capacity 

 

a crack spread is a benchmark indication of refining margins based on the processing of a specific type of crude oil into an assumed selection of refined products the houston refinery generally tracks the maya 211 crack spread which represents the difference between the first month futures price of two barrels of maya crude oil as set by pemex and one barrel each of us gulf coast 87 octane conventional gasoline and us gulf coast no 2 heating oil highsulfur diesel the berre refinery refining spreads generally track the 4121 ural reported benchmark spread this spread is calculated by adding the price of one barrel of gasoline to the price of two barrels of diesel and one barrel of 6 fuel oil and subtracting the price of four barrels of mediterranean crude oil while these benchmark refining spreads are generally indicative of the level of profitability at both the houston refinery and the berre refinery there are many other factors specific to each refinery that influence operating results 

 

we believe that we are the largest producer of mtbeetbe worldwide we compete for sales of mtbe and etbe with independent mtbe producers worldwide and independent etbe producers mainly in europe the most significant mtbe competitor is saudi basic industries corp and the most significant etbe competitors are repsol total neste and braskem mtbe and etbe face competition from products such as ethanol and other octane components we compete with other refiners and olefin manufacturers for sales of alkylate that we do not internally blend into gasoline 

 

technology segment 

 

overview 

 

our technology segment develops and licenses polyolefin and other process technologies and provides associated engineering and other services our technology segment further develops manufactures and sells polyolefin catalysts we market our process technologies and our polyolefin catalysts to external customers and also use them in our own manufacturing operations in 2010 our technology segment generated operating revenues of 395 million excluding intersegment revenue 

 

our polyolefin process licenses are structured to provide a standard core technology with individual customer needs met by adding customized modules that provide the required capabilities to produce the defined production grade slate and plant capacity for licenses involving proven technologies we typically receive the majority of our license fees in cash at or before the date of customer acceptance rather than ongoing royalties for these licenses we generally recognize revenue upon delivery of the process design package and the related license each license agreement includes longterm confidentiality provisions to protect the technology in addition to the basic license agreement a range of services can also be provided including project assistance training startup assistance of the plant and supply of resins from our production for premarketing by the licensee we may also offer marketing and sales services in addition licensees 

generally continue to purchase polyolefin catalysts that are consumed in the production process generally under longterm catalyst supply agreements with us 

 

process technology licensing 

 

we are a leading licensor of polyolefin process technologies 

 

our pp licensing portfolio includes our spheripol and spherizone process technologies as well as metocene technology 

 

our pe process licensing portfolio comprises the lupotech t high pressure tubular process for producing ldpe the lupotech a autoclave process mainly for producing ethylene vinyl acetate eva copolymers hostalen slurry process for producing multimodal hdpe and spherilene gas phase process for producing fulldensity range of lldpe to hdpe processes 

 

in addition we license a selective portfolio of chemical process technologies in the fields of olefin recovery olefin conversion aromatics extraction and acetyls 

 

since 2000 we have sold licenses representing approximately 25 million tons of polyolefin capacity which represents about 40 of worldwide installed capacity in 2010 we entered into licensing agreements representing about one million tons of polyolefin capacity process licenses accounted for less than 10 of our total revenues in 2010 

 

our technology segment also provides technology services to our licensees such services include safety reviews training and startup assistance engineering services for process and product improvements and manufacturing troubleshooting 

 

pp process technology 

 

we license several pp process technologies including spheripol  spherizone and metocene  

 

our spheripol technology produces homopolymers and random copolymers in a single stage and impact copolymers in a multistage process we believe that the spheripol process is the most widely used pp production process in the world 

 

the spherizone process our newest technology commercialized in 2002 and introduced for licensing in 2004 is able to produce higher quality pp novel ppbased polyolefinic resins and a wider product grade range than existing processes at similar operating cost the spherizone process introduces a single reactor concept in which bimodality is created within one single reactor operating at different conditions between the different zones inside the reactor the final product is a result of an intimate mixing of the different property determining phases at a “macro molecular” level 

 

metocene pp technology was introduced for licensing in 2006 this addon technology for the production of specialty pp products is based on using singlesite catalyst systems metocene technology can be adapted to virtually any pp process and its versatility expands the end use product range of conventional pp in 2009 polymirae became the first licensee to commence commercial production of metocene  

 

pe processes technology 

 

the different families of pe hdpe ldpe and lldpe require specialized process technologies for production which are available through our broad pe process licensing portfolio the portfolio includes lupotech  spherilene and hostalen process technologies 

 

lupotech t is a high pressure tubular reactor process for the production of ldpe this high pressure technology does not use a catalyst system typical for low pressure processes but rather peroxide initiators to polymerize ethylene and optionally vam for evacopolymers by adjusting the temperature profile along the reactor and adding different peroxide mixtures process conditions are modified to produce the desired products the process produces the entire melt flow ratio and density range with competitive investment costs and low utilities and raw material demand 

lupotech a is a high pressure autoclave process using peroxide mixture for polymerization and is mainly utilized for specialty ldpe and for the production of eva copolymers with high vam content 

 

spherilene is a flexible gasphase process for the production of the entire density range of pe products from lldpe and mdpe to hdpe the flexibility of this technology which is demonstrated by a broad portfolio of grades enables licensees to effectively manage the continuously dynamic pe markets at low investments costs and very low operating costs 

 

hostalen is a lowpressure slurry process technology for the production of highperformance multimodal hdpe grades this is desirable because a different product structure can be produced in each stage of the polymerization process yielding products that are tailored for demanding processing requirements and sophisticated end use applications such as film blow molding and pipe applications 

 

chemical process technologies 

 

we also offer for licensing a selective number of chemical processes including the group of trans4m processes aromatics extractions glacido and vacido technology 

 

the trans4m portfolio of process technologies offers tailored solutions for c4 and higher olefin recovery and conversion these processes include separation purification and skeletal isomerization of the c4 and c5 olefin streams for the selective conversion of lowvalue mixed olefin streams from crackers to isobutylene isoamylenes butadiene isoprene piperylene and dicyclopentadiene dcpd this group of processes is complemented by aromatics extractions technology which enables lyondellbasell to offer a comprehensive portfolio of processes to upgrade all olefinic streams from steam crackers to higher value products 

 

glacido is a process technology for manufacturing of acetic acid by carbonylation of methanol it utilizes a rhodiumbased homogeneous catalyst system vacido is a fixedbed tubular process for the production of highquality vam from acetic acid and ethylene it utilizes a proprietary heterogeneous catalyst system 

 

superflex technology produces propylene and ethylene and is based on a fluidized catalytic reactor the process technology is used for cracking less refined feedstock such as coker or fluid catalytic cracking unit light gasoline as well as mixed c4 to c9 streams 

 

polyolefin catalysts 

 

under the avant brand we are a leading manufacturer and supplier of polyolefin catalysts polyolefin catalysts accounted for less than 10 of our total revenues in 2010 as a large polyolefin producer approximately 30 of catalyst sales are intercompany polyolefin catalysts are packaged and shipped via road sea or air to our customers 

 

we produce catalysts at two facilities in germany one facility in italy and one facility in the us our polyolefin catalysts which are consumed during the polyolefin production process and define the processing and mechanical properties of polyolefins provide enhanced performance for our process technologies and are being developed to enhance performance when used in thirdparty process technologies we also supply catalysts for producing sophisticated pes 

 

customers using polyolefin catalysts must make continual purchases because they are consumed during the polyolefin production process new licensees generally elect to enter into longterm catalyst supply agreements 

 

sales  marketing 

 

in 2010 no single technology segment customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues we market our process technologies and catalysts to external customers and also use them for our own polyolefin manufacturing operations we have a marketing and sales force dedicated to the technology segment including catalyst sales and customer technical support for licensees 

industry dynamics  competition 

 

we believe that competition in the polyolefin process licensing industry is based on the quality and efficiency of the process technology product performance and product application complemented by customer service and technical support since the formation of basell in 2000 through december 31 2010 we have sold licenses representing approximately 25 million tons of capacity based on its six process technologies to polyolefin manufacturers we estimate that approximately 40 of pp and 31 of pe worldwide licensed capacity from 2003 through 2010 use our technologies as of december 31 2010 we estimate that over 200 polyolefin production lines use our licensed process technologies our major competitors in pp technologies licensing are dow chemical ineos novolene technology holdings and mitsui chemicals our major competitors in pe technologies licensing are chevronphillips ineos mitsui chemicals and univation technologies 

 

we are one of the world’s largest manufacturers and suppliers of pp catalysts we also supply catalysts for producing pes our major competitors in the worldwide catalyst business are dow chemical basf mitsui chemicals toho catalyst and wr grace

as of december 31 2010 approximately 915 of our employees are directly engaged in research and development activities 

 

in addition to our research and development activities we provide technical support to our customers our technical support centers are located in bayreuth germany geelong australia lansing michigan and tarragona spain 

 

in 2010 2009 and 2008 our research and development expenditures were 154 million 145 million and 194 million respectively a portion of these expenses are related to technical support and customer service and are allocated primarily to the segments 

 

general 

 

intellectual property 

 

we maintain an extensive patent portfolio and continue to file new patent applications in the us and other countries as of december 31 2010 we owned approximately 6500 patents and patent applications worldwide our patents and trade secrets cover our processes products and catalysts and are significant to our competitive position particularly with regard to propylene oxide intermediate chemicals petrochemicals polymers and our process technologies such as spheripol  spherizone  hostalen  spherilene  lupotech  glacido  vacido  isomplus and avant catalysts we own globally registered and unregistered trademarks including the “lyondellbasell” “lyondell” “equistar” and “houston refining” trade names while we believe that our intellectual property provides competitive advantages we do not regard our businesses as being materially dependent upon any single patent trade secret or trademark some of our heritage production capacity operates under licenses from third parties 

 

we rely on patent copyright and trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing our employees working on these technologies are required to enter into agreements or are covered by other arrangements such as collective bargaining agreements providing for confidentiality and the assignment of rights to inventions made by them while employed by us 

 

environmental 

 

regulation 

 

we are subject to extensive international national state local and environmental laws regulations directives rules and ordinances concerning and are required to have permits and licenses regulating emissions to the air discharges onto land or waters and the generation handling storage transportation treatment disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials 

 

under the european union “eu” integrated pollution prevention and control directive “ippc” eu member state governments are to adopt rules and implement an environmental permitting program relating to air water and waste for individual facilities the eu countries are at varying stages in their respective implementation of the ippc permit program we do not know with certainty what future ippc permits will require or the future costs of compliance with the ippc permit program the eu also has passed legislation governing the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals known as reach pursuant to which we are required to register chemicals and gain authorization for the use of certain substances as an importer of chemicals and materials from outside the eu we are subject to additional registration obligations 

 

we also are subject to environmental laws that may have a significant effect on the nature and scope of cleanup of contamination at current and former operating facilities and at other sites at which hazardous substances generated by our current or former subsidiaries were disposed the costs of transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products and the costs of the storage and disposal of wastewater in the 

us the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended and also known as superfund “cercla” imposes joint and several liability for the costs of remedial investigations and cleanup actions as well as damages to natural resources on entities that generated hazardous substances arranged for disposal of the hazardous substances transported to or selected the disposal sites and the past and present owners and operators of such sites all such responsible parties or any one of them can be required to bear all of such costs regardless of fault the legality of the original disposal or ownership of the disposal site we are subject to potential liability under cercla as an owner or operator of facilities at which hazardous substances have been disposed or as a generator or transporter of hazardous substances disposed at other locations 

 

under the eu environmental liability directive eu member states can require the remediation of soil and groundwater contamination in certain circumstances under the “polluter pays principle” the scope of events and circumstances that could trigger remediation requirements and the level of remediation required vary from member state to member state 

 

under the us resource conservation and recovery act of 1976 “rcra” various us state and nonus government regulations regulate the handling transporting and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous waste our manufacturing sites have and may in the future handle onsite waste disposal subjecting us to these laws and regulations 

 

capital expenditures 

 

in some cases compliance with environmental health and safety laws and regulations can only be achieved by capital expenditures regulatoryrelated capital expenditures at our facilities were 121 million 250 million and 209 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively and we estimate such expenditures to be approximately 243 million in 2011 and 221 million in 2012 

 

our actual capital expenditures in 2010 primarily relate to projects designed to reduce and control emissions from our plant operations in both the us and europe 

 

stricter environmental safety and health laws regulations and enforcement policies could result in increased environmental capital expenditures by us above current estimates 

 

employee relations 

 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 14000 fulltime and parttime employees of these approximately 5900 were located in north america approximately 7200 were located in europe and approximately 1000 were in other locations 

 

as of december 31 2010 approximately 900 of our employees located in north america are represented by labor unions the vast majority of our employees in europe and south america are subject to staff council or works council coverage or collective bargaining agreements 

 

in addition to our own employees we use the services of contractors in the routine conduct of our businesses 

 

we believe our relations with our employees are good

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend  

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 

 

economic downturns and disruptions in financial markets can adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

our results of operations can be materially affected by adverse conditions in the financial markets and depressed economic conditions generally economic downturns in the businesses and geographic areas in which we sell our products substantially reduce demand for our products and result in decreased sales volumes recessionary environments adversely affect our business because demand for our products is reduced particularly from our customers in industrial markets generally and the automotive and housing industries specifically 

 

moreover many of our customers and suppliers rely on access to credit to adequately fund their operations disruptions in financial markets and economic slowdown can adversely impact the ability of our customers to finance the purchase of our products as well as the creditworthiness of those customers these same factors may also impact the ability and willingness of suppliers to provide us with raw materials for our business 

 

the cyclicality and volatility of the industries in which we participate may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 

 

our business operations are subject to the cyclical and volatile nature of the supplydemand balance in the chemical and refining industries our future operating results are expected to continue to be affected by this cyclicality and volatility the chemical and refining industries historically have experienced alternating periods of capacity shortages causing prices and profit margins to increase followed by periods of excess capacity resulting in oversupply declining capacity utilization rates and declining prices and profit margins 

 

in addition to changes in the supply and demand for products changes in energy prices and other worldwide economic conditions can cause volatility these factors result in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over business cycles 

 

in addition new capacity additions especially in asia and the middle east are expected to lead to a period of oversupply and lower profitability the timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions is uncertain and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time as a consequence we are unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of future industry cycles or their effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we can give no assurances as to any predictions we may make with respect to the timing extent or duration of future industry cycles 

costs and limitations on supply of raw materials and energy may result in increased operating expenses 

 

the costs of raw materials and energy represent a substantial portion of our operating expenses energy costs generally follow price trends of crude oil and natural gas these price trends may be highly volatile and cyclical in the past raw material and energy costs have experienced significant fluctuations that adversely affected our business segments’ results of operations moreover fluctuations in currency exchange rates can add to this volatility 

 

we are not always able to pass raw material and energy cost increases on to our customers when we do have the ability to pass on the cost increases we are not always able to do so quickly enough to avoid adverse impacts on our results of operations 

 

cost increases also may increase working capital needs which could reduce our liquidity and cash flow even if we increase our sales prices to reflect rising raw material and energy costs demand for products may decrease as customers reduce their consumption or use substitute products which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition producers in natural gas costadvantaged regions such as the middle east benefit from the lower prices of natural gas and ngls competition from producers in these regions may cause us to reduce exports from north america and europe any such reductions may increase competition for product sales within north america and europe which can result in lower margins in those regions additionally there are a limited number of suppliers for some of our raw materials and utilities and in some cases the supplies are specific to the particular geographic region in which a facility is located 

 

it is also common in the chemical and refining industries for a facility to have a sole dedicated source for its utilities such as steam electricity and gas having a sole or limited number of suppliers may limit our negotiating power particularly in the case of rising raw material costs any new supply agreements we enter into may not have terms as favorable as those contained in our current supply agreements 

 

if our raw material or utility supplies were disrupted our businesses may incur increased costs to procure alternative supplies or incur excessive downtime which would have a direct negative impact on plant operations for example hurricanes have in the past negatively affected crude oil and natural gas supplies as well as supplies of other raw materials utilities such as electricity and steam and industrial gases contributing to increases in operating costs and in some cases disrupting production in addition hurricanerelated disruption of vessel barge rail truck and pipeline traffic in the us gulf coast area would negatively affect shipments of raw materials and product 

 

in addition with increased volatility in raw material costs our suppliers could impose more onerous terms on us resulting in shorter payment cycles and increasing our working capital requirements 

 

we sell products in highly competitive global markets and face significant price pressures 

 

we sell our products in highly competitive global markets due to the commodity nature of many of our products competition in these markets is based primarily on price and to a lesser extent on product performance product quality product deliverability reliability of supply and customer service generally we are not able to protect our market position for these products by product differentiation and may not be able to pass on cost increases to our customers 

 

in addition we face increased competition from companies that may have greater financial resources and different cost structures or strategic goals than us these include large integrated oil companies many of which also have chemical businesses governmentowned businesses and companies that receive subsidies or other government incentives to produce certain products in a specified geographic region increased competition from these companies especially in our olefin and refining businesses could limit our ability to increase product sales prices in response to raw material and other cost increases or could cause us to reduce product sales prices to compete effectively which could reduce our profitability competitors that have greater financial resources than us may be able to invest significant capital into their businesses including expenditures for research and development 

in addition specialty products we produce may become commoditized over time increased competition could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 

 

our ability to source raw materials including crude oil may be adversely affected by political instability civil disturbances or other governmental actions 

 

we obtain a substantial portion of our principal raw materials from sources in north africa the middle east and south america that may be less politically stable than other areas in which we conduct business such as europe or the us 

 

recently increased incidents of civil unrest including demonstrations which have been marked by violence have occurred in some countries in north africa and the middle east some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest political instability and civil unrest could continue to spread in the region and involve other areas such unrest if it continues to spread or grow in intensity could lead to civil wars regional conflict or regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to countries in which we conduct substantial business such as europe the us or their respective allies 

 

we source a large portion of our crude oil from venezuela from time to time in the past the venezuelan national oil company pdvsa has declared itself in a force majeure situation and reduced deliveries of crude oil purportedly based on announced opec production cuts it is impossible to predict how possible changes in governmental policies may affect our sourcing any significant reduction in venezuelan crude oil supplies could negatively impact our ability to procure crude oil from venezuela or other sources on economically advantageous terms political instability civil disturbances and actions by governments in north africa the middle east or south america are likely to substantially increase the price and decrease the supply of feedstocks necessary for our operations which will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

interruptions of operations at our facilities may result in liabilities or lower operating results 

 

we own and operate largescale facilities our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our various production facilities and the ability to complete construction and maintenance projects on schedule interruptions at our facilities may materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or our business as a whole during and after the period of such operational difficulties in the past we had to shut down plants on the us gulf coast including the temporary shutdown of the houston refinery as a result of hurricanes striking the texas coast 

 

in addition because the houston refinery is our only north american refining operation an outage at the refinery could have a particularly negative impact on our operating results unlike our chemical and polymer production facilities which may have sufficient excess capacity to mitigate the negative impact of lost production at other facilities we do not have the ability to increase refining production elsewhere in the us 

 

although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions our operations are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and refining and the related storage and transportation of raw materials products and wastes these potential hazards include 

 

 33 

 

  

some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities 

 

our operations are subject to risks inherent in chemical and refining businesses and we could be subject to liabilities for which we are not fully insured or that are not otherwise mitigated 

 

we maintain property business interruption product general liability casualty and other types of insurance including pollution and legal liability that we believe are in accordance with customary industry practices however we are not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to our business including losses resulting from natural disasters war risks or terrorist acts changes in insurance market conditions have caused and may in the future cause premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies to increase substantially and in some instances for certain insurance to become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured we might not be able to finance the amount of the uninsured liability on terms acceptable to us or at all and might be obligated to divert a significant portion of our cash flow from normal business operations 

 

further because a part of our business involves licensing polyolefin process technology our licensees are exposed to similar risks involved in the manufacture and marketing of polyolefins hazardous incidents involving our licensees if they do result or are perceived to result from use of our technologies may harm our reputation threaten our relationships with other licensees andor lead to customer attrition and financial losses our policy of covering these risks through contractual limitations of liability and indemnities and through insurance may not always be effective as a result our financial condition and results of operation would be adversely affected and other companies with competing technologies may have the opportunity to secure a competitive advantage 

 

certain activities related to a former project raise compliance issues under us law 

 

we have identified an agreement related to a former project in kazakhstan under which a payment was made in late 2008 that raises compliance concerns under the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” we have engaged outside counsel to investigate these activities under the oversight of a special committee established by the supervisory board and to evaluate internal controls and compliance policies and procedures we made a voluntary disclosure of these matters to the us department of justice in late 2009 and are cooperating fully with that agency in this respect we may not have conducted our business in compliance with the fcpa and may not have had policies and procedures in place adequate to ensure compliance we cannot reasonably estimate any potential penalty that may arise from these matters we have adopted and are implementing more stringent policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters at this time since our investigations are ongoing violations of these laws could result in criminal and civil liabilities and other forms of relief that could be material to us 

our nonus operations conduct business in countries subject to us economic sanctions and certain activities raise compliance issues under us law 

 

certain of our nonus subsidiaries conduct business in countries subject to us economic sanctions including iran us and eu laws and regulations prohibit certain persons from engaging in business activities in whole or in part with sanctioned countries organizations and individuals 

 

we have and continue to adopt more significant compliance policies and procedures to ensure compliance with all applicable sanctions laws and regulations in connection with our continuing review of compliance risks in this area we made a voluntary disclosure of certain matters to the us treasury department and intend to continue cooperating fully with that agency we cannot at this point in time predict the outcome of this matter because our investigation is ongoing but there is a risk that we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties 

 

we have made the decision to terminate all business by the company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries with the government entities and individuals in iran syria and sudan we have notified our counterparties in these countries of our decision and may be subject to legal actions to enforce agreements with the counterparties these activities present a potential risk that could subject the company to private legal proceedings that could be material to us at this time we cannot predict the outcome because our withdrawal activities are ongoing 

 

our operations could be adversely affected by labor relations 

 

the vast majority of our employees located in europe and south america are represented by labor unions and work councils approximately 900 of our employees located in north america are represented by labor unions of the north american employees approximately 50 include our employees that are covered by a collective bargaining agreement between houston refining lp and the united steelworkers union which expires on january 31 2012 

 

our operations have been in the past and may be in the future significantly and adversely affected by strikes work stoppages and other labor disputes 

 

we cannot predict with certainty the extent of future costs under environmental health and safety and other laws and regulations and cannot guarantee they will not be material 

 

we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture handle or own in addition because our products are components of a variety of other enduse products we along with other members of the chemical industry are subject to potential claims related to those enduse products any substantial increase in the success of these types of claims could negatively affect our operating results 

 

we together with the industries in which we operate are subject to extensive national regional state and local environmental laws regulations directives rules and ordinances concerning 

 

  

many of these laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations in addition some of these laws and regulations require us to meet specific financial responsibility requirements any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

although we have compliance programs and other processes intended to ensure compliance with all such regulations we are subject to the risk that our compliance with such regulations could be challenged noncompliance with certain of these regulations could result in the incurrence of additional costs penalties or assessments that could be material 

 

our industry is subject to extensive government regulation and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures 

 

compliance with regulatory requirements could result in higher operating costs such as regulatory requirements relating to emissions the security of our facilities and the transportation export or registration of our products we generally expect that regulatory controls worldwide will become increasingly more demanding but cannot accurately predict future developments increasingly strict environmental laws and inspection and enforcement policies could affect the handling manufacture use emission or disposal of products other materials or hazardous and nonhazardous waste stricter environmental safety and health laws regulations and enforcement policies could result in increased operating costs additionally we are required to have permits for our businesses and are subject to licensing regulations these permits and licenses are subject to renewal modification and in some circumstances revocation further the permits and licenses are often difficult time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations 

 

we may incur substantial costs to comply with climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives 

 

there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas “ghg” reduction these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future laws in this field continue to evolve and while they are likely to be increasingly widespread and stringent at this stage it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation within the framework of eu emissions trading we were allocated certain allowances of carbon dioxide per year for the affected plants of our european sites for the 2005 to 2007 period for the second trading period 2008 to 2012 a number of our plants are included in the europewide trading system we expect to incur additional costs as a result of the existing emissions trading scheme and could incur additional costs in relation to any future carbon or other greenhouse gas emission trading schemes the costs could be higher to the extent that we decide to sell credits that we need in the future 

 

in the us the environmental protection agency the “epa” has promulgated federal ghg regulations under the clean air act affecting certain sources the epa has issued mandatory ghg reporting requirements which could lead to further obligations the recent epa action could be a precursor to further federal regulation of carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases and may affect the outcome of other climate change lawsuits pending in united states federal courts in a manner unfavorable to our industry in any event additional regulation is likely to be forthcoming at the united states federal level or the state level with respect to ghg emissions and such regulation could result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances 

 

compliance with these or other changes in laws regulations and obligations that create a ghg emissions trading scheme or ghg reduction policies generally could significantly increase our costs or reduce demand for products we produce depending on the nature of potential regulations and legislation any future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

legislation and regulatory initiatives could lead to a decrease in demand for our products 

 

new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health safety and the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products initiatives by governments and private interest groups will potentially require increased toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us for example in the united states the national toxicology program “ntp” is a federal interagency program that seeks to 

identify and select for study chemicals and other substances to evaluate potential human health hazards in the european commission reach is regulation designed to identify the intrinsic properties of chemical substances assess hazards and risks of the substances and identify and implement the risk management measures to protect humans and the environment 

 

assessments by the ntp reach or similar programs or regulations in other jurisdictions may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals we use or produce and may result in additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of those chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

 

we operate internationally and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations exchange controls political risks and other risks relating to international operations 

 

we operate internationally and are subject to the risks of doing business on a global level including fluctuations in currency exchange rates transportation delays and interruptions war terrorist activities epidemics pandemics political and economic instability and disruptions restrictions on the transfer of funds the imposition of duties and tariffs import and export controls changes in governmental policies labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments recent demonstrations and popular unrest in portions of the middle east are examples of these events 

 

these events could reduce the demand for our products decrease the prices at which we can sell our products disrupt production or other operations require substantial capital and other costs to comply andor increase security costs or insurance premiums all of which could reduce our operating results in addition we obtain a substantial portion of our principal raw materials from international sources that are subject to these same risks our compliance with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject could be challenged furthermore these laws may be modified the result of which may be to prevent or limit subsidiaries from transferring cash to us 

 

furthermore we are subject to certain existing and may be subject to possible future laws that limit or may limit our activities while some of our competitors may not be subject to such laws which may adversely affect our competitiveness 

 

in addition we generate revenues from export sales and operations that may be denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency exchange rates between these currencies and functional currencies in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future future events which may significantly increase or decrease the risk of future movement in currencies in which we conduct our business cannot be predicted we also may hedge certain revenues and costs using derivative instruments to minimize the impact of changes in the exchange rates of those currencies compared to the respective functional currencies it is possible that fluctuations in exchange rates will result in reduced operating results 

 

significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may adversely affect the valuation of pension obligations the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost 

 

our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets may result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets particularly equity securities or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets any change in key actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate would impact the valuation of pension obligations affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years 

certain of our current pension plans are underfunded as of december 31 2010 our pension plans were underfunded by 1173 million any declines in the fair values of the pension plans assets could require additional payments by us in order to maintain specified funding levels 

 

our pension plans are subject to legislative and regulatory requirements of applicable jurisdictions which could include under certain circumstances local governmental authority to terminate the plan 

 

we may be required to record material charges against our earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets 

 

we may be required to reduce production at or idle facilities for extended periods of time or exit certain businesses as a result of the cyclical nature of our industry specifically oversupplies of or lack of demand for particular products or high raw material prices may cause us to reduce production we may choose to reduce production at certain facilities because we have offtake arrangements at other facilities which makes any reductions or idling unavailable at those facilities any decision to permanently close facilities or exit a business likely would result in impairment and other charges to earnings 

 

temporary outages at our facilities can last for several quarters and sometimes longer these outages could cause us to incur significant costs including the expenses of maintaining and restarting these facilities in addition even though we may reduce production at facilities we may be required to continue to purchase or pay for utilities or raw materials under takeorpay supply agreements 

 

many of our businesses depend on our intellectual property our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and our inability to do so could reduce our ability to maintain our competitiveness and margins 

 

we have a significant worldwide patent portfolio of issued and pending patents these patents together with proprietary technical knowhow are significant to our competitive position particularly with regard to po performance chemicals petrochemicals and polymers including process technologies such as spheripol spherizone hostalen spherilene lupotech t and lupotech g and avant catalyst family technology rights we rely on the patent copyright and trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our investment in research and development manufacturing and marketing however we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without authorization proceedings to protect these rights could be costly and we may not prevail 

 

the protection afforded by patents varies from country to country and depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage while a presumption of validity exists with respect to patents issued to us our patents may be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable as patents expire the products and processes described and claimed under those patents become generally available for use by competitors 

 

our continued growth strategy may bring us to regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce in addition patent rights may not prevent our competitors from developing using or selling products that are similar or functionally equivalent to our products moreover our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner which could result in significantly lower revenues reduced profit margins or loss of market share 

 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary knowhow and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property these confidentiality agreements may be breached may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies may not be available additionally others could obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal or illegal means 

 

the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes apparatuses technology trade secrets or proprietary knowhow could result in significantly lower revenues reduced profit margins and cash flows 

andor loss of market share we also may be subject to claims that our technology patents or other intellectual property infringes on a third party’s intellectual property rights unfavorable resolution of these claims could result in restrictions on our ability to deliver the related service or in a settlement that could be material to us 

 

we may not be able to fully or successfully implement our ongoing plans to improve and globally integrate our business processes and functions 

 

we continue to seek ways to drive greater productivity flexibility and cost savings in particular we are working towards the improvement and global integration of our business processes and functions as part of these efforts we have been centralizing certain functions within the company implementing new information technology and integrating our existing information technology systems 

 

our ongoing implementation of organizational improvements is made more difficult by our need to coordinate geographically dispersed operations inabilities and delays in implementing improvements can negatively affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings in addition the process of organizational improvements may cause interruptions of or loss of momentum in the activities of the company’s businesses it may also result in the loss of personnel or other labor issues these issues as well as any information technology systems failures also could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 

 

shared control or lack of control of joint ventures may delay decisions or actions regarding the joint ventures 

 

a portion of our operations are conducted through joint ventures where control may be exercised by or shared with unaffiliated third parties we cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners including any nonperformance default or bankruptcy of joint venture partners the joint ventures that we do not control may also lack adequate internal controls systems 

 

in the event that any of our joint venture partners do not observe their obligations it is possible that the affected joint venture would not be able to operate in accordance with our business plans as a result we could be required to increase our level of commitment in order to give effect to such plans differences in views among the joint venture participants also may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major matters potentially adversely affecting the business and operations of the joint ventures and in turn our business and operations 

 

litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

 

we are involved in civil litigation in the ordinary course of our business and from timetotime are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business the timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain additionally the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments adversely affecting our liquidity and earnings 

 

our capital requirements could limit or cause us to change our growth and development plans 

 

at december 31 2010 we have approximately 61 billion of total consolidated debt our debt and the limitations imposed on us by our financing arrangements could 

 

 39 

 

if our cash flow from operations and capital resources were reduced we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or other planned uses of our cash due to our substantial debt service obligations we could choose to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness but there can be no assurances that we would be able to do so on terms we deem acceptable if at all additionally our debt instruments may limit our ability to effect such actions 

 

our debt or other financing arrangements contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us there also is a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio contained in our us abl facility that is applicable if availability under the facility falls below certain levels we currently are in compliance with all of our restrictive and financial covenants however the ability to meet financial requirements can be affected by events beyond our control and over time these covenants may not be satisfied 

 

a breach of covenants of or the failure to pay principal and interest when due under our debt or other financing could result in a default or crossdefault under all or some of those instruments any such default could result in an acceleration of all amounts outstanding under all facilities and could relieve counterparties of their obligations to fund or otherwise make advances without waivers from the parties to our financing arrangements any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate 

 

a substantial portion of our shares are owned by a few persons and their interests in lyondellbasell industries nv may conflict with other stakeholders’ interests 

 

three shareholders collectively own approximately 52 of our outstanding ordinary shares under dutch law there are no quorum requirements for shareholder voting and most matters are approved or adopted by a majority of votes cast as a result as long as these shareholders or any other substantial shareholder own directly or indirectly a substantial portion of our outstanding shares they will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring shareholder approval including amendments to our articles of association the election of directors significant corporate transactions dividend payments and other matters these shareholders may have interests that conflict with other shareholders and actions may be taken that other shareholders do not view as beneficial 

 

additionally each of these three shareholders is party to a nomination agreement that entitles the shareholder cause our supervisory board to nominate for election members to our supervisory board for so long as the shareholder owns specified percentages of our ordinary shares 

 

we are subject to dutch law and the rights of our ordinary shareholders may be different from those rights associated with companies governed by other laws 

 

as a result of being organized under the laws of the netherlands our corporate structure as well as the rights and obligations of our ordinary shareholders may be different from the rights and obligations of shareholders in companies incorporated in other jurisdictions resolutions of the general meeting of shareholders may be taken with majorities different from the majorities required for adoption of equivalent resolutions in for example delaware companies additionally like other dutch companies our articles of association and our board charter contain controlenhancing rights that may have the effect of preventing discouraging or delaying a change of control 

 

if we were classified as a controlled foreign corporation any 10 us shareholders may be responsible for us income taxes on a prorata share of our income 

 

if the sum of the percentage ownership held by all of our 10 us shareholders as determined under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended “irc” exceeds 50 of our ordinary shares we would be classified as a controlled foreign corporation for us federal income tax purposes in the event such a classification were made all 10 us shareholders would be subject to taxation under subpart f of the irc which could require such 10 us shareholders to pay us federal income taxes on a pro rata portion of our income even in the absence of any distribution of such income 

based on information currently available to us we do not believe we are a controlled foreign corporation at this time 

 

us antiinversion rules may apply to lyondellbasell industries nv resulting in certain adverse us federal income tax consequences 

 

the united states internal revenue service “irs” could seek to apply section 7874 of the irc to treat lyondellbasell industries nv as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes or alternatively it could seek to impose us federal income tax on certain income of our us subsidiaries such an application would be based upon the value of stock issued in our emergence from chapter 11 that the former creditors and shareholders of our top us holding company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries received by reason of holding claims against those entities 

 

treatment as a us corporation could result in significantly increased us federal income tax liability to us application of the alternative could impose us federal income tax on our us subsidiaries 

 

although no assurance can be given that the irs would not take a contrary position regarding section 7874’s application or that such position if asserted would not be sustained we believe that the stock issued in connection with our emergence from the bankruptcy cases that is attributable to the value of the claims against our companies outside the us group makes a section 7874 inapplicable to us in addition we believe that strong arguments can be made that section 7874 should not in any event apply to us because of the substantial business activities that we and our affiliates conduct and have historically conducted in the netherlands

we emerged from bankruptcy on april 30 2010 as of that date all assets of the debtor entities vested in the reorganized debtor entities free and clear of all claims liens encumbrances charges and other interests except as provided in the plan of reorganization or the confirmation order entered on april 23 2010 the “confirmation order” except as otherwise expressly provided in the plan of reorganization or in the confirmation order on april 30 2010 each holder of a claim or equity interest is deemed to have forever waived released and discharged the debtor entities and the reorganized debtor entities to the fullest extent permitted by law of and from any and all claims equity interests rights and liabilities that arose prior to the confirmation date 

 

basf lawsuit 

 

on april 12 2005 basf filed a lawsuit against lyondell chemical in the superior court of new jersey morris county asserting various claims relating to alleged breaches of a propylene oxide toll manufacturing contract and seeking damages in excess of 100 million lyondell chemical denied breaching the contract and argued that at most it owed basf nothing more than a refund of 225 million which it has paid on 

august 13 2007 a jury returned a verdict in favor of basf in the amount of approximately 170 million inclusive of the 225 million refund on october 3 2007 the judge in the state court case determined that prejudgment interest on the verdict amounted to 36 million and issued a final judgment lyondell chemical appealed the judgment and has posted an appeal bond which is collateralized by a 200 million letter of credit 

 

on april 21 2010 oral arguments in the appeal were held before the appellate division and on december 28 2010 the judgment was reversed and the case remanded the parties have filed motions with the bankruptcy court for a determination as to whether the case will proceed in the bankruptcy court or new jersey state court we do not expect the ultimate resolution of this matter to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position liquidity or results of operations although it is possible that any such resolution could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation for any period in which a resolution occurs 

 

access indemnity demand 

 

on december 20 2010 one of our subsidiaries received demand letters from affiliates of access industries collectively “access” a more than five percent shareholder of the company we conducted an initial investigation of the facts underlying the demand letters and engaged in discussions with access we requested that access withdraw its demands with prejudice and on january 17 2011 access declined to withdraw the demands with or without prejudice 

 

specifically access affiliates nell limited “nell” and bi sárl “bi” have demanded that lyondellbasell industries holdings bv a whollyowned subsidiary of the company “lbih” indemnify them and their shareholders members affiliates officers directors employees and other related parties for all losses including attorney’s fees and expenses arising out of a pending lawsuit styled edward s weisfelner as litigation trustee of the lb litigation trust v leonard blavatnik et al  adversary proceeding no 091375 reg in the united states bankruptcy court southern district of new york 

 

in the weisfelner lawsuit the plaintiffs seek to recover damages from numerous parties including nell access and its affiliates the damages sought from nell access and its affiliates include among other things the return of all amounts earned by them related to their acquisition of shares of lyondell chemical company prior to its acquisition by basell af sca in december 2007 distributions by basell af sca to its shareholders before it acquired lyondell chemical company and management and transaction fees and expenses we cannot at this time determine the amount of liability if any that may be sought from lbih by way of indemnity if a judgment is rendered or a settlement is paid in the weisfelner lawsuit 

 

nell and bi have also demanded that lbih pay 50 million in management fees for the years 2009 and 2010 and that lbih pay other unspecified amounts relating to advice purportedly given in connection with financing and other strategic transactions 

 

nell and bi assert that lbih’s responsibility for indemnity and the claimed fees and expenses arises out of a management agreement entered into on december 11 2007 between nell and basell af sca they assert that lbih as a former subsidiary of basell af sca is jointly and severally liable for basell af sca’s obligations under the agreement notwithstanding that lbih was not a signatory to the agreement and the liabilities of basell af sca which was a signatory were discharged in the lyondellbasell bankruptcy proceedings 

 

we do not believe that the management agreement is in effect or that the company lbih or any other companyaffiliated entity owes any obligations under the management agreement we intend to defend vigorously any proceedings claims or demands that may be asserted 

 

environmental matters 

 

from time to time we and our joint ventures receive notices or inquiries from federal state or local governmental entities regarding alleged violations of environmental laws and regulations pertaining to among other things the disposal emission and storage of chemical and petroleum substances including hazardous 

wastes item 103 of the sec’s regulation sk requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and the proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that we reasonably believe could exceed 100000 the following matters pending as of december 31 2010 are disclosed in accordance with that requirement 

 

as part of the government settlement in the chapter 11 proceedings the us on behalf of epa was allowed a general unsecured claim of 499000 against millennium specialty chemicals inc and 480000 against houston refining lp these allowed claims settled the penalty amounts for alleged noncompliance based upon prepetition activities in the case of the houston refinery the allegations arise from a 2007 epa clean air act inspection in the case of millennium specialty chemicals epa conducted an inspection in 2008 at the colonels island georgia facility and questions were raised concerning handling of contaminated wastewater final resolution regarding these issues and any postpetition penalties is still subject to further negotiations with the government

tax impact of reorganization  — under the plan of reorganization lyondellbasell af’s prepetition debt securities revolving credit facility and other obligations were extinguished absent an exception a debtor recognizes cancellation of indebtedness income “codi” upon discharge of its outstanding indebtedness for an amount of consideration that is less than its adjusted issue price the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended “irc” provides that a debtor in a bankruptcy case may exclude codi from income but must reduce certain of its tax attributes by the amount of any codi realized as a result of the consummation of a plan of reorganization the amount of codi realized by a taxpayer is the adjusted issue price of any indebtedness discharged less the sum of i the amount of cash paid ii the issue price of any new indebtedness issued and iii the fair market value of any other consideration including equity issued as a result of the market value of our equity on the emergence date the estimated amount of codi exceeded the estimated amount of its tax attributes by approximately 7433 million the actual reduction in tax attributes does not occur until the first day of the subsequent tax year or january 1 2011 

 

as a result of tax attribute reduction we do not expect to retain any us net operating loss carryforwards alternative minimum tax credits or capital loss carryforwards in addition we expect that most if not all of our tax basis in depreciable assets will be eliminated accordingly it is expected that our liability for us income taxes in future periods will reflect these adjustments and our estimated cash tax liabilities for the years following 2010 will be significantly higher than in 2009 or 2010 this situation may be somewhat postponed by the temporary bonus depreciation provisions contained in the job creation act of 2010 which allows current year expensing for certain qualified acquisitions 

 

the company recorded its adjusted taxes in freshstart accounting without adjustment for estimated changes of tax attributes that could occur from may 1 2010 to january 1 2011 the date of actual reduction of tax attributes any adjustment to our tax attributes as a result of events or transactions that occurred during the period from may 1 2010 to december 31 2010 was reflected in the earnings of the successor company 

 

irc sections 382 and 383 provide an annual limitation with respect to the ability of a corporation to utilize its tax attributes as well as certain builtinlosses against future us taxable income in the event of a change in ownership the emergence from chapter 11 proceedings is considered a change in ownership for purposes of irc section 382 the limitation under the irc is based on the value of the corporation as of the emergence date we do not expect that the application of these limitations will have a material affect upon our us federal income tax liabilities germany has similar provisions that preclude the use of certain tax attributes generated prior to a change of control as of the emergence date the company had tax benefits associated with excess interest expense carryforwards of 16 million in germany that were eliminated as a result of the emergence the reversal of tax benefits associated with the loss of these carryforwards is reflected in the predecessor period 

 

our current and future provisions for income taxes are significantly impacted by the initial recognition of and changes in valuation allowances in certain countries and are dependent upon future earnings and earnings 

sustainability in those jurisdictions consequently our effective tax rate of 101 in the successor period is not indicative of future effective tax rates 

 

financial information  — following the completion of the bankruptcy cases lyondellbasell af’s equity interests in its indirect subsidiaries terminated and lyondellbasell nv the successor holding company now owns and operates directly and indirectly substantially the same business owned and operated by lyondellbasell af prior to emergence from bankruptcy for accounting purposes the operations of lyondellbasell af are deemed to have ceased on april 30 2010 and lyondellbasell nv is deemed to have begun operations on that date effective may 1 2010 we adopted freshstart accounting references in the following discussions to the “company” for periods prior to april 30 2010 the emergence date are to the predecessor company and for periods after the emergence date to the successor company 

 

the accompanying consolidated financial statements present separately the period prior to april 30 2010 and the period after emergence from bankruptcy to recognize the application of freshstart accounting management believes that combining the successor and predecessor periods for the year ended december 31 2010 which is a nongaap presentation provides a more meaningful comparison of the 2010 2009 and 2008 results of operations and cash flows when considered with the effects of freshstart accounting described below as a result we have combined the periods in our discussion to enable a more meaningful analysis of year over year results the effects of freshstart accounting are specifically addressed throughout the discussion to ensure a proper analysis references in the following discussion to results for the year ended december 31 2010 are to the combined successor and predecessor periods unless otherwise specifically described as successor or predecessor 

 

the primary impacts of our reorganization pursuant to the plan of reorganization and the adoption of freshstart accounting on our results of operations are as follows 

 

inventory  — we adopted the last in first out “lifo” method of accounting for inventory upon implementation of freshstart accounting prior to the emergence from bankruptcy lyondellbasell af used both the first in first out “fifo” and lifo methods of accounting to determine inventory cost for purposes of evaluating segment results management reviewed operating results for lyondellbasell af determined using current cost which approximates results using the lifo method of accounting for inventory subsequent to the emergence date our operating results are reviewed using the lifo method of accounting for inventory while determining the impact of the adoption of lifo on predecessor periods is not practicable we believe that the current cost method used by the predecessor for segment reporting is similar to lifo and the current cost method would have resulted in a decrease of cost of sales of 29 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2009 

 

in addition on april 30 2010 pursuant to asc topic 852 reorganizations  we recorded inventory at fair value the increase in inventory of 1297 million was primarily in the us and was largely driven by the price of crude oil the decline of the per barrel benchmark price of crude oil from 8615 at april 30 2010 to 7563 at june 30 2010 contributed to a 333 million lower of cost or market charge in the second quarter 2010 primarily to our raw materials and finished goods inventory in the third quarter 2010 lower market prices primarily for polypropylene resulted in an additional 32 million lower of cost or market charge to adjust the value of our finished goods inventory to market during the fourth quarter 2010 we recorded a 323 million noncash credit to reflect the market price recovery of wti crude oil substantially offsetting the second quarter 2010 lower of cost or market adjustment to our raw materials inventory the effect of these adjustments to the value of our inventory is reflected in cost of sales for the successor period 

 

depreciation and amortization expense  — depreciation and amortization expense is lower in the successor period as a result of our revaluation of assets for freshstart accounting for additional information on the 

revaluation of assets see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements depreciation and amortization as reported for all periods presented is as follows 

 

 

 

interest expense  — lower interest expense in the successor period was largely driven by the discharge or repayment of debt upon which interest was accruing during the bankruptcy through the company’s reorganization on april 30 2010 pursuant to the plan of reorganization partially offset by interest expense on the new debt incurred as part of the emergence from bankruptcy 

 

 

 

overview of results of operations 

 

2010 versus 2009  — global market conditions in 2010 improved from the weak conditions experienced throughout most of 2009 as demand in the durable goods sector particularly the automotive markets was higher than in 2009 as a result demand and operating rates were higher in 2010 than in 2009 in addition certain of our business segments benefited from planned and unplanned competitor operating disruptions particularly during the second quarter 2010 

 

excluding the impacts of freshstart accounting discussed above in “— emergence from chapter 11 proceedings” operating results in 2010 generally reflected higher product margins and higher sales volumes compared to 2009 reliable operations and the effect of industry supply disruptions resulted in higher product margins and higher sales volumes in the opamericas business segment higher operating results in the opeai and the id businesses were primarily a reflection of higher sales volumes and higher product margins due to improvement in the durable goods markets especially the automotive market the refining and oxyfuels business segment results were higher in 2010 primarily due to higher refining margins at the houston refinery lower licensing revenue contributed to lower results in the technology segment 

 

2009 versus 2008  — although global market conditions in 2009 improved compared to late 2008 compared to the full year 2008 market conditions in 2009 were significantly weaker demand was particularly weak in durable goods market sectors including housing and automotive markets similarly while industry operating rates and sales volumes improved during the course of 2009 compared to late 2008 for the full year 2009 they were below the levels experienced for the full year 2008 despite the significant decline in business activity late in 2008 

refining margins were significantly lower in 2009 as a result of weak demand for distillates such as diesel and heating oil heavy crude oil refining margins were also negatively affected by a contraction in the differential between the price of light and heavy crude oil after peaking at a recordsetting level in mid2008 prices for crude oil and ngls on average were significantly lower in 2009 in 2009 chemical product margins also generally declined because of the weaker pricing environment and lower average sales prices an exception was the us polyethylene market which experienced strong export demand and higher product margins during the latter half of 2009 

 

lyondellbasell af’s underlying operating results in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily reflected the negative effects of significantly lower product margins and sales volumes these were partly offset by the benefits of lower fixed costs strong margins for lyondellbasell af’s propylene oxide and advanced polyolefin products and higher us polyethylene margins a substantial portion of the lower product margins was due to refining operations while the lower sales volumes were concentrated in the base chemicals and polymers products and reflected the weakness in demand the lower fixed costs resulted from lyondellbasell af’s aggressive cost reduction program 

 

net income in 2009 also reflected charges related to lyondellbasell af’s planned reorganization under chapter 11 including professional fees write offs of plant asset values contract rejection claims employee severance costs and other costs associated with the chapter 11 proceedings and plant closures for a detailed description of reorganization charges see “results of operations” below 

 

net income in 2008 included charges for asset impairments reflecting declines in the value of inventory goodwill and other intangible assets as markets weakened and product sales prices and margins declined significantly at the end of 2008 

 

results of operations for the successor and predecessor periods discussed in these “results of operations” are presented in the table below 

 

 

 

segment operating results discussed below are reviewed for the successor period using the lifo method of accounting for inventory and were reviewed for the predecessor periods on a current cost basis 

results of operations 

 

revenues  — we had revenues of 41151 million in 2010 30828 million in 2009 and 50706 million in 2008 the 10323 million increase in 2010 compared to 2009 reflected higher demand resulting in higher average sales prices and higher sales volumes across most business segments partially offset by lower licensing revenue in the technology business segment higher crudeoil and natural gas prices also contributed to the increase in average sales prices in 2010 the 19878 million decrease in 2009 compared to 2008 reflected the effect of significantly lower sales prices and sales volumes due to lower crude oil and natural gas prices and weaker demand 

 

cost of sales  — cost of sales were 37102 million in 2010 29372 million in 2009 and 48780 million in 2008 

 

the 7730 million increase in cost of sales in 2010 was primarily due to higher raw material costs which reflect the effects of higher crude oil and natural gas liquidsbased raw material prices as well as the effect of higher sales volumes cost of sales in the successor period included a 64 million charge related to a change in estimate related to a dispute over environmental liability lower depreciation and amortization expense of 630 million due to the 7474 million writedown of property plant and equipment associated with the revaluation of our assets in freshstart accounting partially offset the higher costs in the successor period the predecessor period in 2010 included a charge of 23 million for plant closure and other costs related to a polypropylene plant in terni italy 

 

the 19408 million decrease in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to lower market prices for crude oil crude oilbased and natural gas liquids raw materials lower fixed and variable costs and lower sales volumes and operating rates reflecting the weak demand 

 

inventory valuation adjustment  — the company had noncash inventory valuation adjustments of 42 million 127 million and 1256 million in the 2010 successor period 2009 and 2008 respectively we recorded noncash charges in the 2010 successor period totaling 365 million to adjust the value of our raw materials and finished goods inventory to market as of june 30 2010 and september 30 2010 as discussed above these lower of cost or market charges were the result of the decline in the per barrel benchmark price of crude oil from the emergence date to june 30 2010 and lower market prices for certain products primarily polypropylene a noncash credit of 323 million recorded in the fourth quarter 2010 to reflect the recovery of market price substantially offset the lower of cost or market adjustment related to our raw materials inventory in 2009 and 2008 the company recorded charges of 127 million and 1256 million respectively to adjust the value of its inventory to market which was lower than the carrying value on december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

impairments  — impairments of 37 million 17 million and 5207 million were recognized by the company in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively in the 2010 successor period we recognized 28 million of impairment charges including a charge of 25 million related to impairment of the carrying value of assets at the berre refinery capital spending required for the operation of the berre refinery will continue to be impaired until such time as the discounted cash flow projections for the berre refinery are sufficient to recover the asset’s carrying amount in 2008 the company recognized charges of 4982 million and 225 million respectively for impairment of goodwill related to the december 20 2007 acquisition of lyondell chemical and the carrying value of its berre refinery 

 

sga expenses  — selling general and administrative “sga” expenses were 872 million in 2010 850 million in 2009 and 1197 million in 2008 the 347 million decrease in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily the result of lyondellbasell af’s 2009 cost reduction program and a favorable effect from changes in currency exchange rates currency exchange rates had a favorable effect on costs of nonus operations as the us dollar strengthened versus the euro in 2009 compared to 2008 sga expenses in 2008 included 564 million of lyondell chemical and berre refinery sga expense following their acquisitions by lyondellbasell af on december 20 2007 and april 1 2008 respectively 

 

operating income loss  — the company had operating income of 2944 million and 317 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively and an operating loss of 5928 million in 2008 the results of our underlying 

operations improved in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting higher product margins and the effect of higher sales volumes as demand increased due to improved global market conditions particularly in the first half of the year compared to the same periods in 2009 when demand was very weak operating results in the 2010 successor period benefited from lower depreciation and amortization expense of 651 million primarily due to the 7474 million writedown of property plant and equipment associated with the revaluation of our assets in freshstart accounting operating results in the 2010 successor period also included the negative impact of the 64 million noncash charge related to a dispute over environmental liability 

 

results in 2009 compared to 2008 reflected the benefits of the company’s cost reduction program offset by the unfavorable effects of lower product margins sales volumes and currency exchange rates on nonus operating income results in 2008 were impacted by charges of 4982 million and 225 million respectively for impairment of goodwill related to the december 20 2007 acquisition of lyondell chemical and the carrying value of the berre refinery and a charge of 1256 million to adjust inventory to market value 

 

operating results for each of our business segments are reviewed further in the “segment analysis” section below 

 

interest expense  — interest expense was 1258 million in 2010 1795 million in 2009 and 2476 million in 2008 interest expense was 537 million lower in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the repayment or discharge of debt on the emergence date in accordance with the plan of reorganization upon which interest was accruing during the bankruptcy and the repayment of 1233 million of debt in the fourth quarter 2010 this decrease in interest expense was partially offset by interest expense on the debt incurred as part of the emergence financing see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements and 26 million of charges related to the prepayment of 769 million of debt in december 2010 the prepayment of debt included 275 million of our 8 senior secured notes and 494 million of the senior secured term loan facility in december 2010 and 464 million under the accounts receivable securitization facility and accounts receivable factoring agreement during october and november of 2010 interest expense in 2009 was lower compared to 2008 primarily due to various debt instruments becoming subject to compromise as a result of the chapter 11 filing contractual interest expense for the predecessor periods was 2720 million for 2009 and 2476 million for 2008 

 

other income expense net  — the company had other expense net of 366 million in 2010 and other income net of 319 million and 106 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively other expense net in 2010 included the negative effect of the fair value adjustment of the warrants to purchase our shares of 114 million and foreign exchange losses of 240 million in 2009 and 2008 the company recognized involuntary conversion gains of 120 million and 79 million respectively representing partial insurance settlements of outstanding insurance claims related to damages sustained in 2005 at the polymers plant in münchsmünster germany and foreign exchange gains of 123 million and 20 million respectively as a result of changes in currency exchange rates other income net in 2009 also included benefits totaling 72 million resulting from indemnification payments received from previous plant owners for employee benefit and environmental remediation costs related to plant closures and a 15 million gain related to settlement of a uk pension claim 

 

income loss from equity investments  — the company had income from equity investments totaling 170 million in 2010 a loss from equity investments of 181 million in 2009 and income from equity investments of 38 million in 2008 the loss from equity investments in 2009 included a 228 million charge for impairment of the carrying value of the company’s investments in certain joint ventures income from equity investments in 2010 benefited from the operations of our saudi ethylene  polyethylene company ltd joint venture which commenced operations in june 2009 and from a new polypropylene plant operated by our hmc polymers company ltd joint venture that commenced operations in october 2010 

 

reorganization items  — the company had income from reorganization items totaling 7557 million in 2010 compared to reorganization expense of 2961 million in 2009 gains from reorganization items in 2010 included gains totaling 13617 million related to settlement of liabilities subject to compromise deconsolidation of entities upon emergence adjustments related to rejected contracts and a reduction of environmental 

remediation liabilities these gains were partially offset by a charge of 6086 million related to the changes in net assets resulting from the application of freshstart accounting and by several onetime emergence costs including the success and other fees earned by certain professionals upon the company’s emergence from bankruptcy damages related to the rejection of executory contracts and plant closure costs reorganization items expense in the 2010 successor period is primarily related to professional fees the 2009 period included charges for the write off of assets associated with a lease rejection damage claims related to certain executory contracts the net write off of unamortized debt issuance costs premiums and discounts environmental liabilities professional fees associated with the chapter 11 proceedings shutdown costs related primarily to the shutdown of its olefins plant at chocolate bayou texas and the longterm idling of its ethylene glycol facility in beaumont texas as well as employee severance and other costs for additional information on reorganization items see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

income tax  — in the eight months ended december 31 2010 the successor recorded a tax provision of 170 million representing an effective tax rate of 101 on pretax income of 1686 million in the four months ended april 30 2010 the predecessor recorded a tax benefit of 1123 million representing a negative effective tax rate of 152 on pretax income of 7383 million during 2009 the predecessor recorded a tax benefit of 1411 million representing an effective tax rate of 329 on a pretax loss of 4283 million the provision for the 2010 successor period differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the adjustment of various chapter 11 taxrelated assets the release of certain valuation allowances against our net operating loss carryforwards in the fourth quarter 2010 due to improved business results and the completion of a reorganization of our french subsidiaries the tax provision for the 2010 predecessor period differs from the statutory rate primarily because a significant portion of the pretax gain from the discharge of prepetition liabilities which was partially offset by restructuring charges for which no tax benefit was provided the tax benefit recorded for 2009 was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to restructuring costs for which no tax benefit was provided during 2008 lyondellbasell af had a tax benefit of 848 million on a pretax loss of 8191 million the effective income tax rate of 104 in 2008 primarily reflected the effect of goodwill impairment charges which are not deductible for tax purposes and the provision of valuation allowances in jurisdictions where future tax benefits are not expected to be realized 

 

income loss from continuing operations  — income from continuing operations was 10022 million in 2010 and losses from continuing operations were 2872 million in 2009 and 7343 million in 2008 the following table summarizes the major components contributing to the income loss from continuing operations 

 

 

 

in 2009 the loss from equity investments for the op — eai segment included charges of 228 million for impairment of the carrying value of the company’s equity investments in certain joint ventures see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

the table below summarizes some of the items of special note with regards to our income loss from continuing operations for the periods shown 

 

 

 

impairments in 2009 include an adjustment related to prior periods which increased income from operations and net income for the threemonth period ended december 31 2009 by 65 million the adjustment related to an overstatement of goodwill impairment in 2008 

 

income loss from discontinued operations net of tax  — the company had income from discontinued operations of 64 million in the 2010 successor period related to the sale of its flavor and fragrance chemicals business the company had a loss from discontinued operations in the 2010 predecessor period of 2 million and income from discontinued operations of 1 million and 15 million respectively in 2009 and 2008 related to the sale of a toluene diisocyanate business in september 2008 

 

fourth quarter 2010 versus third quarter 2010  — net income was 766 million in the fourth quarter 2010 compared to 467 million in the third quarter 2010 the 299 million increase in net income was primarily attributable to the release of nonus valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter 2010 a net benefit related to reorganization items attributable to events that occurred during the fourth quarter 2010 and the gain related to the sale of our flavor and fragrance chemicals business in december 2010 partially offset by lower operating results attributable to our opeai and technology segments discussed below the release of the nonus valuation allowances was due to improved business results and the completion of a reorganization of our french subsidiaries 

 

segment analysis 

 

our operations are primarily in five reportable segments op — americas op — eai id refining and oxyfuels and technology these operations comprise substantially the same businesses owned and operated by lyondellbasell af prior to the company’s emergence from bankruptcy however for accounting purposes the operations of lyondellbasell af are deemed to have ceased on april 30 2010 and lyondellbasell nv is deemed to have begun operations on that date the results of operations for the successor are not comparable to the predecessor due to adjustments made under freshstart accounting as 

described in “emergence from chapter 11 proceedings” the impact of these items is addressed in the discussion of each segment’s results below 

 

the following tables reflect selected financial information for our reportable segments operating income loss for segment reporting is on a lifo basis for the successor and on a current cost basis for the predecessor 

 

 

 

olefins and polyolefins — americas segment 

 

2010 versus 2009  — market demand in the us for ethylene was higher in 2010 compared to 2009 as a result of higher industry operating rates compared to rates experienced during 2009 ethylene margins were higher as benchmark sales prices increased significantly more than the benchmark weighted average costs of ethylene production sales of polyolefins in 2010 were comparable to 2009 although producers favored domestic market sales over exports due to improved domestic demand 

 

the op — americas segment operating results for 2010 primarily reflected strong demand and higher margins for ethylene due to improved economic conditions in 2010 and unplanned operating issues and turnarounds at competitor facilities in the first half of the year polypropylene results were also higher in 2010 compared to 2009 as domestic economic conditions improved demand for polyethylene in 2010 was comparable to 2009 operating results for the successor period reflected the impacts of the company’s reorganization and freshstart accounting including a noncash charge to adjust inventory to market value and the benefit of lower depreciation and amortization expense related to the writedown of segment assets see 

“results of operations — cost of sales” the net effect of these items contributed to the significantly improved results of operations in the 2010 successor periods compared to the twelve months of 2009 

 

2009 versus 2008  — while improving during the course of 2009 ethylene market demand in the us remained weak resulting in lower industry operating rates compared to rates in the 90 to 95 range during the first eight months of 2008 ethylene margins contracted as benchmark sales prices decreased more than the benchmark weighted average cost of ethylene production polyolefins markets were weaker in 2009 compared to 2008 with the notable exception of us polyethylene markets which benefited from strong export demand during 2009 

 

the op — americas segment operating results for 2009 primarily reflected the strong polyethylene “pe” export markets in 2009 lower olefins product margins and lower fixed costs as a result of weak ethylene demand during late 2008 and the first half of 2009 lyondellbasell af idled and subsequently shut down the chocolate bayou olefins plant near alvin texas lyondellbasell af also idled and subsequently restarted the la porte texas olefins plant in january 2009 strong pe export markets in 2009 benefited pe product margins and sales volumes however other polyolefins product markets were weaker and resulted in net lower sales volumes compared to 2008 as a result of lyondellbasell af’s cost reduction program fixed costs were significantly lower in 2009 compared to 2008 

 

in the third quarter 2008 operating results were negatively impacted by lost production at certain us gulf coast plants due to the effects of a hurricane 

 

ethylene raw materials — benchmark crude oil and natural gas prices generally have been indicators of the level and direction of the movement of raw material and energy costs for ethylene and its coproducts in the op — americas segment ethylene and its coproducts are produced from two major raw material groups 

 

  

although the prices of these raw materials are generally related to crude oil and natural gas prices during specific periods the relationships among these materials and benchmarks may vary significantly 

 

in the us we have a significant capability to shift the ratio of raw materials used in the production of ethylene and its coproducts to take advantage of the relative costs of heavy liquids and ngls 

 

in 2010 especially in the latter part of the year production economics for the industry favored ngls as a result we increased our use of ngls and reduced liquids consumption at our us plants during 2010 approximately 70 of our us ethylene production was produced from ngls 

 

the following table shows the average us benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas for the applicable periods as well as benchmark us sales prices for ethylene and propylene which we produce and sell or consume internally and certain polyethylene and polypropylene products the benchmark weighted 

average cost of ethylene production which is reduced by coproduct revenues is based on cmai’s estimated ratio of heavy liquid raw materials and ngls used in us ethylene production 

 

 

 

the following table sets forth the op — americas segment’s sales and other operating revenues operating income income from equity investments and selected product sales volumes 

 

 

 

revenues  — revenues in 2010 increased by 3975 million or 46 compared to 2009 primarily due to significantly higher overall average sales prices and higher ethylene and polypropylene sales volumes the increases in average sales prices and sales volumes in 2010 periods reflected an increase in demand resulting from improved economic conditions and the effect of constrained supply due to operating issues and turnarounds at competitor plants the decrease in 2009 revenue of 7798 million or 48 compared to 2008 reflected the effect of lower average product sales prices and net lower sale volumes net lower 2009 sales volumes reflected the effect of lower sales volumes for polypropylene and ethylene and coproducts partly offset by higher sales volumes for polyethylene which benefited from the strong us export markets 

 

operating income loss  — operating results for the op — americas segment reflected an increase of 1194 million in 2010 compared to 2009 and an increase of 1524 million in 2009 compared to 2008 the underlying operations of the op — americas segment in 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher product margins for ethylene as higher average sales prices for ethylene and its coproducts more than offset higher raw material costs in addition the effect of higher polypropylene sales volumes during 2010 partially offset the effect of higher utility planned maintenance and other costs operating results for 2010 were impacted by a noncash charge of 34 million to adjust inventory to market values lower depreciation 

and amortization expense of 204 million in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily the result of our writedown of property plant and equipment associated with the revaluation of our assets in freshstart accounting 

 

compared with 2008 the increase in the 2009 op — americas operating results reflected the benefit of lower fixed costs resulting from lyondellbasell af’s cost reduction program partially offset by net lower product margins and the effect of net lower sales volumes operating results for 2008 were negatively affected by the 120 million estimated impact of lost production due to hurricane ike and related costs of 39 million including a 7 million pretax charge for impairment of the carrying value of assets operating results for 2008 also included inventory valuation adjustments of 619 million and goodwill impairment charges of 624 million 

 

fourth quarter 2010 versus third quarter 2010  — the op — americas segment had operating income of 446 million in the fourth quarter 2010 compared to 448 million in the third quarter 2010 operating results in the fourth quarter 2010 included a noncash benefit of 163 million related to inventory market price recovery in the fourth quarter 2010 which partially offsets the charges recorded in the second and third quarters of 2010 of 171 million and 26 million respectively to adjust inventory to market value after the emergence date excluding the noncash inventory adjustment the decline in fourth quarter 2010 operating results was primarily due to a combination of lower product margins for polyethylene and polypropylene lower sales volumes and higher fixed costs polyethylene and polypropylene product margins declined as the increases in feedstock prices outpaced the increases in average sales price product margins for ethylene were comparable in the third and fourth quarters of 2010 the decrease in sales volumes was primarily related to the effects of seasonality as well as planned and unplanned outages during the fourth quarter 2010 fixed costs were higher in the fourth quarter 2010 compared to the third quarter 2010 primarily due to higher maintenance costs associated with the planned and unplanned outages and bonus expense 

 

olefins and polyolefins — europe asia and international segment 

 

2010 versus 2009  — ethylene market demand in europe was generally higher in 2010 compared to 2009 as planned and unplanned outages resulted in reduced supply and higher operating results in the second and third quarters of 2010 ethylene margins expanded as benchmark average sales prices increased more than the benchmark weighted average cost of ethylene production global polyolefin markets also improved in 2010 compared to 2009 the improvement in polypropylene and ldpe reflected tight supply conditions amid planned and unplanned industry outages throughout 2010 

 

the op — eai segment operating results for the 2010 periods reflected higher product margins for both olefins and polyolefins higher sales volumes for pp compounds and polypropylene in 2010 compared to 2009 reflect higher demand primarily from the automotive industry operating results for the successor period also reflected the impacts of freshstart accounting including the benefit of lower depreciation and amortization expense related to the writedown of segment assets see “results of operationscost of sales” 

 

2009 versus 2008  — while improving during the course of 2009 ethylene market demand in europe remained weak resulting in lower industry operating rates in the range of 75 to 80 compared to rates in the 85 to 90 range prior to the fourth quarter downturn in 2008 ethylene margins contracted as benchmark sales prices decreased more than the benchmark weighted average cost of ethylene production global polyolefin markets were considerably weaker in 2009 compared to 2008 the general weakness in global polyolefin markets resulted in lower sales volumes due to weaker demand particularly in polypropylene and lower product margins as selling prices decreased significantly 

 

the op — eai segment operating results for 2009 reflected the negative effects of significantly lower product margins compared to 2008 for olefins products while polyolefin product results for 2009 reflected generally weaker global polyolefin markets which resulted in lower sales volumes across all polyolefins product lines and net lower product margins compared to 2008 as a result of lyondellbasell af’s cost reduction program fixed costs were significantly lower in 2009 partly offsetting the negative effects of the weak markets 

ethylene raw materials — in europe heavy liquids are the primary raw materials for our ethylene production 

 

the following table shows the average west europe benchmark prices for brent crude oil a heavy liquid raw material for the applicable periods as well as benchmark west europe prices for ethylene and propylene which we produce and consume internally or purchase from unrelated suppliers and certain polyethylene and polypropylene products 

 

 

 

the following table sets forth the op — eai segment’s sales and other operating revenues operating income income from equity investments and selected product sales volumes 

 

 

 

revenues  — revenues for 2010 increased 3433 million or 37 compared to revenues for 2009 and revenues for 2009 decreased 4088 million or 30 compared to revenues for 2008 the increase in 2010 revenues compared to 2009 was primarily due to the effect of higher average product sales prices across most products particularly ethylene butadiene polyethylene and polypropylene as well as the effect of higher sales volumes particularly polypropylene including catalloy and pp compounds 

 

the decrease in 2009 revenues compared to 2008 reflected the effect of lower product sales prices and net lower sale volumes as well as the unfavorable effects of changes in currency exchange rates as the us dollar was stronger in relation to the euro in 2009 compared to 2008 lower 2009 polypropylene and ethylene coproduct sales volumes were partly offset by higher sales volumes for polyethylene and ethylene products 

 

operating income loss  — operating results for 2010 increased 528 million compared to 2009 and decreased 222 million for 2009 compared to 2008 the underlying operating results of our op — eai business segment were higher in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily as a result of higher product margins for ethylene butadiene polypropylene and polyethylene mainly ldpe fixed costs were also higher in 2010 

compared to 2009 reflecting costs related to our maintenance program and the start up of the polymers plant in münchsmünster germany operating results for 2010 were negatively impacted by a 35 million charge associated with a change in estimate related to a dispute that arose during the third quarter 2010 over an environmental indemnity lower depreciation and amortization expense of 62 million in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily a result of our writedown of property plant and equipment associated with the revaluation of our assets in freshstart accounting 

 

in 2009 the underlying operations of the op — eai segment reflected significantly lower net product margins and lower sales volumes primarily in europe offset by the benefit of lower fixed costs compared to 2008 the lower fixed costs were primarily a result of lyondellbasell af’s cost reduction program 

 

income loss from equity investments  — income from equity investments for the op — eai segment increased 320 million in 2010 compared to 2009 and decreased 206 million from 2008 to 2009 we received dividends of 40 million from our equity investments during 2010 the decrease from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to recognition of a 228 million aftertax impairment of the carrying value of lyondellbasell af’s investment in certain joint ventures during 2009 as a result of weak current and projected market conditions this loss was based on estimates of fair values developed in connection with lyondellbasell af’s estimation of its reorganization enterprise value 

 

fourth quarter 2010 versus third quarter 2010  — the op — eai segment had operating income of 66 million in the fourth quarter 2010 compared to 231 million in the third quarter 2010 underlying operating results reflected a decrease in the fourth quarter 2010 compared to the third quarter 2010 primarily due to lower product margins particularly ethylene and to a lesser extent higher fixed costs and the effect of lower sales volumes the lower product margins reflected higher raw material costs while the higher fixed costs resulted from higher costs related to our maintenance program the decrease in product margins was amplified by the unfavorable effects of changes in currency exchange rates as the euro weakened against the us dollar in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter 2010 operating results in the fourth quarter 2010 included an 10 million noncash credit related to inventory market price recovery in the fourth quarter 2010 which offsets the 5 million inventory adjustments recorded in each of the second and third quarters of 2010 to adjust inventory to market value after the emergence date operating results for the third quarter 2010 also included a 35 million charge associated with a change in estimate related to a dispute that arose during that period over an environmental liability 

 

intermediates and derivatives segment 

 

2010 versus 2009  — market demand for po and po derivatives improved in 2010 as the recovery of the automotive industry from a particularly weak 2009 and planned and unplanned industry outages during 2010 resulted in tightened supply demand in the intermediates market also returned to at or above prerecession levels 

 

the id segment’s operating results for 2010 primarily reflected higher sales volumes across most products compared to 2009 the propylene oxide business benefited from planned and unplanned competitor downtime in the first half of 2010 as the market for durable goods enduses strengthened operating results for the successor periods reflected the impacts of freshstart accounting including a noncash charge in the second quarter 2010 to adjust inventory to market value that was offset by the benefit of lower depreciation and amortization expense related to the writedown of segment assets see “results of operations — cost of sales” 

 

2009 versus 2008  — while improving during the course of 2009 markets for po and po derivatives ethylene derivatives and other intermediate chemical products generally experienced weaker demand in 2009 compared to 2008 particularly in durable goods markets 

 

the id segment operating results in 2009 primarily reflected the negative effects of lower sales volumes compared to 2008 as a result of lyondellbasell af’s cost reduction program fixed costs were significantly lower in 2009 partly offsetting the negative effects of the weak markets product margins were relatively stable in response to lower po demand lyondellbasell af temporarily idled two po facilities in late 2008 in midmay 2009 lyondellbasell af restarted one of the idled po facilities which is located in europe and 

is part of lyondellbasell af’s joint venture with bayer see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements the second po facility restarted in september 2009 

 

in the third quarter 2008 operating results were negatively impacted by lost production at certain us gulf coast plants due to the effects of a hurricane 

 

the following table sets forth the intermediates  derivatives segment’s sales and other operating revenues operating income income from equity investments and selected product sales volumes 

 

 

 

revenues  — revenues for 2010 increased 1796 million or 48 compared to 2009 and revenues for 2009 decreased 2440 million or 39 compared to revenues for 2008 the increase in revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 reflected increased demand in the current year leading to higher sales volumes and higher average sales prices across most products particularly po bdo pg tba and styrene eo and eg sales volumes were lower in 2010 due to planned and unplanned maintenance activities during the latter half of 2010 the decrease in 2009 revenue compared to 2008 reflected the effect of lower product sales prices and net lower sale volumes a trend which began in the latter part of 2008 in addition the unfavorable effects of changes in currency exchange rates contributed to the decrease in revenue as the us dollar was stronger in relation to the euro in 2009 compared to 2008 

 

operating income loss  — operating results for 2010 for the id segment increased 419 million compared to 2009 and increased 2165 for 2009 compared to 2008 operating results for 2010 include an 8 million noncash charge to adjust inventory at december 31 2010 to market value which was lower than the value at april 30 2010 applied during freshstart accounting lower depreciation and amortization expense of 104 million in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily the result of our writedown of property plant and equipment associated with the revaluation of our assets in freshstart accounting the remaining increases in 2010 primarily reflected the favorable effect of significantly higher sales volumes for po and po derivatives tba and styrene lower product margins for styrene and tba and derivatives more than offset higher product margins for acetyls eo and eg 

 

results in 2009 reflected lower fixed costs compared to 2008 as a result of lyondellbasell af’s cost reduction program and lower utility costs compared to 2008 due to lower natural gas prices product margins in 2009 were flat compared to 2008 as lower product prices were offset by lower raw material costs results in 2008 were impacted by charges of 1992 million for impairment of goodwill related to the december 20 2007 acquisition of lyondell chemical and inventory valuation adjustments of 65 million 

 

fourth quarter 2010 versus third quarter 2010  — the id segment had operating income of 196 million in the fourth quarter 2010 compared to 207 million in the third quarter 2010 operating results in the fourth quarter 2010 included a noncash benefit of 17 million related to inventory market price recovery in the fourth quarter 2010 which partially offsets the 25 million charge recorded in the second quarter 2010 to adjust inventory to market value after the emergence date the segment’s underlying fourth quarter 2010 

operating results reflect slightly lower product margins higher fixed costs the lower product margins primarily reflected higher raw material and utility costs 

 

refining and oxyfuels segment 

 

2010 versus 2009  — in 2010 compared to 2009 benchmark heavy crude refining margins averaged higher primarily due to an increase in the differential between the cost of heavy and light crude oil 

 

segment operating results in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily reflected higher benchmark refining margins and lower crude processing rates at the houston refinery crude processing rates for the houston refinery reflected the effects of a crude unit fire sulfur recovery constraints and unplanned outages while the berre refinery crude processing rates were negatively affected by national strikes in france during the fourth quarter 2010 oxyfuels results were lower in 2010 operating results for the successor period reflected the impacts of freshstart accounting including noncash charges in the second and third quarters of 2010 to adjust inventory to market value all of which was recovered in the fourth quarter 2010 and the benefit of lower depreciation and amortization expense related to the writedown of segment assets see “results of operations — cost of sales” 

 

2009 versus 2008  — benchmark refining margins for 2009 were lower compared to the same period in 2008 generally reflecting the weaker global economy and consequent weaker demand for gasoline and distillate products such as diesel and heating oil the weaker demand resulted in lower prices for light crude oil while opecmandated production cuts resulted in lower supplies of heavy crude oil and lower price discounts relative to light crude oil both factors compressed the price differential between light and heavy crude oil benchmark margins for oxyfuels in 2009 were comparable to 2008 

 

refining and oxyfuels segment operating results in 2009 primarily reflected the effects of significantly lower us refining margins compared to the same period in 2008 the operating results of the berre refinery which was acquired on april 1 2008 reflected the weak distillate markets in 2009 operating results in 2009 benefited from higher margins for oxygenated gasoline blending components and lower utility and fixed costs but were negatively affected by outages of some of the houston refinery’s sulfur recovery units during the second quarter 2009 and of a crude unit during the fourth quarter 2009 as a result of lyondellbasell af’s cost reduction program fixed costs were significantly lower in 2009 compared to 2008 

 

in 2008 operating results were negatively impacted by lost production at the houston refinery due to the effects of a hurricane and a scheduled maintenance turnaround of one of the refinery’s crude trains and coker units during the third quarter 2008 that was delayed by an incident involving a contractor’s crane and an unplanned second quarter 2008 outage of a fcc unit 

 

the following table sets forth the refining and oxyfuels segment’s sales and other operating revenues operating income and sales volumes for certain gasoline blending components for the applicable periods in addition the table shows market refining margins for the us and europe and mtbe margins in northwest 

europe “nwe” in the us “wti” or west texas intermediate is a light crude oil while “maya” is a heavy crude oil in europe “urals — 4121” is a measure of west european refining margins 

 

 

 

 

  

revenues  — revenues for the refining and oxyfuels segment increased 2991 million or 25 in 2010 compared to 2009 and decreased 6284 million or 34 from 2008 to 2009 the increase in revenues from 2009 to 2010 is primarily due to higher average sales prices at the houston and berre refineries crude processing rates for the houston refinery were 3 lower compared to 2009 as a result of a may 2010 crude unit fire and other planned and unplanned outages during 2010 crude processing rates for the berre refinery were 2 higher in 2010 compared to 2009 despite several planned and unplanned outages 

 

the decrease in revenues in 2009 from 2008 was primarily due to lower sales prices partially offset by higher sales volumes at the houston refinery the decrease during 2009 was partially offset by the effect of a full year of operation of the berre refinery which was acquired april 1 2008 

 

operating income loss  — operating results increased 499 million in 2010 compared to 2009 and increased 2021 million in 2009 compared to 2008 operating results in 2010 were negatively impacted by a 21 million charge associated with a change in estimate related to a dispute that arose during the third quarter 2010 over an environmental indemnity the impairment of assets related to the berre refinery and by a crude unit fire in may 2010 resulting in lost production and 14 million in cash costs operating results for 2009 included the benefit of 50 million from the settlement of hedging activity at the houston refinery related to distillates lower depreciation and amortization expense of 269 million in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily the result of the writedown of property plant and equipment associated with the revaluation of our assets in freshstart accounting apart from the effects of the items listed above increases in operating results for 2010 were primarily due to higher refining margins especially at the houston refinery partially offset by lower product margins for oxyfuels the decreased oxyfuels margins in 2010 are primarily due to the normalization of margins in 2010 compared to the exceptional margins achieved in 2009 

operating results in 2009 were negatively affected by lower crude refining margins partially offset by lower utility costs due to lower natural gas prices and lower fixed costs the latter reflected lyondellbasell af’s cost reduction program the lower refining margins were primarily attributable to us refining markets although margins were lower for both the houston and berre refineries in 2008 operating results were negatively impacted by scheduled maintenance turnarounds of crude and coker units and the related july 2008 crane incident at the houston refinery as well as by operating disruptions related to hurricane ike by an estimated 205 million in addition to the turnaround and hurricane effects operating results were negatively affected by an estimated 220 million as a result of lost production due to unplanned maintenance at the houston refinery’s fcc and other operating units operating results were also negatively impacted by impairment charges against goodwill of 2305 million and other assets of 218 million and inventory valuation adjustments of 442 million 

 

fourth quarter 2010 versus third quarter 2010 — the refining and oxyfuels segment had operating income of 144 million in the fourth quarter 2010 compared to 83 million in the third quarter 2010 operating results in the fourth quarter 2010 reflect the noncash benefit of 132 million related to inventory market price recovery which offsets the lower of cost or market charges recorded in the second and third quarters of 2010 of 132 million and 1 million respectively and the impairment of assets related to the berre refinery third quarter 2010 operating results include the 21 million charge associated with a change in estimate related to a dispute over an environmental indemnity the underlying operating results of the refining and oxyfuels business segment decreased in the fourth quarter 2010 primarily due to lower overall sales volumes partially offset by higher refining margins at both the houston and berre refineries crude processing rates for the houston refinery were 11 lower compared to the third quarter 2010 reflecting the effect of unplanned outages during the fourth quarter while crude processing rates in the fourth quarter 2010 for the berre refinery were only slightly lower compared to the third quarter 2010 refining margins during the fourth quarter reflected the effect of higher average sales prices resulting from in the case of the berre refinery the disruption due to the national strikes in france normal seasonal declines affected oxyfuels product margins and sales volumes during the fourth quarter 2010 the seasonal decline in margins was steeper than usual as the price of feedstocks butane and ethanol rose rapidly due to cold weather and a poor grain harvest respectively 

 

technology segment 

 

2010 versus 2009  — the technology segment results in 2010 were negatively impacted by lower licensing revenue reflecting a slowdown in new polyolefin projects as a consequence of the economic crisis beginning late in the fourth quarter 2008 higher sales volumes for catalysts partially offset the results for process licenses the negative effect of a strengthening us dollar versus the euro in 2010 also negatively impacted the technology segment’s 2010 results 

 

2009 versus 2008  — technology segment results for 2009 were primarily affected by lower license revenue reflecting weaker global markets compared to 2008 the segment results also reflected the negative effects of changes in currency exchange rates as the us dollar strengthened versus the euro the 2009 results benefited from lower rd expense reflecting lyondellbasell af’s cost reduction program and a government subsidy and the effects of higher catalyst sales volumes 

 

the following table sets forth the technology segment’s sales and other operating revenues and operating income 

 

 

revenues  — revenues for 2010 decreased 33 million or 6 compared to 2009 and decreased 40 million or 7 from 2008 to 2009 the decreases in 2010 and 2009 revenues were attributable to lower process license revenue partially offset by higher catalyst sales volumes in addition currency exchange rates had an unfavorable effect on operating income of nonus operations as the us dollar strengthened versus the euro in both periods 

 

operating income  — operating income for 2010 for the technology segment decreased 102 million compared to 2009 and increased 8 million from 2008 to 2009 operating income for 2010 was negatively affected by an 8 million charge associated with a change in estimate related to a dispute that arose during the third quarter 2010 over an environmental indemnity and by a 17 million charge related to the sale in 2010 of higher cost inventory the remaining decrease in operating income in 2010 compared to 2009 was the result of lower licensing revenue and to a lesser extent the negative effects of a strengthening us dollar versus the euro in 2010 compared to 2009 these decreases in 2010 operating results were only partly offset by the effect of increased catalyst sales volumes in 2010 operating income in 2009 also included the benefit of a government subsidy recognized as a reduction of rd expense 

 

the 8 million increase in operating income in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily the result of higher catalysts sales volumes partly offset by an unfavorable effect from changes in currency exchange rates currency exchange rates had an unfavorable effect on operating income as the us dollar strengthened versus the euro in 2009 compared to 2008 

 

fourth quarter 2010 versus third quarter 2010  — the technology segment had operating income of 8 million in the fourth quarter 2010 compared to 38 million in the third quarter 2010 apart from a fourth quarter 2010 charge of 17 million related to the sale of higher cost inventory during the year and an 8 million charge related to a dispute over environmental liability operating results in the fourth quarter 2010 reflected lower licensing income and the effect of lower sales volumes for catalysts compared to the third quarter 2010 

 

financial condition 

 

operating investing and financing activities of continuing operations which are discussed below are presented in the following table 

 

 

 

operating activities  — cash provided in the combined successor and predecessor periods of 2010 primarily reflected an increase in earnings offset by payments for reorganization items claims under the plan of reorganization and certain annual payments relating to sales rebates employee bonuses property taxes and insurance premiums the use of cash in 2009 primarily reflected a 573 million increase in cash used by the main components of working capital — accounts receivable and inventory net of accounts payable — and 329 million of vendor prepayments that were required by certain third parties as a result of lyondellbasell af’s chapter 11 filing 

 

in 2010 the main components of working capital — accounts receivable and inventory net of accounts payable used cash of 456 million compared to 573 million in 2009 the increase in these components of working capital during 2010 reflected a 702 million increase in accounts receivable due to higher average sales prices and higher sales volumes and a 395 million increase in inventory partially offset by a 

641 million increase in accounts payable due to the higher costs and volumes of feedstocks and more favorable payment terms 

 

changes in the main components of working capital used cash of 573 million in 2009 and provided cash of 747 million in 2008 the increase in cash used by the main components of working capital in 2009 primarily reflected a 503 million repayment that was required in connection with the termination of an accounts receivable securitization program in early 2009 operationally cash used by the main components of working capital increased by only 70 million despite the effect of rising prices during 2009 as the company focused on reducing working capital levels 

 

in 2008 the 747 million of cash provided by the main components of working capital primarily reflected the effects of declining crude oil prices on sales prices and the value of inventory the disruptive effects of hurricane ike on the company’s gulf coast operations and the planned and unplanned outages related to a turnaround at the houston refinery other factors impacting the main components of working capital included a general tightening of credit in the industry and the delay in december 2008 of certain payments 

 

investing activities  — cash used in investing activities in 2010 included 692 million of capital expenditures partially offset by proceeds of 154 million from the sale of our ff business in december 2010 and 12 million in proceeds from a money market fund that had suspended rights to redemption in 2008 as described below 

 

the cash used in 2009 primarily included 779 million of capital expenditures partially offset by proceeds of 120 million from insurance claims 20 million from sales of assets and 23 million from a net reduction of shortterm investments the cash provided by insurance claims related to damages sustained in 2005 at the polymers plant in münchsmünster germany 

 

the cash used in 2008 was primarily related to business acquisitions and capital expenditures partially offset by proceeds from the sales of assets and insurance claims related to the polymers plant in münchsmünster germany acquisitions in 2008 included the april 2008 acquisition of the shell oil refinery inventory and associated infrastructure and businesses at our berre refinery for a purchase price of 927 million including final adjustment for working capital and the february 2008 acquisition of solvay engineered polymers inc a leading supplier of polypropylene compounds in north america for 134 million see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements asset sales included the september 2008 sale of the tdi business for proceeds of €77 million 113 million and the july 2008 sale of a canadian plant for proceeds of 18 million as a result of financial difficulties experienced by major financial institutions beginning in the latter part of 2008 lyondellbasell af received notice that rights of redemption had been suspended with respect to a money market fund in which lyondellbasell af had invested approximately 174 million lyondellbasell af subsequently redeemed a total of 172 million including 137 million in 2008 23 million in 2009 and 12 million in january 2010 

the following table summarizes capital expenditures for the periods presented 

 

 

 

the capital expenditures presented in the table above exclude costs of major periodic maintenance and repair activities including turnarounds and catalyst recharges of 71 million 39 million and 164 million in the predecessor periods of 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

financing activities  — the cash used in the successor period primarily reflects the repayment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2010 in december 2010 we redeemed 225 million and €375 million 50 million of our 8 senior secured notes due 2017 comprising 10 of the outstanding senior secured dollar notes and senior secured euro notes respectively in conjunction with the redemption of the notes we paid premiums totaling 8 million also in 2010 we repaid 495 million of the senior term loan facility including a mandatory quarterly amortization payment of 1 million and a prepayment at par of 494 million in december 2010 

 

since the emergence date we made net payments totaling 398 million under the european securitization facility which includes the entire outstanding balance in october 2010 we also made net payments of 14 million under our accounts receivable factoring facility during the successor period 

 

as part of our emergence from bankruptcy we received gross proceeds of 2800 million on april 30 2010 in connection with the issuance of shares in a rights offering and paid 86 million of fees including 70 million of fees to equity backstop providers on april 30 2010 we also received net proceeds of 3242 million from the issuance of new debt by our subsidiary lyondell chemical including senior secured notes in the amounts of 2250 million and €375 million 497 million and from proceeds of the senior term loan facility of 495 million proceeds from the rights offering and the senior notes along with borrowings under the senior term loan facility and the amended and restated european securitization were used to repay outstanding amounts of 2167 million under the dip new money term loan 985 million under the dip abl facility and to pay a 195 million exit fee required under the dip financing we also paid fees totaling 92 million in connection with our new us abl facility and amended and restated european securitization facility predecessor debt classified as liabilities subject to compromise immediately prior to emergence from bankruptcy was discharged pursuant to the plan of reorganization see note 4 to consolidated financial statements 

 

apart from the payments reflected above during the 2010 predecessor period we repaid a 5 million argentinean loan made a 12 million mandatory quarterly amortization payment of the dutch tranche a dollar term loan 3 million of which was related to the dip rollup loans and made payments of 

8 million on the french factoring facility in addition we made payments totaling 13 million related to the extension of the dip financing we also had a net increase in borrowings of 47 million under the european securitization facility in the 2010 predecessor period 

 

in 2009 lyondellbasell af borrowed 2167 million under a dip financing arrangement receiving net proceeds of 2089 million and subsequently paid additional bank fees of 97 million in addition lyondellbasell af paid fees of 93 million related to the issuance of the dip abl facility and at december 31 2009 had 325 million of net borrowings outstanding under this facility 

 

the chapter 11 filing in 2009 constituted a termination event under the assetbased credit facilities in the us and lyondellbasell af used 880 million of the net proceeds under the dip financing arrangement to repay 766 million and 114 million outstanding under the previous inventorybased credit facility and the north american accounts receivable securitization program respectively as noted under operating activities lyondellbasell af also used 503 million to repurchase outstanding accounts receivable sold under its previous 1150 million receivables securitization facility in addition lyondellbasell af repaid a 100 million demand note related to emergency postpetition funding in 2009 lyondellbasell af made net repayments totaling 201 million under its european receivables securitization program which was amended and restated in march 2009 lyondellbasell af repaid 45 million 70 million australian dollars outstanding under an australian term loan and 11 million of other loans including 6 million outstanding under an argentinean bank loan and made mandatory quarterly amortization payments of the dutch tranche a dollar term loan totaling 24 million 6 million of which was related to the dip financing 

 

a nondebtor subsidiary of lyondellbasell af entered into an accounts receivable factoring agreement in 2009 under which it received 24 million of proceeds see the “accounts receivable factoring agreement” section in “liquidity and capital resources” also in 2009 lyondellbasell af received 18 million of proceeds from an argentinean bank loan and borrowed 17 million related to a letter of credit presented for payment under the prepetition senior secured revolving credit facility 

 

lyondellbasell af had an additional 21 million of cash used by financing activities primarily related to the effects of bank overdrafts 

 

the cash provided in 2008 primarily reflected net 1510 million borrowed under lyondellbasell af’s credit facilities offset by 384 million of longterm debt repayments the borrowings were used to fund the business acquisitions described in the “investing activities” section above 

 

liquidity and capital resources  — as of december 31 2010 we had cash on hand of 4222 million in addition we had total unused availability under our credit facilities of 1883 million at december 31 2010 which included the following 

 

  

in october 2010 we provided the lenders under our accounts receivable factoring facility with notice of our intent to terminate the agreement the facility was repaid in full in november 2010 and terminated 

 

we may use cash on hand cash from operating activities and proceeds from asset divestitures to repay debt which may include additional purchases of our outstanding bonds in the open market or otherwise we also plan to finance our ongoing working capital capital expenditures debt service and other funding requirements through our future financial and operating performance which could be affected by general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory business and other factors many of which are beyond 

our control we believe that our cash cash from operating activities and proceeds from our revolving credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due 

 

at december 31 2010 we had total shortterm and longterm debt including current maturities of 6082 million at december 31 2010 our 4 million of current maturities of longterm debt comprises various nonus loans 

 

we are seeking to amend and restate our senior secured term loan agreement to among other things modify certain restrictive covenants 

 

receivables securitization  — on may 4 2010 we amended and restated an existing securitization agreement under which two of our nonus subsidiaries may sell subject to a borrowing base up to €450 million in trade receivables transfers of accounts receivable under this threeyear program do not qualify as sales therefore the transferred accounts receivable and the proceeds received through such transfers are included in trade receivables net and shortterm debt in the consolidated balance sheets there were no borrowings under this facility as of december 31 2010 

 

contractual and other obligations  — the following table summarizes as of december 31 2010 our minimum payments for longterm debt including current maturities shortterm debt and contractual and other obligations for the next five years and thereafter 

 

 

 

total debt  — total debt includes our 8 us dollar and euro senior secured notes due 2017 senior secured term loan facility due 2016 11 senior secured notes due 2018 81 guaranteed notes due 2027 the “2027 notes” and various nonus loans see note 15 for a discussion of covenant requirements under the credit facilities and indentures and additional information regarding our debt facilities 

 

interest  — our debt and related party debt agreements contain provisions for the payment of monthly quarterly or semiannual interest at a stated rate of interest over the term of the debt 

 

pension benefits  — we maintain several defined benefit pension plans as described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2010 the projected benefit obligation for our pension plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by 1173 million subject to future actuarial gains and losses as well as actual asset earnings we together with our consolidated subsidiaries will be required to fund the 

1173 million with interest in future years we contributed 99 million to our pension plans in 2010 and lyondellbasell af made contributions to the plans of 52 million in 2009 and 80 million in 2008 in january 2011 we contributed 155 million of the approximately 287 million of required contributions that we expect to make to our pension plans in 2011 estimates of pension benefit payments through 2015 are included in the table above 

 

other postretirement benefits  — we provide other postretirement benefits primarily medical benefits to eligible participants as described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements we pay other unfunded postretirement benefits as incurred estimates of other postretirement benefit payments through 2015 are included in the table above 

 

advances from customers  — we are obligated to deliver product primarily at costbased prices in connection with longterm sales agreements under which our predecessor received advances from customers in prior years these advances are treated as deferred revenue and will be amortized to earnings as product is delivered over the remaining terms of the respective contracts which primarily range from 4 to 8 years the unamortized longterm portion of such advances totaled 101 million as of december 31 2010 

 

other  — other primarily consists of accruals for environmental remediation costs obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and anticipated asset retirement obligations see “critical accounting policies” below for a discussion of obligations for environmental remediation costs 

 

deferred income taxes  — the scheduled settlement of the deferred tax liabilities shown in the table is based on the scheduled reversal of the underlying temporary differences actual cash tax payments will vary depending upon future taxable income 

 

purchase obligations  — we are party to various obligations to purchase products and services principally for raw materials utilities and industrial gases these commitments are designed to assure sources of supply and are not expected to be in excess of normal requirements the commitments are segregated into takeorpay contracts and other contracts under the takeorpay contracts we are obligated to make minimum payments whether or not we take the product or service other contracts include contracts that specify minimum quantities however in the event that we do not take the contractual minimum we are only obligated for any resulting economic loss suffered by the vendor the payments shown for the other contracts assume that minimum quantities are purchased for contracts with variable pricing terms the minimum payments reflect the contract price at december 31 2010 

 

operating leases  — we lease various facilities and equipment under noncancelable lease arrangements for various periods see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for related lease disclosures 

 

related party transactions 

 

we have related party transactions with certain of our major shareholders and their affiliates and our joint venture partners we believe that such transactions are effected on terms substantially no more or less favorable than those that would have been agreed upon by unrelated parties on an arm’s length basis 

 

lyondellbasell af had related party transactions with its equity investees and its affiliates as well as a member of its board of directors see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in addition prior to the emergence date lyondellbasell af had related party transactions with access industries 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

management applies those accounting policies that it believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the us see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements our more critical accounting policies include those related to the valuation of inventory longlived assets the valuation of goodwill accruals for longterm employee benefit costs such as pension and other postretirement costs liabilities for anticipated expenditures to comply with environmental regulations and accruals for taxes based on income inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management management periodically updates its estimates used in the preparation of the 

financial statements based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment changes to these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with lyondellbasell nv’s supervisory board 

 

inventory  — lyondellbasell nv adopted the lifo method of accounting for inventory upon implementation of freshstart accounting in conjunction with the implementation of freshstart accounting on april 30 2010 the company recorded its inventory which is primarily crudeoil derived at fair value the resulting increase in inventory was primarily in the us and was largely driven by the price of crude oil the per barrel benchmark price of wti crude oil at april 30 2010 had increased to 8615 the price of crude oil is subject to many factors including changes in economic conditions the fluctuation in the price of crude oil from period to period may result in the recognition of charges to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in periods of falling prices and the reversal of those charges in subsequent periods as market prices recover accordingly our cost of sales and results of operations may be affected by such fluctuations 

 

following the revaluation of our inventory on april 30 2010 the per barrel benchmark price of wti crude oil declined to 7563 on june 30 2010 resulting in a 333 million lower of cost or market adjustment primarily to the company’s raw materials and finished goods inventory and associated increase in cost of sales for the period from may 1 through june 30 2010 in the third quarter 2010 as a result of lower market prices for certain of the company’s finished goods inventory the company recorded a noncash charge of 32 million to adjust the value to the lower of cost or market the recovery of the market price of crude oil in the fourth quarter of 2010 resulted in a noncash credit of 323 million to earnings 

 

longlived assets  — with respect to longlived assets key assumptions included the estimates of the asset fair values and useful lives at the emergence date and the recoverability of carrying values of fixed assets and other intangible assets as well as the existence of any obligations associated with the retirement of fixed assets such estimates could be significantly modified andor the carrying values of the assets could be impaired by such factors as new technological developments new chemical industry entrants with significant raw material or other cost advantages uncertainties associated with the european us and world economies the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries and uncertainties associated with governmental actions whether regulatory or in the case of houston refinery with respect to its crude oil contract 

 

earnings in the 2010 successor period included a pretax charge of 28 million primarily related to impairment of the carrying value of capital additions at our berre refinery following an analysis of its discounted cash flow projections 

 

predecessor earnings for 2009 included pretax impairment charges of 17 million primarily related to the impairment of lyondellbasell af’s emissions allowances that are subject to reallocation to other industry participants under a proposed regulation by the texas commission on environmental quality as part of its reorganization lyondellbasell af also recognized charges totaling 679 million including 624 million for the write off of the carrying value and related assets of its chocolate bayou olefins facility near alvin texas and 55 million for the write off of its ethylene glycol facility in beaumont texas 

 

predecessor earnings for 2008 included a 218 million pretax charge for impairment of the carrying value of the assets related to lyondellbasell af’s berre refinery also in 2008 lyondellbasell af recognized a 7 million charge for impairment of its ethylene glycol facility in beaumont texas 

 

for purposes of recognition and measurement of the abovenoted impairments longlived assets were grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows were largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

 

the estimated useful lives of longlived assets range from 3 to 30 years depreciation and amortization of these assets including amortization of deferred turnaround costs under the straightline method over their estimated useful lives totaled 1123 million in 2010 including 558 million in the successor period based upon the estimated fair values and reassessed useful lives at the emergence date depreciation and amortization would be approximately 850 million per year if the useful lives of the assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated depreciation and amortization charges would be accelerated over the revised useful life 

goodwill  — goodwill of 787 million at december 31 2010 represents the tax effect of the differences between the tax and book bases of the company’s assets and liabilities resulting from the company’s revaluation of those assets and liabilities to fair value in connection with the company’s emergence from bankruptcy and adoption of freshstart accounting lyondellbasell nv evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value recoverability is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill applies to the carrying value including goodwill of that reporting unit 

 

the recoverability of lyondellbasell nv’s goodwill is dependent upon the future operating results associated with its reporting units which could change significantly based upon business performance or other factors 

 

longterm employee benefit costs  — the costs to lyondellbasell nv of longterm employee benefits particularly pension and other postretirement medical and life insurance benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is management’s responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent its best estimates of the future effects of those uncertainties it also is management’s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 

 

the current benefit service costs as well as the existing liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis the discount rate is a current rate related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled lyondellbasell nv’s assumed discount rate is based on published average rates for highquality aa rating tenyear fixed income securities for the purpose of measuring the benefit obligations at december 31 2010 lyondellbasell nv used a discount rate of 525 for most us plans while a rate of 50 was used for certain us plans to reflect the different terms of the related benefit obligations the discount rate used to measure obligations for nonus plans at december 31 2010 was 497 reflecting market interest rates the discount rates in effect at december 31 2010 will be used to measure net periodic benefit cost during 2011 

 

the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of other postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits as of december 31 2010 the assumed rate of increase for our us plans was 91 decreasing to 5 in 2026 and thereafter the assumed rate of increase for our canadian plans as of december 31 2010 was 85 decreasing to 5 in 2018 and thereafter a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate assumption would have no significant effect on either the benefit liability or the net periodic cost due to limits on lyondellbasell nv’s maximum contribution level under the medical plan 

 

the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption investment returns that are recognized currently in net income represent the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets applied to a marketrelated value of plan assets which for lyondellbasell nv is defined as the market value of assets the expected rate of return on plan assets is a longer term rate and is expected to change less frequently than the current assumed discount rate reflecting longterm market expectations rather than current fluctuations in market conditions 

 

the weighted average expected longterm rate of return on us and nonus plan assets of 8 and 624 respectively is based on the average level of earnings that its independent pension investment advisor had advised could be expected to be earned over time the expectation is based on an asset allocation that varies by region the asset allocations are summarized in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements the actual returns in 2010 for us and non us plan assets were 156 and 84 respectively 

 

the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets management’s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 

net periodic pension cost recognized each year includes the expected asset earnings rather than the actual earnings or loss this unrecognized amount to the extent it exceeds 10 of the projected benefit obligation for the respective plan is recognized as additional net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service period of the participants in each plan 

 

in may 2010 lyondellbasell nv resumed matching contributions under its defined contribution plans the 401k employee savings plans lyondellbasell af had temporarily suspended its matching contributions under the company’s defined contribution plans beginning in march 2009 as a result of the bankruptcy 

 

additional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

liabilities for environmental remediation costs  — anticipated expenditures related to investigation and remediation of contaminated sites which include current and former plant sites and other remediation sites are accrued when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated only ongoing operating and monitoring costs the timing of which can be determined with reasonable certainty are discounted to present value future legal costs associated with such matters which generally are not estimable are not included in these liabilities 

 

as of december 31 2010 lyondellbasell nv’s accrued liability for future environmental remediation costs at current and former plant sites and other remediation sites totaled 107 million the liabilities for individual sites range from less than 1 million to 37 million and remediation expenditures are expected to occur over a number of years and not to be concentrated in any single year in the opinion of management it is reasonably possible that losses in excess of the liabilities recorded for environmental remediation may have been incurred however we cannot estimate any amount or range of such possible additional losses new information about sites new technology or future developments such as involvement in investigations by regulatory agencies could require lyondellbasell nv to reassess potential exposure related to environmental matters see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of environmental remediation matters 

 

accruals for taxes based on income  — the determination of our provision for income taxes and the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities is subject to management’s estimates and judgments due to the complexity of the tax laws and regulations in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of these complex laws and regulations 

 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 

 

we recognize future tax benefits to the extent that the realization of these benefits is more likely than not our current provision for income taxes was impacted significantly by the initial recognition of valuation allowances related to net deferred assets in certain nonus jurisdictions further changes to these valuation allowances may impact our future provision for income taxes which will include no tax benefit with respect to losses incurred and no tax expense with respect to income generated in these countries until the respective valuation allowance is eliminated 

 

for further information related to our income taxes see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements of lyondellbasell nv for the year ended december 31 2010 see note 24 to lyondellbasell af’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2009 for further information related to income taxes in the predecessor periods

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of lyondellbasell nv’s management of commodity price risk foreign currency exposure and interest rate risk through its use of derivative instruments and hedging activities 

 

commodity price risk 

 

a substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change accordingly product margins and the level of our profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the business cycle we try to protect against such instability through various business strategies these include provisions in sales contracts allowing us to pass on higher raw material costs through timely price increases formula price contracts to transfer or share commodity price risk and increasing the depth and breadth of our product portfolio 

 

in addition we selectively use commodity swap option and futures contracts with various terms to manage the volatility related to purchases of natural gas and raw materials as well as product sales such contracts are generally limited to durations of one year or less cashflow hedge accounting may be elected for these derivative transactions however in some cases when the duration of a derivative is short hedge accounting is not elected when hedge accounting is not elected the changes in fair value of these instruments will be recorded in earnings when hedge accounting is elected gains and losses on these instruments will be deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” to the extent that the hedge remains effective until the underlying transaction is recognized in earnings market risks created by these derivative instruments and the marktomarket valuations of open positions are monitored by management 

 

during 2010 we entered into futures contracts with respect to sales of gasoline and heating oil and purchases of crude oil and sales of gasoline at december 31 2010 futures contracts for 28 million gallons of gasoline and heating oil in the notional amount of 70 million maturing in february 2011 were outstanding 

 

we use value at risk “var” stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes var estimates the maximum potential loss in fair market values given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time using specified confidence levels using sensitivity analysis and hypothetical unfavorable changes in market prices ranging from 27 to 28 from those in effect at december 31 2010 the effect would be to reduce net income by less than 1 million the quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account the effects of the underlying operating transactions 

 

foreign exchange risk 

 

we manufacture and market our products in a number of countries throughout the world and as a result are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates costs in some countries are incurred in part in currencies other than the applicable functional currency 

 

we enter into transactions denominated in other than the functional currency and are therefore exposed to foreign currency risk on receivables and payables we maintain risk management control systems intended to monitor foreign currency risk attributable to both the outstanding foreign currency balances and future commitments the risk management control systems involve the centralization of foreign currency exposure management offsetting exposures and estimating the expected impacts of changes in foreign currency rates on our earnings we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of our net currency exchange exposures for the 2010 successor and predecessor periods and the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 other income loss net in the consolidated statements of income reflected a gain of 18 million losses of 258 million and gains of 123 million and 20 million respectively in net exchange rate gains and 

losses for forward contracts that economically hedge recognized monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies no hedge accounting is applied changes in the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are reported in the consolidated statements of income and offset the currency exchange results recognized on the assets and liabilities 

 

interest rate risk 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to variable rate debt our variable rate debt consists of our 1750 million us assetbased facility and our receivable securitization facility at december 31 2010 there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities

this annual report does not include a report of management’s assessment regarding our internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of the company’s registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the securities and exchange commission for newly public companies 

 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

we maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit with the sec is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the sec an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including the chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation the ceo and cfo have concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports we file with the sec is processed summarized and reported accurately as of the end of the period covered by this annual report this ineffectiveness was caused by the material weakness described below 

 

nevertheless based on a number of factors including the performance of additional procedures by management designed to ensure the correctness of our tax provision and reliability of our financial reporting we believe that the consolidated financial statements in this annual report fairly present in all material respects our financial position results of operations and cash flows as of the dates and for the periods presented in conformity with us gaap 

 

material weakness in internal control over financial reporting 

 

the company has identified a material weakness in its internal controls the company did not maintain adequate controls over the accounting for income taxes related to consideration of the nonrecurring tax effects of fresh start accounting under asc topic 852 “reorganizations” specifically the preparation and presentation of the complex information supporting deferred tax accounting and related disclosures was not sufficient to allow an effective review of that information additionally the analysis of the tax provision information was not sufficient to ensure deferred taxes were accurately accounted for in accordance with us gaap in the appropriate predecessor and successor periods this control deficiency resulted in the misstatement of the deferred tax provision in the successor period for the eight months ended december 31 2010 included in the company’s press release dated february 18 2011 as furnished to the sec under item 202 of form 8k on february 18 2011 the control deficiency also resulted in a revision of deferred tax expense and reorganization items in the predecessor period for the four months ended april 30 2010 and of deferred tax liability and goodwill in the opening balance sheet at may 1 2010 not presented included in the february 18 2011 press release and included in our form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2010 this control deficiency if not corrected could result in a material misstatement of the income tax account that would result in a material misstatement in our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

 

we conducted a detailed review of our tax basis balance sheet accounts at december 31 2010 including a detailed analysis of the tax provision to ensure deferred taxes were accurately accounted for in the appropriate predecessor and successor periods as reported in this annual report 

plan for remediation of material weakness in internal controls 

 

to remediate the material weakness identified we are implementing improvements to our internal controls over the calculation of our income tax provision and related balance sheet accounts specifically we are implementing improved reporting processes to provide clarity of presentation and supporting documentation of the tax provision information including the implementation of standardization and enhanced utilization of tax reporting software to allow timely and effective review and analysis of the tax provision information 

 

we believe these actions will effectively remediate our internal control over financial reporting and enhance our disclosure controls and procedures 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

management together with our ceo and cfo evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2010 we determined that there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2010 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting
