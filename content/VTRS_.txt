licensing and other partner agreements 

we periodically enter into commercial licensing and other partner agreements with other pharmaceutical companies for the development manufacture marketing andor sale of pharmaceutical products doing so helps us share risks and costs leverage strengths and scale up commercialization but usually requires us to also share future profits the result often is that medicines become available sooner and to a significantly larger group of patients 

our significant licensing and other partner agreements are primarily focused on the development manufacturing supply and commercialization of multiple highvalue generic biosimilar compounds insulin analog products and respiratory products among other complex products refer to note 18 licensing and other partner agreements included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for more information 

operations 

viatris has developed an endtoend experience across the total product life cycle which includes global regulatory licensing launch growth and postapproval lifecycle management our research development and medical platform seeks to maximize the impact of our existing portfolio by examining whether there is an opportunity for new indications label extensions formulations and market registrations for our products we also use our platform to determine whether there is an opportunity to integrate new products into our portfolio 

the manufacturing of apis and finished dosage forms is performed by a combination of internal and external manufacturing operations internally many of the products we produce are vertically integrated meaning we manufacture both the apis and finished dosage forms related to those products occasionally however resources we need are available from only a single supplier as a result we supplement our production footprint through arrangements with other manufacturers 

the company’s significant manufacturing warehousing and distribution activities are located primarily in the us puerto rico singapore india japan china and certain eu countries including ireland in addition we maintain administrative facilities around the world while many of these key facilities are owned viatris also leases certain facilities from third parties 

we believe all our facilities are in good operating condition the machinery and equipment are wellmaintained the facilities are suitable for their intended purposes and they have capacities adequate for the current operations 

facilities and records related to our products are subject to periodic inspection by the fda the ema and other regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where our products are marketed in addition authorities often conduct preapproval plant inspections to determine whether our systems and processes comply with current gmp and other regulations and clinicaltrial reviews to evaluate regulatory compliance and data integrity our suppliers contract manufacturers clinical trial partners and other business partners are subject to similar regulations and periodic inspections the company remains committed to maintaining the highest quality manufacturing standards at its facilities around the world and to continuous assessment and improvement in a time of evolving industry dynamics and regulatory expectations 

we are committed to advancing sustainable operations and innovative solutions to improve patient health this means we focus on responsible conduct and have global policies and procedures to support our work we work systematically and diligently to minimize our environmental footprint environmental and human health are interconnected a relationship underscored by climate change and water stress our integrated comprehensive approach focuses on water air emissions waste climate change and energy looking ahead to help ensure we identify and manage risks and opportunities appropriately we are conducting a climate scenario analysis and intend to establish sciencebased greenhouse gas reduction targets and strategies acknowledging the context of the paris agreement as well as goals for water and waste while it is impossible to predict accurately the future costs associated with environmental compliance and potential remediation activities compliance with environmental laws is not expected to require significant capital expenditures and has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our operations or competitive position 

customers and marketing 

our customers include retail and pharmacy establishments wholesalers and distributors payers insurers and governments and institutions such as hospitals among others see “channel types” below for more information about our customers 

the table below displays the percentage of consolidated net sales to our largest customers during the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 



we serve our customers through a team of highlyskilled sales and marketing professionals all of whom are focused on establishing viatris as our customers’ partner of choice to best meet customers’ needs the company manages its business on a geographic basis 

in addition to being dynamic the pharmaceutical industry is complex how it functions how it is regulated and how it provides patients access varies by location similarly competition is affected by many factors examples of factors include innovation and development timely approval of prescription drugs by health authorities manufacturing capabilities product quality marketing effectiveness portfolio size customer service consumer acceptance product price political stability and the availability of funding for healthcare 

certain parts of our business also are affected by seasonality eg due to the timing and severity of peak cough cold and flu incidence which can cause variability in sales trends for some of our products while seasonality may affect quarterly comparisons within a fiscal year it generally is not material to our annual consolidated results 

for these and other reasons the company’s sales and marketing efforts vary accordingly by product market and channel type each of which is described below 

see the application of critical accounting policies section in part ii item 7 of this form 10k for more information related to customer arrangements

viatris markets prescription brand drugs generic drugs complex generic drugs biosimilars and apis 

brand drugs typically are prescription pharmaceuticals that are sufficiently novel as to be protected by patents or other forms of exclusivity as such these drugs which bear trade names may be produced and sold only by those owning the rights subject to certain challenges that other companies may make developing new medicines can take years and significant investment only a few promising therapies ever enter clinical trials fewer still are approved for sale by health authorities at which point marketing to healthcare providers and consumers begins because patents and exclusivities last many years they serve as an incentive to developers during the periods protected developers often recoup their investments and earn a profit in many highincome countries the brand business often is characterized by higher margins on lower volumes  especially as compared with generic manufacturers viatris has numerous branded drugs including iconic brands as well as several global key brands to help patients manage their health brand drugs include branded generics which are offpatent products that are sold under an approved proprietary name for marketing purposes brand products often become branded generics once patent protections or other forms of exclusivity expire branded generic products are common in many countries outside the us including emerging markets brand and branded generic products are more sensitive to promotion than are unbranded generic products they therefore represent the primary focus of most of our sales representatives and productlevel marketing activity our otc products which are sold directly to consumers without a prescription and without reimbursement are generally sold under a brand name 

generic drugs are therapeutically equivalent versions of brand drugs generics generally become available once the patents and other exclusivities on their branded counterparts expire the generics business is generally characterized by lower margins on higher volumes of a relatively large number of products our generic medicines work in the same way and provide the same clinical benefits as their as their brandname counterparts and may cost less providing patients and the healthcare system important savings and medicine options which we believe are essential to making healthcare accessible the manufacturing of generic medicines is held to the same standards of gmp by health authorities as the manufacturing of branded medicines national health authorities inspect our facilities around the world to ensure that generic manufacturing packaging and testing sites pass the same quality standards as those of brand drugs gx products typically are sold under their inns inns facilitate the identification of pharmaceutical substances or apis each inn is unique and globally recognized a nonproprietary name also is known as a generic name 

complex generic drugs are generic medicines that could have a complex active ingredient complex formulation complex route of delivery or complex drug device combinations viatris offers a number of these important medicines to patients including our wixela® inhub® the first generic of advair diskus® and glatiramer acetate injection a generic version of copaxone® for example 

biosimilars are approved by regulatory authorities as highly similar to the originally approved biologic brand version with no clinically meaningful differences in safety or efficacy biosimilar versions are increasingly available as therapeutic alternatives for patients facing many serious diseases including diabetes autoimmune disorders and multiple cancers we offer one of the industry’s largest and most diverse global biosimilars franchises with more than 300 marketing authorizations globally focused on the areas of oncology immunology endocrinology ophthalmology and dermatology these vital products can help increase access for current and future patients while supporting the sustainability of healthcare systems and we continue to invest in bringing more to market as we believe more than twothirds of the products we will launch in the coming years will be either complex generics or biosimilars biosimilars often are marketed under a brandname viatris offers one of the industry’s largest and most diverse global biosimilars franchises including fulphila® ogivri® hulio® and semglee® 

apis are responsible for the therapeutic effects of medicines we are one of the world’s largest producers of apis providing them to customers in more than 100 countries we are the leading producer of api used in generic arvs which treat hivaids we also produce api for products in the following areas antibacterial central nervous system agents antihistaminesantiasthmatics cardiovascular antivirals antidiabetics antifungals and proton pump inhibitors our api is sold through a dedicated sales and marketing team primarily to pharmaceutical companies throughout the world 

viatris invests significant sums in rd and in manufacturing capacity we also often incur substantial litigation expense as a result of defending or challenging brand patents or exclusivities which is described further in note 19 included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

market types 

viatris focuses its sales and marketing efforts on the people who make key decisions around pharmaceutical prescribing dispensing or buying decisionmakers vary by country or region reflecting law and custom giving rise to different types of pharmaceutical markets many countries feature a mix of or hybrids of various market types though the company may focus on just one type in a particular country 

in prescription markets physicians decide which medicines patients will take pharmacies then dispense the products as directed drug companies employ sales forces to educate doctors about the clinical benefits of their products representatives call on individual doctors or group practices the process is known as detailing examples of countries served by viatris that are mainly prescription markets are the us brand business japan china russia turkey poland and mexico 

in substitution markets pharmacists generally are authorized and in some cases required by law to dispense an unbranded or branded generic if available in place of a brandname medicine or vice versa drug companies may use sales forces in these markets too with representatives calling on and educating pharmacy personnel about their organization and products examples of countries served by viatris that are mainly substitution markets are france italy spain portugal and australia 

in tender markets payers such as governments or insurance companies negotiate the lowest price for a drug or group of drugs on behalf of their constituents or members in exchange the chosen supplier’s product is placed on the payer’s formulary or list of covered prescriptions often a supplier’s drug is the only one available in an entire class of drugs large sales forces are not needed to reach these decisionmakers examples of generic markets served by viatris that are mainly tender markets are new zealand sweden south africa as well as germany 

in distribution markets retailers and wholesalers make drugpurchasing decisions large sales forces are not needed to reach the decisionmakers representing these organizations note however that pharmacists operating in distribution markets also may be authorized to make substitution decisions when dispensing medicines examples of countries served by viatris that are mainly distribution markets are the us generics business the uk and norway 

the allocation of our sales and marketing resources reflects the characteristics of these different market types 

in the case of otc products consumers are the decisionmakers otc products are commonly sold via retail channels such as pharmacies drugstores and supermarkets this makes their sale and marketing comparable to other retail businesses with broad advertising and tradechannel promotion consumers often are loyal to wellknown otc brands for this reason suppliers of otc products viatris included must invest the time and resources needed to build strong otc brand names 

channel types 

viatris’ products make their way to patients through a variety of intermediaries or channels 

pharmaceutical wholesalersdistributors purchase prescription medicines and other medical products directly from manufacturers for storage in warehouses and distribution centers the distributors then fill orders placed by healthcare providers and other authorized buyers 

pharmaceutical retailers purchase products directly from manufacturers or wholesalersdistributors they then sell them to consumers in relatively small quantities for personal use 

institutional pharmacies address the unique needs of hospitals nursing homes and other such venues among the services provided are specialized packaging including for injectables and unitdose products for controlled administration 

mailorder and ecommerce pharmacies receive prescriptions by mail fax phone or the internet at a central location process them in large mostly automated centers and mail the drugs to the consumer 

specialty pharmacies focus on managing the handling and service requirements associated with highcost and morecomplex drug therapies such as those used to treat patients with rare or serious diseases

while our us customer base is extensive it increasingly comprises a small number of very large firms as the pharmaceutical industry has undergone and continues to undergo tremendous change and consolidation we believe viatris is well positioned to serve such customers in the developed markets due to the scale we have built in terms of rd api and finisheddosageform manufacturing and portfolio breadth 

greater china 

the greater china segment includes our operations in mainland china taiwan and hong kong since the closing of the combination the viatris greater china portfolio is predominantly branded loe products

government regulation 

regulation by governmental authorities is a significant factor in the rd manufacture marketing sales and distribution of pharmaceuticals our products are subject to robust developmental studies which include analytical determinations of strength quality purity as well as rigorous safety and efficacy determinations using preclinical pharmacokinetic studies and clinical evaluations to gather data to support regulatory review and approval this body of work results in extensive data and scientific information that is incorporated into a given product’s regulatory dossier manufacturing is conducted under exacting conditions governed by extensive regulation including strict inprocess and finished pharmaceutical products specifications and controls postapproval activities such as advertising and promotion pharmacovigilance postmarketing regulatory commitments and pharmacopeial monographs are subject to extensive regulation and controls as well 

the lengthy process of developing products and obtaining required approvals and the continuing need for postapproval compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources regulatory approval if and when obtained may be limited in scope further approved drugs as well as their manufacturers are subject to ongoing postmarketing review and inspection which can lead to the discovery of previously unknown problems with products or the manufacturing or quality control procedures used in their production which may result in restrictions on their manufacture sale or use or in their withdrawal from the market 

any failure or delay by us our suppliers of manufactured drug product collaborators or licensees in obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals could adversely affect the marketing of our products and our ability to receive product revenue license revenue or profitsharing payments 

other regulatory requirements

combination risks 

the integration of the upjohn business with mylan following the combination as well as our global restructuring program may present significant challenges 

the combination of two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process and there is a significant degree of difficulty inherent in the process of integrating the upjohn business and mylan these difficulties include 

• diversion of management’s attention from the ongoing operations of viatris to integration and restructuring matters 

• the challenge of integrating the employees and business cultures of the upjohn business and mylan 

• retaining existing customers and suppliers or obtaining new customers and suppliers 

• risks associated with managing a larger and more complex company 

• the challenge and cost of integrating manufacturing logistics information technology communications and other systems of the upjohn business and mylan 

• the potential difficulty retaining key personnel and other employees of mylan and the upjohn business 

• challenges in reducing reliance on certain transition services provided by pfizer including difficulty hiring employees or finding other suitable replacements and managing the amounts of related replacement costs prior to the expiration of any period in which such services are provided and 

• reducing costs associated with the transition services provided by pfizer 

in addition to integration activities with respect to mylan and the upjohn business viatris is also implementing a significant global restructuring program in order to achieve specified synergies and ensure the new company is optimally structured and efficiently resourced to deliver sustainable value to patients shareholders customers and other stakeholders 

the process of integrating operations and implementing restructuring initiatives could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of one or more of viatris’ businesses these integration and restructuring processes are ongoing and members of viatris’ senior management are required to devote considerable amounts of time to these processes which could decrease the time they have to manage and service viatris’ businesses and develop new products or strategies there is no assurance that viatris will be able to manage this integration or restructuring in the manner or on the timelines currently anticipated if our senior management is not able to timely and effectively manage these integration or restructuring processes significant business activities are interrupted or there is a delay or inability to achieve anticipated integration or restructuring goals viatris may not be able to achieve its synergy targets and there could be a material adverse effect on viatris’ business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

viatris may not realize the anticipated benefits from the combination or its global restructuring program 

viatris is expected to realize synergies growth opportunities and other financial and operating benefits as a result of the combination viatris’ success in realizing these benefits and the timing of their realization depends on the successful integration of the upjohn business with mylan as well as the success of our global restructuring program see “ the integration of the upjohn business with mylan following the combination as well as our global restructuring program may present significant challenges ” above even if the integration and global restructuring program are successful we may not achieve these synergies growth opportunities and other financial and operating benefits within the timeline we anticipate or at all for example the benefits from the combination may be offset by significant costs incurred in connection with our global restructuring program and the combination including integration and postclosing costs costs associated with our tsas with pfizer and capital expenditures which could be higher than currently estimated the quantification of synergies expected to result from the combination is based on significant estimates and assumptions that are subjective in nature and inherently uncertain realization of any benefits and synergies could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control including without limitation general economic conditions increased operating costs regulatory developments and the other risks described in these risk factors in addition our ability to achieve our synergy targets depends in large part on the successful implementation of the initiatives under our global restructuring program which may not achieve their intended goals the amount of synergies actually realized as a result of the combination if any and the time periods in which any such synergies are realized could differ materially from our current expectations and estimates regardless of whether the two business operations are combined successfully in addition if key personnel and other employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration activities viatris’ ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the combination could be reduced if the integration or our global restructuring program are unsuccessful if the estimated costs are higher than anticipated or if we are unable to realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the combination there could be a material adverse effect on viatris’ business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

viatris could incur operational difficulties or losses if pfizer is unable to perform under the agreements entered into as part of the combination if we are unable to obtain the same types and level of services and resources that historically have been provided to the legacy upjohn business by pfizer or if we are required to make payments to pfizer pursuant to indemnities agreed to as part of the combination 

in connection with the combination viatris entered into several agreements with pfizer or its subsidiaries including among others transition services and the manufacturing and supply agreements which in general provide for the performance of certain services or obligations by each of pfizer and viatris for the benefit of each other for a transitional period following the combination if either party is unable to satisfy its obligations under such agreements in a timely manner or at all or if the transitional agreements fail to provide for or cover certain essential services needed by viatris during the applicable transitional period we have limited recourse and could incur operational difficulties or losses or face liability 

in particular the legacy upjohn business historically received benefits and services from pfizer viatris no longer benefits from pfizer’s services or business relationships to the extent not otherwise addressed in the definitive documents entered into in connection with the combination while pfizer has agreed to provide certain transition services to viatris for a transitional period following the combination such services may not provide benefits equivalent to the services provided when the upjohn business was operating as a part of pfizer viatris may not be able to adequately replace resources formerly provided by pfizer or replace such services at the same or lower cost viatris may also need to make significant investments to replicate or outsource from other providers certain facilities systems infrastructure and personnel to which it no longer has access and may incur significant costs to replace such services in addition we may experience operational disruptions associated with ending the transition services that pfizer has agreed to provide viatris under the transition agreements as viatris transitions off of and attempts to replace these services further because viatris is reliant on pfizer for such services during the transitional period any interruption disruption or breach of pfizer’s systems relating to such services including information technology and information security systems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with such transition services viatris and pfizer agreed among other things that each of them will each bear 50 of the first 380 million of certain reasonable outofpocket costs incurred by pfizer in connection with the services with viatris bearing all of such costs in excess of 380 million as of december 31 2021 the company has incurred approximately 835 million of such expenses 

in addition in connection with the combination viatris agreed to indemnify pfizer for certain liabilities any payments pursuant to these indemnities could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends or stock price see “ we are involved in various legal proceedings and certain government inquiries and may experience unfavorable outcomes of such proceedings or inquiries ” below 

viatris may be subject to significant us tax liabilities or be obligated to indemnify pfizer for any such tax liability imposed on pfizer and is subject to potentially significant restrictions that could limit its ability to undertake certain corporate actions such as stock issuances or the undertaking of a merger or consolidation 

in connection with the combination pfizer received the irs ruling and the tax opinion each to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the distribution together with certain related transactions will qualify as a taxfree “reorganization” within the meaning of section 368a1d of the code the distribution will qualify as a taxfree distribution within the meaning of section 355 of the code and the pfizer distribution payments will qualify as money distributed to pfizer creditors or stockholders in connection with the reorganization for purposes of section 361b of the code 

although the irs ruling is generally binding on the irs the continuing validity of the irs ruling is subject to the accuracy of the factual representations made in the ruling request an opinion of tax counsel neither binds the irs nor precludes the irs or the courts from adopting a contrary position accordingly notwithstanding the irs ruling and tax opinion there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert a position contrary to one or more of the conclusions set forth herein and if the irs prevails in such challenge the us federal income tax consequences of the distribution together with certain related transactions to pfizer viatris and the holders of pfizer common stock could be materially different from and worse than the us federal income tax consequences described below 

if the distribution were determined not to have qualified for taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code pfizer would generally be subject to tax as if it sold the viatris common stock in a transaction taxable to pfizer which could result in a material tax liability that under certain circumstances viatris may be required to indemnify pfizer against pursuant to the tax matters agreement 

even if the distribution were otherwise to qualify as a taxfree transaction under sections 368a1d and 355 of the code the distribution would be taxable to pfizer but not to pfizer’s stockholders pursuant to section 355e of the internal revenue code if there were a 50 percent or greater change in ownership of either pfizer or viatris directly or indirectly as part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the distribution for this purpose any acquisitions of pfizer or viatris common stock within the period beginning two years before the distribution and ending two years after the distribution ie on november 16 2022 are presumed to be part of such a plan although pfizer may be able to rebut that presumption for purposes of this test the combination will be treated as part of a plan but the combination standing alone will not cause the distribution to be taxable to pfizer under section 355e of the code because holders immediately before the distribution of pfizer common stock directly owned more than 50 percent of viatris common stock immediately following the combination nevertheless if the irs were to determine that other acquisitions of pfizer common stock or viatris common stock either before or after the distribution were part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the distribution such determination could result in the recognition of a material amount of taxable gain for us federal income tax purposes by pfizer under section 355e of the code under the tax matters agreement viatris will be required to indemnify pfizer against any taxes resulting from the distribution or certain aspects of the separation that arise as a result of viatris’ breach of certain representations or covenants in the tax matters agreement or certain other acts or omissions by viatris including certain actions that could result in section 355e of the code applying to the distribution if viatris was required to indemnify pfizer for taxes resulting from the distribution or certain aspects of the separation that indemnification obligation could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on viatris including with respect to our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the tax matters agreement generally prohibits viatris and its affiliates from taking certain actions that could cause the distribution and certain related transactions to fail to qualify as taxfree transactions to pfizer and its stockholders furthermore unless an exception applies for a twoyear period following the date of the distribution ie until november 16 2022 viatris and its subsidiaries may not 

• engage in transactions in which viatris’ stock is acquired 

• engage in certain mergers or consolidations 

• discontinue the active conduct of the upjohn business 

• sell certain assets 

• redeem or repurchase any of viatris’ stock other than share repurchases permitted by the irs ruling or 

• amend the viatris charter or take any other action affecting the relative voting rights of any of its stock or stock rights 

if viatris intends to take certain restricted actions before november 16 2022 it must notify pfizer of the proposal to take such action and either a obtain a ruling from the irs or an unqualified opinion acceptable to pfizer to the effect that such action will not affect the taxfree status of the distribution and certain related transactions or b receive from pfizer a waiver of such requirement however none of the receipt of an irs ruling an unqualified tax opinion or a waiver by pfizer will relieve viatris of any responsibility to indemnify pfizer for taxrelated losses resulting from such actions as a result of these restrictions and indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement viatris may be limited in its ability to pursue strategic transactions equity or convertible debt financings or other transactions that may otherwise be in our best interests 

strategic risks 

there are risks and uncertainties associated with the pending transaction involving our biosimilars business one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends or stock price  

there are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with the pending biocon biologics transaction including among other things the potential failure of a condition to closing including the conditions related to obtaining required regulatory and other consents and approvals which could give rise to the termination of biocon agreement and related agreements executed between us biocon and biocon biologics as applicable either party has the right to terminate the biocon agreement if the closing has not occurred by march 31 2023 subject to extension in certain circumstances for example a failure by biocon biologics to obtain necessary financing to consummate the transactions contemplated by the biocon agreement prior to such date could cause the biocon agreement to be terminated to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects an assumption that the transactions contemplated by the biocon agreement and related agreements will be consummated in the timeframe and manner currently anticipated and that a portion of the proceeds to us will be used to pay down debt andor to fund other important company initiatives any delay in closing or failure to close could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock similarly any delay in closing or failure to close could result in damage to our relationships with customers suppliers and employees including our existing relationships with biocon and biocon biologics and have an adverse effect on our business pending the completion of the transactions contemplated by the biocon agreement the attention of our management may be directed toward such transactions and related matters and their focus may be diverted from the daytoday business operations of our company including from other opportunities that might otherwise be beneficial to us we have agreed to indemnify biocon biologics and certain of its representatives against certain losses suffered as a result of certain breaches of our representations warranties covenants and agreements in the biocon agreement and related documents any event that results in a right for biocon biologics to seek indemnity from us could result in substantial liability to us and could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations in addition in connection with the closing of the pending transaction with biocon biologics we will enter into a transition services agreement pursuant to which we will provide services to biocon biologics including commercialization services substantially the same as we currently provide to our biosimilar business generally for a period of up to two years once in effect our obligations under the transition services agreement may result in additional expenses that are borne by us and may divert our focus and resources that would otherwise be invested into maintaining or growing our retained business furthermore a significant portion of the consideration that we will receive in the pending transaction with biocon will be in the form of equity in biocon biologics which is a privately held indian company although we have negotiated certain “downside” protection regarding the value of that equity in the biocon agreement and related documents such protection does not guarantee any particular liquidity event or our ability to monetize our equity and even if we are able to successfully liquidate our equity the downside protection may be inadequate to guarantee a minimum return that we or investors expect in addition we believe the success of the biocon biologics business over at least the first two years after closing will be highly dependent upon the successful transition of the business to biocon including no major disruption in services provided under the transition services agreement which will also have a significant impact on the value of the equity we will own in biocon biologics 

whether the biocon biologics transaction is ultimately consummated or not the pendency could have a number of negative effects on our current business including potentially disrupting our regular operations diverting the attention of our workforce and management team and increasing workforce turnover it could also disrupt existing business relationships make it harder to develop new business relationships or otherwise negatively impact the way that we operate the business which could negatively impact viatris’ results of operations and cash flows during the pendency of the transaction 

if we successfully complete the pending transaction involving our biosimilars business our total revenues results of operations and cash flows from operating activities are expected to be negatively impacted in the periods after close we have expended significant time and resources and expect to continue to expend significant time and resources on the transaction involving our biosimilars business including management time and focus costs and expenses related to the separation of the biosimilars business from viatris the provision of the transition services and other transaction costs many of these expenses must be paid regardless of whether the transaction closes and even if the expected benefits are not achieved we may also face other challenges as a result of the announcement and completion of the transactions contemplated by the biocon agreement including that we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits from such transactions such as deploying the proceeds to pay down our outstanding indebtedness andor fund other important initiatives and maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees to provide the transition services and to operate our retained business 

any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

our strategic initiatives including our strategic alliances may not achieve all intended benefits 

in addition to the integration and restructuring activities and the biocon biologics transaction each of which is discussed above we have entered into and continue to consider and evaluate various strategic transactions and business arrangements on an ongoing basis including acquisitions asset purchases partnerships collaborations joint ventures divestitures product rationalization and investments these transactions and arrangements may be material both from a strategic and financial perspective we may miscalculate the risks associated with our strategic initiatives including business development transactions at the time they are made or not have the resources or ability to access all the relevant information to evaluate them properly including with regard to the potential of rd pipelines manufacturing issues compliance issues or the outcome of ongoing legal and other proceedings there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully realize the expected benefits of any such transactions or arrangements furthermore divestitures product rationalizations or asset sales could result in decreased total revenues results of operations and cash flows from operating activities in future periods reduce the size or scope of our business our market share in particular markets or our opportunities and ability to compete with respect to certain markets therapeutic areas or products in addition should we seek to divest other of our assets and business we may be unable to dispose of such businesses and assets on satisfactory or commercially reasonable terms or within our anticipated timeline in part because of competition from other companies in pursuing similar transactions in the pharmaceutical industry 

we have also entered into strategic alliances with partners including through our global healthcare gateway® to develop manufacture market andor distribute certain products andor certain components of our products in various markets we commit substantial effort funds and other resources to these various collaborations including with respect to the development of biosimilar products there is a risk that the investments made by us in these collaborative arrangements will not generate financial returns while we believe our relationships with our partners generally are successful disputes or conflicting priorities and regulatory or legal intervention could be a source of delay or uncertainty as to the expected benefits of the collaboration in addition we enter into agreements with our collaboration partners that provide for certain services as well as cross manufacturing development and licensing arrangements in addition our global healthcare gateway® may not achieve all of its expected benefits 

the overall execution of a strategic initiative may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses operational inefficiencies adverse tax consequences loss of customer relationships difficulty attracting and retaining qualified employees and diversion of management’s andor employee’s attention among other potential adverse consequences in addition we may have to terminate a strategic alliance or our collaboration partners may be unable to fulfill their collaboration obligations 

any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we have and may continue to experience pressure on the pricing of and reimbursements for certain of our products due to pricing controls social or government pressure to lower the cost of drugs and consolidation across the supply chain 

we operate in a challenging environment with significant pressures on the pricing of our products and on our ability to obtain and maintain satisfactory rates of reimbursement for our products by governments insurers and other payors the growth of overall healthcare costs has led governments and payors to implement new measures to control healthcare spending as a result we face numerous costcontainment measures by governments and other payors including certain governmentimposed industrywide price reductions mandatory rebates or pricing international reference pricing ie the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries volumebased procurement tender systems shifting of the payment burden to patients through higher copayments and requirements for increased transparency on pricing all of which may have an adverse impact on the pricing of our products 

many markets in which we operate have implemented or may implement tender systems for generic and biosimilar pharmaceuticals in an effort to lower prices under such tender systems manufacturers submit bids which establish prices for generic pharmaceutical products upon winning the tender the winning company will receive a preferential reimbursement for a period of time if our bids do not win we may not be able to participate in the given market or may lose out on market share in addition if customers to whom we supply api do not win their tender bids the amount of api that we sell to them may be reduced while criteria other than price can be included in tenders tender systems often select the lowest bid which often results in companies underbidding one another by proposing low pricing in order to win the tender other markets may also consider the implementation of a tender system and even if a tender system or other price controls are ultimately not implemented the anticipation of such could result in price reductions 

in the eu uk and some other international markets the government provides healthcare at low cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility andor reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system these systems of price regulations may lead to inconsistent and lower prices within the eu and in other countries the availability of our products in some markets at lower prices undermines our sales in other markets with higher prices additionally certain countries set prices by reference to the prices in other countries where our products are marketed thus our inability to secure adequate prices in a particular country may also impair our ability to obtain acceptable prices in existing and potential new markets and may create the opportunity for third party crossborder trade in addition to the impacts of these governmentsponsored healthcare systems in the eu uk and other international markets certain governmental agencies have or are considering enacting further measures to decrease the costs of providing healthcare including government mandated price reductions andor other forms of price controls including retrospective “clawback” price reductions as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the changing healthcare landscape in those markets 

in china pricing pressures have increased in recent years and the chinese government has also increased its focus on patient access and reimbursement for pharmaceutical medicines for example in 2013 china began to implement a qce process for postloe products to improve the quality of domestically manufactured generic drugs primarily by requiring such drugs to pass a test to assess their bioequivalence to a qualified reference drug typically the originator drug in addition vbp policy for post loe products is now in its fourth year and includes more than 200 molecules in addition the bidding process has resulted in significant price cuts for the molecules included with some bidders reducing the price of their products by as much as 96 as they attempt to secure volumes on the chinese pharmaceutical market we expect pricing pressures on our products included in the vbp program to continue to increase as a result of these programs we have failed and may continue to fail to win bids due to various factors including uncompetitive bidding prices in addition the urp policy will cap reimbursement of molecules at their vbp tender winning price urp will create additional pricing and volume pressure for pharmaceutical products that are subject to the program and is expected to negatively impact our results of operations 

demand for our products also depends in part on the extent to which reimbursements are available in the us thirdparty payors increasingly challenge the pricing of pharmaceutical products these trends and other trends toward managed healthcare the vertical consolidation among insurers pbms and pharmacies and legislative healthcare reform create significant uncertainties regarding the future levels of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products further any reimbursement may be reduced in the future to the point that market demand for our products andor our profitability declines changes to medicare andor state medicaid programs or changes required in the way in which medicare payment rates are set the design of the medicare part d benefit andor the way medicaid rebates are calculated could adversely affect the payment we receive for our products in order to control expenditures on pharmaceuticals most member states in the eu regulate the pricing of products and in some cases limit the range of different forms of pharmaceuticals available for prescription by national health services these controls can result in considerable price differences between member states 

there has also been increasing us federal and state legislative and enforcement interest with respect to drug pricing as well as from international organizations like the united nations who and organization for economic cooperation and development in addition to intense publicity and scrutiny regarding such matters including publicity and pressure resulting from prices charged by competitors and peer companies for new products as well as price increases by competitors and peer companies on older products that some have deemed excessive 

in addition there have been executive orders legislation and legislative and regulatory proposals including in connection with government programs such as medicare concerning drug prices and related issues including the perceived need to bring more transparency to drug pricing reviewing the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reforming government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs although we expect to see continued focus in regulating pricing we cannot predict what if any additional legislative or regulatory developments may transpire at the state or country level or what the ultimate impact may be 

in the us certain of these pressures are further compounded by increasing consolidation among wholesalers retailer drug chains pbms private insurers managed care organizations and other private payors which can increase their negotiating power particularly with respect to our generic drugs please also refer to “ a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales to a limited number of customers” 

the numerous costcontainment measures by governments and other payors failing to win tenders the implementation of price control systems adverse legislation and regulation the consolidation of our customers or continued social or government pressure to lower the cost of pharmaceutical products could have a material adverse impact on our business reputation financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

healthcare reform legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in recent years there have been numerous initiatives on the federal and state levels for comprehensive reforms affecting the payment for the availability of and reimbursement for healthcare services in the us and it is likely that congress and state legislatures and health agencies will continue to focus on healthcare reform in the future while the aca increased the number of patients who have insurance coverage for our products it also included provisions such as the assessment of a pharmaceutical manufacturer fee and an increase in the amount of rebates that manufacturers pay for coverage of their drugs by medicaid programs the aca may be subject to revisions and modifications in the future further congress continues to consider drug pricing legislation that if passed and signed into law could impact companies’ ability to increase prices for products beyond the rate of inflation and could allow medicare to negotiate prices on a subset of brand drugs 

we are unable to predict the future course of federal or state healthcare legislation or reform including temporary or permanent healthcare reform measures resulting from the covid19 pandemic or the outcome of challenges to such laws or reforms once passed the aca and further changes in the law or regulatory framework that reduce our revenues or increase our costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price additionally we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries 

significant additional reforms to the us healthcare system or to the healthcare systems of other markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we have significant operations globally which exposes us to the risks inherent in conducting our business internationally 

our operations extend to numerous countries globally and therefore are subject to the risks inherent in this geographic scope these risks include but are not limited to 

• the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

• compliance with the national and local laws regulations and customs of countries in which we do business including but not limited to data privacy and protection environmental and social regulations importexport and enforcement of intellectual property protections

• increased trade controls or sanctions as a result of the escalation of tensions between russia and ukraine that may affect our ability to market or sell pharmaceuticals in either country 

• changes in laws regulations and practices affecting the pharmaceutical industry and the healthcare system including but not limited to imports exports manufacturing quality cost pricing reimbursement approval inspection and delivery of healthcare 

• changes in policies designed to promote foreign investment including significant tax incentives liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation 

• increased eu and us scrutiny of overseas pharmaceutical manufacturing including executive orders and policy proposals related to increasing domestic production of pharmaceutical products and api 

• differing local product preferences and product requirements 

• adverse changes in the economies in which we or our partners and suppliers operate as a result of a slowdown in overall growth a change in government or economic policies or financial political or social change or instability in such countries that affects the markets in which we operate particularly emerging markets

• changes resulting from the formal withdrawal of the uk from the eu commonly referred to as brexit including those related to additional trade agreements tariffs and customs regulations and currency fluctuations which could materially impact the way we conduct our operations in those markets 

• supply disruptions and increases in energy and transportation costs 

• increased tariffs on the import or export of our products or api including on imports from china to the us as a result of the escalation of trade tensions between the countries or otherwise 

• burdens to comply with multiple changing and potentially conflicting laws regulations and disclosure requirements including those relating to environmental social and governance matters carbon emissions health and safety labor and human rights 

• natural or manmade disasters including droughts floods earthquakes hurricanes and the impact of climate change in the countries in which we or our partners and suppliers operate and 

• local disturbances the outbreak of highly contagious diseases or other health epidemics such as covid19 terrorist attacks riots social disruption wars or regional hostilities in the countries in which we or our partners and suppliers operate and that could affect the economy our operations and employees by disrupting operations and communications making travel and the conduct of our business more difficult andor causing our customers to be concerned about our ability to meet their needs 

we also face the risk that some of our competitors have more experience with operations in such countries or with international operations generally and may be able to manage unexpected crises more easily moreover the internal political stability of or the relationship between any country or countries where we conduct business operations may deteriorate changes in a country’s political stability or the state of relations between any such countries are difficult to predict and the political or social stability in andor diplomatic relations between any countries in which we or our partners and suppliers do business could meaningfully deteriorate 

the occurrence of any one or more of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

charges to earnings resulting from acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price  

under us gaap provisions relating to business acquisition accounting standards we recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in acquired companies generally at their acquisition date fair values and in each case separately from goodwill goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess amount of consideration transferred which is also generally measured at fair value and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain after we complete an acquisition the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results and may adversely affect our cash flows 

• costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention redeployment or relocation expenses 

• liabilities assumed in purchase accounting 

• impairment of goodwill or intangible assets including acquired iprd 

• amortization of intangible assets acquired 

• a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired 

• identification of or changes to assumed contingent liabilities including but not limited to litigation reserves contingent purchase price consideration including fair value adjustments income tax contingencies and other nonincome tax contingencies after our final determination of the amounts for these contingencies or the conclusion of the measurement period generally up to one year from the acquisition date whichever comes first 

• charges to our operating results to eliminate certain duplicative preacquisition activities including exiting tsas with pfizer 

• significant costs to restructure our operations and to reduce our cost structure including cost related to severance payments plant shutdowns and costs to achieve anticipated synergies and 

• charges to our operating results resulting from expenses incurred to effect the acquisition 

a significant portion of these adjustments could be accounted for as expenses that will decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those costs are incurred 

in particular the amount of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in our consolidated balance sheets is significant as a result of our acquisitions and other transactions and may increase further following future potential acquisitions and we may from time to time sell assets that we determine are not critical to our strategy or execution future events or decisions may also lead to asset impairments andor related charges certain noncash impairments may result from a change in our strategic goals business direction or other factors relating to the overall business environment any such charges could cause a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we applied purchase accounting to the combination and determined that mylan was the accounting acquirer in the combination for purposes of applying purchase accounting to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of the upjohn business in connection with the combination 

the illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit or ipinfringing versions of our products or of diverted or stolen products could have a negative impact on our reputation and our business 

the pharmaceutical drug supply has been increasingly challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit or ipinfringing products in a growing number of markets and widespread over the internet 

third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit or ipinfringing versions of our products that do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective and can be potentially lifethreatening counterfeit medicines may contain harmful substances the wrong api an incorrect dose of api or no api at all depriving patients of the therapeutic benefit of such medicines however to distributors and users counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version 

reports of adverse reactions to counterfeit or ipinfringing drugs or increased levels of counterfeiting could materially affect patient confidence in the authentic product it is possible that adverse events caused by unsafe counterfeit products will mistakenly be attributed to the authentic product in addition unauthorized diversions of products or thefts of inventory at warehouses plants or while intransit could result in improper storage or compromise product integrity and therefore adversely impact patient safety our reputation and our business 

loss of sales or revenues as well as public loss of confidence in the integrity of pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting diversion or theft could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we face vigorous competition that threatens the commercial acceptance and pricing of our products  

the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive we face competition from other pharmaceutical manufacturers globally some of whom are significantly larger than we are and have stronger more wellestablished reputations than us our competitors may be able to develop products and processes competitive with or superior to our own for many reasons including but not limited to the possibility that they may have 

• proprietary processes or delivery systems 

• larger or more productive rd and marketing staff 

• larger or more efficient production capabilities in a particular therapeutic area 

• more experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials 

• more products 

• more experience in developing new drugs or 

• greater financial resources 

we also face increasing competition from lowercost generic products and other branded products including our arv products certain of our products are not protected by patent rights or have limited patent life and will soon lose patent protection loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly with the launch of generic products as a result sales of many of these products may decline or stop growing over time and may decline faster than has been projected for example perforomist® lost exclusivity and experienced generic competition in june 2021 and the compound patent for celebrex in japan expired in november 2019 with generics entering the market in june 2020 in june 2019 lyrica’s pediatric exclusivity in the united states expired and multisource generic competition commenced in the united states in july 2019 additionally over the next several years some products may lose market exclusivity upon entry of generic products prior to patent exclusivity for example several companies launched a generic to lyrica in japan in december 2020 despite pending patent infringement litigation the litigation remains ongoing we have received several unfavorable rulings and the patents expire in july 2022 we may not be successful in managing competition from nonbranded generics or other alternatives or in generally managing revenues after loss of exclusivity and our business may be materially adversely affected 

generic competitors are also becoming more aggressive in terms of pricing in many of the regions in which viatris operates in china for example we face strong competition from certain generic manufacturers which may result in price cuts and volume loss on some of viatris’ branded products in many emerging markets we face increased competition and contracting markets for certain of our arv products primarily related to competing therapies we also face competition in the united states the eu and other mature markets that have a robust generics market and favorable regulatory conditions for generics in addition legislative proposals emerge from time to time in various jurisdictions to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs any such proposal that is enacted into law could increase competition and worsen this negative effect on our branded sales 

in addition certain of our products also face potential competition from products that may be developed in the future that could render our products uncompetitive or obsolete for example companies may develop medicines that treat the same indications targeted by our products and these medicines could be more effective than our products or patients and physicians could prefer these medicines over our medicines the introduction of these new competing products could also have a negative impact on product sales 

other related factors that could affect our business include 

• competitors’ products may also be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower prices or better performance features than ours 

• pbms and other pharmaceutical manufacturers may utilize contracting strategies that could decrease utilization of or otherwise negatively impact our products 

• vertical integration of pharmacies and large purchasing organizations or consolidation among distribution outlets and 

• our sales may suffer as a result of changes in consumer demand for our products including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality or covid19 willingness of customers to switch among products of different pharmaceutical manufacturers importation by consumers or the introduction of new products by competitors 

the occurrence of any of the above risks could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

a relatively small group of products may represent a significant portion of our revenues net sales gross profit or net earnings from time to time 

sales of a limited number of our products from time to time represent a significant portion of our revenues net sales gross profit and net earnings for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 viatris’ top ten products in terms of sales in the aggregate represented approximately 33 and 23 respectively of the company’s net sales the increase in the concentration of our top product sales in 2021 was primarily driven by the impact of the combination if the volume or pricing of our largest selling products declines in the future our business financial condition results of operations cash flows andor share price could be materially adversely affected 

operational risks 

public health outbreaks epidemics and pandemics including the covid19 pandemic have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows andor stock price and may impact our ability to pay dividends 

public health outbreaks epidemics and pandemics including the covid19 pandemic have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business we continue to closely monitor the impact of the covid19 pandemic on all aspects of our business including its impact on our workforce suppliers vendors business partners distribution channels customers and patients as the pandemic continues to evolve and new covid19 variants are detected the rate of infection remains high in many countries including the us attempts continue to be made to reduce the spread of covid19 including quarantines vaccination programs including boosters increased testing government restrictions on movement business closures and suspensions canceled events and activities selfisolation and other voluntary andor mandated changes in behavior both the outbreak and continued spread of covid19 and actions to slow its spread have created and continue to create significant uncertainty economic volatility and disruption supply chain disruption and increased unemployment which have impacted and may continue to impact our business operations and workforce in addition recovery from the pandemic may not proceed as anticipated and may have unpredictable impacts on demand for our products our workforce and our business operations all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our workforce business operations financial condition results of operations cash flows andor stock price and may impact our ability to pay dividends 

while our business operations are currently considered essential based on current government guidelines throughout the world due to the important role pharmaceutical manufacturers play within the global healthcare system many of our administrative offices have been operating under work from home protocols in addition certain programs or incentives implemented to ensure employee health and safety such as subsidized testing hazard pay sick leave and bonus payments have increased our operating costs extended changes in work conditions including work from home protocols could strain our business continuity plans reduce productivity and morale or introduce operational risk including but not limited to increased cybersecurity risk for example remote working environments may be less secure and some may seek to exploit the covid19 pandemic to initiate hacking attacks phishing and social engineering attempts and malware attacks 

additionally we have taken extra precautions at our manufacturing facilities to aid in the protection of onsite personnel and operations including the implementation of social distancing guidelines daily health assessments of onsite personnel providing vaccinations on site and split shifts where feasible if we experience an increase in reported illnesses or quarantining at any of our facilities including critical manufacturing sites it is possible that such facilities may need to close for an extended period of time which could negatively affect our ability to produce ship and supply products to our customers and would impact our business and financial results 

in addition some of our customerfacing field personnel continue to operate on a remote engagement model to ensure continued support for healthcare professionals patient care and access to needed products a remote engagement model may not be as successful as inperson meetings and could result in lower sales of products particularly new products we have also taken steps to protect the safety of study participants employees and staff at clinical trial sites while continuing to ensure regulatory compliance and scientific integrity of trial data 

covid19 and related responsive measures have also made and may continue to make it difficult for us our partners or suppliers to source and manufacture products in and to export our products from certain affected areas in addition we have faced and may continue to face delays or difficulty sourcing certain products or raw materials including apis even if we are able to find alternate sources for such products or raw materials they may cost more in addition we have experienced and may continue to experience increased shipping and freight costs as well as delays in shipping these factors have materially adversely affected and could continue to materially adversely affect our ability to produce ship and supply products which could negatively impact our customer relationships business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price or result in negative publicity and reputational harm 

lower retail pharmacy demand as well as some patients doctors and hospitals delaying or foregoing routine doctor and hospital visits and elective medical procedures has led and could continue to lead to decreased demand for certain of our products which has negatively impacted our sales results of operations and financial results at the same time we have experienced and could continue to experience unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products which could exceed our capacity to meet such demand and negatively impact our customer relationships business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

health regulatory agencies globally may also experience disruptions in their operations and greater regulatory uncertainty as a result of the covid19 pandemic for instance the fda has announced its intention to temporarily postpone certain inspections of domestic and foreign manufacturing facilities the fda and comparable foreign regulatory agencies may have slower response times or reduced resources and as a result review of regulatory submissions inspections approval of 

new products and other timelines important to our business may be materially impacted which could delay our new product launches and have a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition our continued access to external sources of liquidity depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings also the continuing impact of the covid19 pandemic could lead to our customers or suppliers having liquidity problems that could negatively impact our ability to collect cash on our receivables andor negatively impact our ability to get inventory and materials if the impacts of the pandemic create further disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets or customer or supplier liquidity issues or if rating agencies lower our credit ratings it could adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial position 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will continue to impact us depends on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not currently able to predict and may also exacerbate other risks discussed in these risk factors any of which could have a material adverse effect on us our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

current and changing economic conditions may adversely affect our industry business partners and suppliers 

the global economy continues to experience significant volatility and the economic environment may become less favorable economic volatility governmental financial restructuring efforts and evolving deficit and spending reduction programs could negatively impact the global economy and the pharmaceutical industry this has led or could lead to reduced consumer and customer spending reduced or eliminated governmental or thirdparty payor coverage or reimbursement or reduced spending on healthcare including but not limited to pharmaceutical products while generic drugs present an alternative to higherpriced branded products our sales could be negatively impacted if patients forego obtaining healthcare patients and customers reduce spending or purchases or if governments or thirdparty payors reduce or eliminate coverage or reimbursement amounts for pharmaceuticals or impose price or other controls adversely impacting the price or availability of pharmaceuticals whether for generics branded products or both in addition reduced consumer and customer spending reduced government or thirdparty payor coverage or reimbursement or new government controls may drive us and our competitors to decrease prices may reduce the ability of customers to pay or may result in reduced demand for our products 

in addition accelerating rates of inflation are expected to continue in the near future and have resulted and may continue to result in increased costs of labor raw materials other supplies and freight and distribution costs among others for the pharmaceutical industry and the healthcare systems in the markets in which we participate the pricing dynamics of our products generally does not provide the opportunity to pass on such costs to customers inflation may also result in higher interest rates and increased costs of capital 

the occurrence of any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our industry business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

failure to comply with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations worldwide could adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we are subject globally to various laws and regulations concerning among other things the environment climate change water waste chemicals and employee safety these requirements include regulation of the handling manufacture transportation storage use and disposal of materials and wastes including the discharge of regulated materials and emissions into the environment we are also subject to related permitting recordkeeping reporting and registration requirements in the normal course of our business we are exposed to risks relating to possible releases of hazardous substances into the environment which could cause environmental or property damage or personal injuries and which could result in i our noncompliance with such environmental and occupational health and safety laws regulations and permits and ii regulatory enforcement actions or claims for personal injury and property damage against us if environmental discharge occurs or if we discover contamination caused by third parties including by prior owners and operators of properties we acquire or lease or by neighboring properties or other offsite sources we could be liable for cleanup or remediation obligations damages and fines or have relevant permits authorizations or registrations modified or revoked regardless of our responsibility for such contamination in addition any noncompliance with environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations and permits or emissions into the environment whether actual or perceived may result in significant reputational damage the substantial unexpected costs we may incur could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations are also complex and subject to change and our related capital expenditures and costs for compliance may increase substantially in the future as a result of such changes the development and manufacturing of a new product or increased development or manufacturing activities at any of our facilities we may be required to expend significant funds and our 

manufacturing activities could be delayed or suspended or we may lose the ability to purchase or use certain materials or face restrictions on the amounts of materials we may use or purchase which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

the pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated and we face significant costs and uncertainties associated with our efforts to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

the pharmaceutical industry is subject to regulation by various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate including the us eu china and india for instance we must comply with applicable laws and requirements of the fda and other regulatory agencies including foreign authorities with respect to the research development manufacture quality safety effectiveness approval labeling tracking tracing authentication storage recordkeeping reporting pharmacovigilance sale distribution import export marketing advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products we are committed to conducting our business including the sale and marketing of our products in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations these laws and regulations however are numerous complex and continue to evolve and it is possible that a governmental authority may challenge our activities or that an employee or agent could violate these laws and regulations without our knowledge failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in a range of consequences including but not limited to fines penalties disgorgement exclusion from us federal healthcare reimbursement programs unanticipated compliance expenditures suspension of review of applications or other submissions rejection or delay in approval of applications recall or seizure of products total or partial suspension of production andor distribution our inability to sell products the return by customers of our products injunctions andor criminal prosecution under certain circumstances a regulator may also have the authority to revoke or vary previously granted drug approvals 

the safety profile of any product will continue to be closely monitored by the fda and comparable foreign regulatory authorities after approval if such regulatory authorities become aware of new safety information about any of our marketed or investigational products those authorities may require further inspections enhancements to manufacturing controls labeling changes establishment of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or similar strategy restrictions on a product’s indicated uses or marketing or postapproval studies or postmarket surveillance in addition we are subject to regulations in various jurisdictions including the federal drug supply chain security act in the us the falsified medicines directive in the eu and several other such regulations in other countries that require us to develop electronic systems to serialize track trace and authenticate units of our products through the supply chain and distribution system compliance with these regulations has in the past and may in the future result in increased expenses for us or impose greater administrative burdens on our organization and failure to meet these requirements could result in fines or other penalties 

in recent years the regulatory framework in china regarding the pharmaceutical industry has undergone significant changes and chinese authorities have become increasingly vigilant in enforcing laws in the pharmaceutical industry we believe that viatris’ strategies regarding pharmaceutical research development manufacturing and commercialization in china are currently aligned with the chinese government’s policies but they may in the future diverge requiring a change in such strategies any such change may result in increased compliance costs to us or cause delays in or prevent the successful research development manufacturing or commercialization of our products in china result in the loss of required licenses and permits or the suspension or termination of viatris’ activities in china 

the fda and comparable foreign regulatory authorities also regulate the facilities and operational procedures that we use to manufacture our products we must register our facilities with the fda and similar regulators in other countries products must be manufactured in our facilities in accordance with cgmp or similar standards in each territory in which we manufacture compliance with such regulations and with our own quality standards requires substantial expenditures of time money and effort in multiple areas including training of personnel recordkeeping production and quality control and quality assurance the fda and other comparable regulatory authorities including foreign authorities periodically inspect our manufacturing facilities for compliance with cgmp or similar standards in the applicable territory regulatory approval to manufacture a drug is granted on a sitespecific basis failure to comply with cgmp and other regulatory standards at one of our or our partners’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facilities could result in an adverse action brought by the fda or other regulatory authorities which could result in the receipt of an untitled or warning letter fines penalties disgorgement unanticipated compliance expenditures rejection or delay in approval of applications suspension of review of applications or other submissions suspension of ongoing clinical trials recall or seizure of products total or partial suspension of production andor distribution our inability to sell products the return by customers of our products orders to suspend vary or withdraw marketing authorizations injunctions consent decrees requirements to modify promotional materials or issue corrective information to healthcare practitioners refusal to permit import or export criminal prosecution andor other adverse actions 

our business could be adversely affected if any regulatory body were to delay withhold or withdraw approval of an application require a recall or other adverse product action require one of our manufacturing facilities to cease or limit production or suspend vary or withdraw related marketing authorization delay and cost in obtaining fda or other regulatory approval to manufacture at a different facility also could have a material adverse effect on our business 

although we have established internal quality and regulatory compliance programs and policies there is no guarantee that these programs and policies as currently designed will meet regulatory agency standards in the future or will prevent instances of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations additionally despite our compliance efforts from time to time we or our partners receive notices of manufacturing and qualityrelated observations following inspections by regulatory authorities around the world as well as official agency correspondence regarding compliance for example the fda has issued warning letters relating to valsartan api and nitrosamine impurities to our api manufacturers mylan laboratories limited unit 8 and mylan laboratories limited unit 7 we have provided thorough responses to the fda regarding the issues identified and remediation is ongoing we and our partners have in the past and may in the future receive similar observations and correspondence if we are unable to resolve these observations and address regulatory concerns in a timely fashion our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price could be materially adversely affected 

we utilize controlled substances in certain of our current products and products in development and therefore must meet the requirements of the controlled substances act of 1970 and the related regulations administered by the dea in the us as well as those of similar laws in other countries where we operate these laws relate to the manufacture shipment storage sale and use of controlled substances the dea and other regulatory agencies limit the availability of the controlled substances used in certain of our current products and products in development and as a result our procurement quota of these active ingredients may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials we must annually apply to the dea and similar regulatory agencies for procurement quotas in order to obtain these substances any delay or refusal by the dea or such similar agencies in establishing our procurement quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches or could cause trade inventory disruptions for those products that have already been launched in addition some states have passed laws and regulations imposing assessments on the sale or distribution of certain controlled substances and other states are considering and may implement similar laws and regulations in the future 

the occurrence of any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

the use of legal regulatory and legislative strategies by both brand and generic competitors including but not limited to “authorized generics” and regulatory petitions may increase costs associated with the introduction or marketing of our generic products could delay or prevent such introduction and could significantly reduce our revenue and profit  

our competitors both branded and generic often pursue strategies that could prevent or delay generic alternatives to branded products these strategies include but are not limited to 

• entering into agreements whereby other generic companies will begin to market an authorized generic which is the approved brandname drug without the brandname on its label at the same time or after generic competition initially enters the market 

• launching their own authorized generic product prior to or at the same time or after generic competition initially enters the market 

• pricing a branded product at a discount equivalent to generic pricing 

• filing frivolous petitions with the fda or other regulatory bodies seeking to prevent or delay approvals including timing the frivolous filings so as to thwart generic competition by causing delays of our product approvals 

• contracting strategies among pharmaceutical manufacturers and pbms that could decrease generic or biosimilar utilization and negatively impact our product launches 

• seeking to establish regulatory and legal obstacles that would make it more difficult to demonstrate bioequivalence or to meet other requirements for approval andor to prevent regulatory agency review of applications 

• initiating legislative or other efforts to limit the substitution of generic versions of brand pharmaceuticals 

• filing suits for patent infringement and other claims that may delay or prevent regulatory approval manufacture andor sale of generic products 

• introducing “nextgeneration” products prior to the expiration of market exclusivity for the reference product which often materially reduces the demand for the generic or the reference product for which we seek regulatory approval 

• persuading regulatory bodies to withdraw the approval of brandname drugs for which the patents are about to expire and converting the market to another product of the brand company on which longer patent protection exists 

• obtaining extensions of market exclusivity by conducting clinical trials of brand drugs in pediatric populations or by other methods and 

• seeking to obtain new patents on drugs for which patent protection is about to expire 

in the us some companies have lobbied congress for amendments to hatchwaxman act that would give them additional advantages over generic competitors for example although the term of a company’s drug patent can be extended to reflect a portion of the time an nda which is filed in the us with the fda when approval is sought to market a newly developed branded product and in certain instances for a new dosage form a new delivery system or a new indication for a previously approved drug is under regulatory review some companies have proposed extending the patent term by a full year for each year spent in clinical trials rather than the onehalf year that is currently permitted 

if proposals like these in the us eu or in other countries where we or our partners and suppliers operate were to become effective or if any other actions by our competitors and other third parties to prevent or delay activities necessary to the approval manufacture or distribution of our products are successful our entry into the market and our ability to generate revenues associated with new products may be delayed reduced or eliminated which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

if we are unable to successfully introduce new products in a timely manner our future revenue and profitability may be adversely affected 

our future revenues and profitability will depend in part upon our ability to successfully and timely develop license or otherwise acquire and commercialize new products product development is inherently risky especially for new drugs for which safety and efficacy have not been established andor the market is not yet fully developed as well as for complex generic drugs and biosimilars likewise product licensing involves inherent risks including among others uncertainties due to matters that may affect the achievement of milestones as well as the possibility of contractual disagreements with regard to whether the supply of product meets certain specifications or terms such as license scope or termination rights as viatris focuses more on complex products the development and commercialization process requires substantial time effort and financial resources we or a partner may not be successful in commercializing such products on a timely basis or at all which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

before any prescription drug product including generic drug products can be marketed marketing authorization approval is required by the relevant regulatory authorities andor national regulatory agencies for example the fda in the us the ema in the eu and other regulatory authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approval to manufacture and market new branded and generic pharmaceutical products is rigorous time consuming costly and inherently unpredictable in addition these regulatory agencies may be delayed in reviewing and approving products as a result of lapsed or insufficient funding insufficient staffing travel or work restrictions including as a result of the covid19 pandemic or other factors beyond our control any delay in regulatory approval could impact the commercial or financial success of a product 

outside the us the approval process may be more or less rigorous depending on the country and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required in the us bioequivalence clinical or other studies conducted in one country may not be accepted in other countries the requirements for approval may differ among countries and the approval of a pharmaceutical product in one country does not necessarily mean that the product will be approved in another country we or a partner or supplier may be unable to obtain requisite approvals on a timely basis or at all for new products that we may develop license or otherwise acquire moreover if we obtain regulatory approval for a drug it may be limited for example with respect to the indicated uses and delivery methods for which the drug may be marketed or may include warnings precautions or contraindications in the labeling which could restrict our potential market for the drug a regulatory approval may also include postapproval study or risk management requirements that may substantially increase the resources required to market the drug also for products pending approval we may obtain raw materials or produce batches of inventory to be used in efficacy and bioequivalence testing as well as in anticipation of the product’s launch in the event that regulatory approval is denied or delayed we could be exposed to the risk of this inventory becoming obsolete 

the approval process for generic pharmaceutical products often results in the relevant regulatory agency granting final approval to a number of generic pharmaceutical products at the time a patent claim for a corresponding branded product or other market exclusivity expires this often forces us to face immediate competition when we introduce a generic product into the market additionally further generic approvals often continue to be granted for a given product subsequent to the initial launch of the generic product these circumstances generally result in significantly lower prices as well as reduced margins for generic products compared to branded products new generic market entrants generally cause continued price margin and sales erosion over the generic product life cycle 

in the us the hatchwaxman act provides for a period of 180 days of generic marketing exclusivity for a “first applicant” that is the first submitted anda which is filed in the us with the fda when approval is sought to market a generic equivalent of a drug product previously approved under an nda and listed in the fda publication entitled approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations popularly known as the “orange book” or for a new dosage strength for a drug previously approved under an anda containing a certification of invalidity noninfringement or unenforceability related to a patent listed with the anda’s reference drug product commonly referred to as a paragraph iv certification during this exclusivity period which under certain circumstances may be shared with other andas filed on the same day the fda cannot grant final approval to latersubmitted andas for the same generic equivalent if an anda is awarded 180day exclusivity the applicant generally enjoys higher market share net revenues and gross margin for that generic product however our ability to obtain 180 days of generic marketing exclusivity may be dependent upon our ability to obtain fda approval or tentative approval within an applicable time period of the fda’s acceptance of our anda if we are unable to obtain approval or tentative approval within that time period we may risk forfeiture of such marketing exclusivity by contrast if we are not a “first applicant” to challenge a listed patent for such a product we may lose significant advantages to a competitor with 180day exclusivity even if we obtain fda approval for our generic drug product the same would be true in situations where we are required to share our exclusivity period with other anda sponsors with paragraph iv certifications 

in the eu and other countries and regions there is no exclusivity period for the first generic product the commission or national regulatory agencies may grant marketing authorizations to any number of generics 

if we are unable to navigate our products through the approval process in a timely manner there could be an adverse effect on our product introduction plans business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we expend a significant amount of resources on rd efforts that may not lead to successful product introductions 

much of our development effort is focused on technically difficulttoformulate products andor products that require advanced manufacturing technology including our biosimilars program and respiratory platform we conduct rd primarily to enable us to gain approval for manufacture and market pharmaceuticals in accordance with applicable laws and regulations we also partner with third parties to develop products typically research expenses related to the development of innovative or complex compounds and the filing of marketing authorization applications for innovative and complex compounds such as ndas and biosimilar applications in the us are significantly greater than those expenses associated with the development of and filing of marketing authorization applications for most generic products such as andas in the us and abridged applications in europe as we and our partners continue to develop new andor complex products our research expenses will likely increase because of the inherent risk associated with rd efforts in our industry including the high cost and uncertainty of conducting clinical trials where required particularly with respect to new andor complex drugs our or a partner’s rd expenditures may not result in the successful introduction of new pharmaceutical products approved by the relevant regulatory bodies also after we submit a marketing authorization application for a new compound or generic product the relevant regulatory authority may change standards andor request that we conduct additional studies or evaluations and as a result we may incur approval delays as well as rd costs in excess of what we anticipated 

clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete and its outcome is inherently uncertain failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process we or our partners may experience delays in our ongoing or future clinical trials and we do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin or enroll subjects on time need to be redesigned or be completed on schedule if at all 

clinical trials may be delayed suspended or prematurely terminated for a variety of reasons if we experience delays in the completion of or the termination of any clinical trial of our product candidates the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed in addition any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues any of these occurrences may harm our business financial condition and prospects significantly in addition many of the factors that cause or lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates 

finally we cannot be certain that any investment made in developing products will be recovered even if we are successful in commercialization to the extent that we expend significant resources on rd efforts and are not able ultimately to introduce successful new andor complex products as a result of those efforts there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

even if our products in development receive regulatory approval such products may not achieve expected levels of market acceptance  

even if we are able to obtain regulatory approvals for our new products the success of those products is dependent upon market acceptance levels of market acceptance for our products could be impacted by several factors including but not limited to 

• the availability perceived advantages and relative safety and efficacy of alternative products from our competitors 

• the degree to which the approved labeling supports promotional initiatives for commercial success 

• the prices of our products relative to those of our competitors 

• the timing of our market entry 

• the effectiveness of our marketing sales and distribution strategy and operations and 

• other competitor actions including legal actions 

additionally studies of the proper utilization safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products are being conducted by the industry government agencies and others such studies which increasingly employ sophisticated methods and techniques can call into question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed as well as future products in some cases such studies have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuation or variation of product marketing authorizations or requirements for risk management programs such as a patient registry any of these events could adversely affect our profitability business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

the development approval process manufacture and commercialization of biosimilar products involve unique challenges and uncertainties and our failure to successfully introduce biosimilar products could have a negative impact on our business and future operating results 

we and our partners and suppliers are actively working to develop and commercialize biosimilar products although the bpcia established a framework for the review and approval of biosimilar products and the fda has begun to review and approve biosimilar product applications there continues to be significant uncertainty regarding the regulatory pathway in the us with the fda continuing to issue and revise guidance related to its interpretation and implementation of the bpcia there is also uncertainty regarding the pathway to obtain approval for biosimilar products in other countries as well as uncertainty regarding the commercial pathway to successfully market and sell such products 

moreover biosimilar products generally involve extensive patent clearances and often involve patent infringement litigation related to multiple patents which could delay or prevent the commercial launch of a biosimilar product for many years if we are unable to obtain fda or other nonus regulatory authority approval for our products we will be unable to market them in addition the development and manufacture of biosimilars pose unique challenges related to the supply of the materials needed to manufacture biosimilars access to and the supply of necessary biological materials may be limited and government regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials 

even if our biosimilar products are approved for marketing the products may not be commercially successful may require more time than expected to achieve market acceptance and may not generate profits in amounts that are sufficient to offset the amount invested to obtain such approvals market success of biosimilar products will depend on demonstrating to regulators patients physicians and payors such as insurance companies that such products are safe and effective yet offer a more competitive price or other benefit over existing therapies in addition manufacturers of biologic products may try to dissuade physicians from prescribing or accepting biosimilar products we may not be able to generate future sales of biosimilar products in certain jurisdictions and may not realize the anticipated benefits of our investments in the development manufacture and sale of such products if our development efforts do not result in the development and timely approval of biosimilar products or if such products once developed and approved are not commercially successful or upon the occurrence of any of the above risks our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price could be materially adversely affected 

our business is highly dependent upon market perceptions of us our products and brands and the safety and quality of our products and brands as well as the effectiveness of our sales and marketing activities and we may be adversely impacted by negative publicity or findings 

market perceptions of us are very important to our business especially market perceptions of our company products brands and the safety and quality of our products and brands if we our partners and suppliers or our products or brands suffer from negative publicity are subject to market withdrawal or recall or are proven to be or are claimed to be ineffective or harmful to consumers then this could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business in addition viatris believes that maintaining and enhancing certain of its brands is important and often provides certain competitive advantages 

viatris’ sales and marketing efforts are anchored by promoting its products to physicians pharmacists clinics and hospitals therefore viatris’ sales and marketing force whether inhouse sales representatives or thirdparty commercial partners must possess a relatively high level of technical knowledge uptodate understanding of industry trends and expertise in the relevant therapeutic areas and products as well as promotion and communication skills marketing advertising and promotions may be expensive and may not achieve their intended benefits if viatris is unable to effectively train its inhouse sales representatives and thirdparty commercial partners or monitor and evaluate their marketing performances our sales and marketing may be less successful than desired in addition fewer inperson sales and marketing efforts as a result of restrictions put in place in order to contain the covid19 pandemic or other similar limitations may result in less successful sales and marketing activities 

given our dependence on market perception and sales and marketing efforts negative publicity associated with product or brand quality patient illness or other adverse effects resulting from or perceived to be resulting from our products or brands or our partners’ and suppliers’ manufacturing facilities or an inability to increase or maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of our sales and marketing activities could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales to a limited number of customers 

a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales to a limited number of customers if we were to experience a significant reduction in or loss of business with one or more such customers or if one or more such customers were to experience difficulty in paying us on a timely basis our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price could be materially adversely affected 

in addition a significant amount of our sales are to a relatively small number of drug wholesalers and retail drug chains these customers represent an essential part of the distribution chain of generic pharmaceutical products drug wholesalers and retail drug chains have undergone and are continuing to undergo significant consolidation this consolidation has resulted in these groups gaining additional purchasing leverage and consequently increasing the product pricing pressures facing our business we expect this trend of increased pricing pressures to continue additionally the emergence of large buying groups representing independent retail pharmacies and the prevalence and influence of managed care organizations and similar institutions increases the negotiating power of these groups enabling them to attempt to extract price discounts rebates and other restrictive pricing terms on our products these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we have a limited number of manufacturing facilities and certain thirdparty suppliers produce a substantial portion of our api and products some of which require a highly exacting and complex manufacturing process 

a substantial portion of our capacity as well as our current production is attributable to a limited number of manufacturing facilities and certain thirdparty suppliers a significant disruption at any one of such facilities within our internal or thirdparty supply chain even on a shortterm basis whether due to the failure of a thirdparty supplier to fulfill the terms of their agreement with us labor disruption adverse quality or compliance observation other regulatory action infringement of brand or other thirdparty intellectual property rights natural disaster civil or political unrest export or import restrictions or other events could impair our ability to produce and ship products to the market on a timely basis and could among other consequences subject us to exposure to claims from customers any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price the adverse effects of any of these events could be exacerbated as a result of our previously announced global restructuring program which includes the closing downsizing or divesting of a number of facilities globally if we or our thirdparty suppliers’ face significant manufacturing issues this could lead to shutdowns delays or product shortages or to our being entirely unable to supply certain products to customers for an extended period of time in addition our facilities may be required to close for periods of time be required to staff at reduced capacity or suffer other manufacturing delays as the result of an outbreak of disease epidemic or pandemic such as the covid19 pandemic in or near any of our facilities such shortages delays or shutdowns have led and could continue to lead to significant losses of sales revenue thirdparty litigation or negative publicity see also “ the pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated and we face significant costs and uncertainties associated with our efforts to comply with applicable laws and regulations” 

we purchase certain api and other materials and supplies that we use in our manufacturing operations as well as certain finished products from many different foreign and domestic suppliers the price of api and other materials and supplies is subject to volatility including as a result of global supply chain disruptions due to covid19 or other events in certain cases we have listed only one supplier in our applications with regulatory agencies there is no guarantee that we will always have timely sufficient or affordable access to critical raw materials or finished product supplied by third parties even when we have more than one supplier which could lead to our or our partners’ and suppliers’ inability to supply sufficient quantities of our products to meet market demand in addition quality deficiencies in the products which we or our suppliers provide or at our or their manufacturing facilities have in the past and could in the future adversely impact our manufacturing and supply capabilities cause supply interruptions or lead to voluntary market withdrawals or product recalls for example the eu has implemented particularly stringent regulations with respect to manufacturing standards for api imported into europe that place the certification requirement on the regulatory bodies of the exporting countries an increase in the price or an interruption in the supply of a singlesourced or any other raw material including the relevant api or in the supply of finished product could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

in connection with the combination viatris entered into certain manufacturing and supply agreements with pfizer reliance on pfizer under those agreements entails risks related to regulatory and quality assurance including cgmp compliance unforeseen disruption of the manufacture or supply or our products the possible breach of the agreement by pfizer the possible misappropriation of our proprietary information or the possible termination of the agreements at a time that is costly or inconvenient to viatris any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price see also “ viatris could incur operational difficulties or losses if we are unable to obtain the same types and level of services and resources that historically had been provided to the legacy upjohn business by pfizer if pfizer is unable to perform under the agreements entered into as part of the combination or if we are required to make payments to pfizer pursuant to indemnities agreed to as part of the combination  

in addition the manufacture of some of our products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing at our or our thirdparty suppliers’ facilities for a variety of reasons including among others equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials natural disasters power outages labor disputes or other civil unrest cybersecurity or compliance issues and environmental health and safety issues laws regulations and permits if problems arise during the production of a batch of product that batch of product may have to be discarded this could among other things lead to increased costs contractual penalties lost revenue damage to customer relations time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred 

if we or one of our suppliers experience any of the problems described above such problems could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

our future success is highly dependent on our ability to attract motivate and retain key personnel 

given the size complexity and global reach of our business it is important that we attract motivate and retain qualified management and other key employees in order to develop and commercialize new products manage our business and compete effectively our ability to do so also depends in part on how well we maintain a strong diverse and inclusive workplace culture that is attractive to employees competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical industry is intense current or prospective viatris employees may have changing expectations around workplace flexibility and a failure to meet these evolving expectations may result in reduced ability to attract and retain talent in addition current or prospective viatris employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles at the company as a result of the continued integration process with respect to the combination the end of certain tsa arrangements our global restructuring program or other strategic initiatives as a result we may lose key personnel or may be unable to attract retain and motivate qualified individuals or the associated costs may increase if we fail to attract develop incentivize and retain key scientific technical commercial regulatory information securityprivacy or management personnel this could lead to loss of customers business disruption and a decline in revenues adversely affect the progress of pipeline products or otherwise adversely affect our operations additionally while we work to ensure that we have effective plans in place for management succession throughout the organization any anticipated or unanticipated management transition could create uncertainty which could disrupt or result in changes to our strategy and have a negative impact on our business if we are unsuccessful in retaining our key employees or enforcing certain postemployment contractual provisions such as confidentiality or noncompetition provisions it may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

compliance risks 

we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act chinese anticorruption laws and similar worldwide anticorruption laws which impose restrictions on certain conduct and may carry substantial fines and penalties 

we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act chinese anticorruption laws and similar anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions these laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and some have record keeping requirements the failure to comply with these laws could result in substantial criminal andor monetary penalties we operate in jurisdictions that have experienced corruption bribery payoffs and other similar practices from timetotime and in certain circumstances such practices may be local custom we have implemented and trained relevant employees and third party agents regarding internal control policies and procedures that mandate compliance with these anticorruption laws however we cannot be certain that these policies and procedures will protect us against liability there can be no assurance that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible if our employees or agents are found to have engaged in such practices we could suffer severe criminal or civil penalties reputational harm and other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

our competitors including branded pharmaceutical companies andor other third parties may allege that we or our suppliers are infringing upon their intellectual property including in an “at risk launch” situation which could result in substantial monetary damages impact our ability to launch a product andor our ability to continue marketing a product andor force us to expend substantial resources in resulting litigation the outcome of which is uncertain 

companies that produce branded pharmaceutical products and other patent holders routinely bring litigation against entities selling or seeking regulatory approval to manufacture and market generic forms of their branded products as well as other entities involved in the manufacture supply and other aspects relating to api and finished pharmaceutical products these companies and other patent holders may allege patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights as the basis for filing suit against an applicant for a generic product as well as others who may be involved in some aspect of research supply production distribution testing packaging or other processes litigation often involves significant expense and can delay or prevent introduction or sale of our generic products if patents are held valid and infringed by our products in a particular jurisdiction we andor our suppliers or partners may unless we or the suppliers or partners could obtain a license from the patent holder need to cease manufacturing and other activities including but not limited to selling in that jurisdiction we may also need to pay damages surrender or withdraw the product or destroy existing stock in that jurisdiction 

there also may be situations such as the decision to launch our insulin glargine and dimethyl fumarate products where we use our business judgment and decide to market and sell products directly or through third parties notwithstanding the fact that allegations of patent infringements and other thirdparty rights have not been finally resolved by the courts ie an “atrisk launch” the risk involved in doing so can be substantial because the remedies available to the owner of a patent for infringement may include among other things a reasonable royalty on sales damages measured by the profits lost by the patent holder or by profits earned by the infringer if there is a finding by a court of willful infringement the definition of which is subjective such damages may be increased by up to three times moreover because of the discount pricing typically involved with bioequivalent products patented branded products generally realize a substantially higher profit margin than generic or biosimilar products an adverse decision in a case such as this or a judicial order preventing us or our suppliers and partners from manufacturing marketing selling andor other activities necessary to the manufacture and distribution of our products could result in substantial penalties andor have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we rely on the effectiveness of our patents trademarks confidentiality agreements and other measures to protect our intellectual property rights 

our ability to commercialize any branded product successfully will largely depend upon our or any partner’s or supplier’s ability to obtain maintain and enforce patents and trademarks of sufficient scope to lawfully prevent third parties from developing andor marketing infringing products in the absence of adequate intellectual property protections or other barriers to entry competitors may adversely affect our branded products business by independently developing andor marketing substantially equivalent products it is also possible that we could incur substantial costs if we initiate litigation against others to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 

we may submit patent filings covering the api formulation methods of making andor methods of using for our branded products and branded product candidates we may not be issued patents based on patent applications already filed or that we file in the future further due to other factors that affect patentability and if patents are issued they may be insufficient in scope to protect our branded products from generic competition as generics may be able to design around our patents patents are national in scope and therefore the issuance of a patent in one country does not ensure the issuance of a patent in any other country furthermore the patent position of companies in the pharmaceutical industry generally involves complex legal and factual questions and has been and remains the subject of significant litigation legal standards relating to scope and validity of patent claims are evolving and may differ in various countries any patents we have obtained or obtain in the future may be challenged invalidated or circumvented moreover the us patent and trademark office or any other governmental agency may commence or institute postgrant review inter partes review interference proceedings or other challenges to our patents or patent applications although many of our products do not have patent protection we continue to take steps to defend our patents for certain of our products for example many companies launched a generic to lyrica in japan in december 2020 despite pending patent litigation and the fact that these patents expire in july 2022 the patent litigation remains ongoing and we have received several unfavorable rulings 

in addition branded products often have market viability based upon the goodwill of the product name which typically is the subject of a trademark registration or filing our branded products may therefore also be subject to risks related to the loss of a trademark or patent or to competition from generic or other branded products challenges can come from other businesses individuals or governments and governments could require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property any challenge to or invalidation or circumvention of our intellectual property including patents or patent applications copyrights and trademark protection would be costly would require significant time and attention of our management and could cause a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we also rely on trade secrets unpatented proprietary knowhow trade dress regulatory exclusivity and continuing technological innovation that we seek to protect in part by confidentiality agreements with licensees suppliers employees and consultants these measures may not provide adequate protection for our unpatented technology if these agreements are breached it is possible that we will not have adequate remedies disputes may arise concerning the ownership of intellectual property or the applicability of confidentiality agreements furthermore our trade secrets and proprietary technology may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors or we may not be able to maintain the confidentiality of information relating to such products 

our ability to enforce intellectual property rights also depends on the laws of individual countries each country’s practices with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights and the extent to which certain countries may seek to engage in policies or practices that may weaken its intellectual property framework eg a policy of routine compulsory licensing or threat of compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical intellectual property if we are unable to adequately protect our technology trade secrets or proprietary knowhow or enforce our intellectual property rights this could cause a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

our reporting and payment obligations related to our participation in us federal healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and the va are complex and often involve subjective decisions that could change as a result of new business circumstances new regulations or agency guidance or advice of legal counsel any failure to comply with those obligations could subject us to investigation penalties and sanctions 

us federal laws regarding reporting and payment obligations with respect to a pharmaceutical company’s participation in federal healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and the va are complex because our processes for calculating applicable government prices and the judgments involved in making these calculations involve subjective decisions and complex methodologies these calculations are subject to risk of errors and differing interpretations in addition they are subject to review and challenge by the applicable governmental agencies and it is possible that such reviews could result in changes that may have material adverse legal regulatory or economic consequences 

any governmental agencies or authorities that have commenced or may commence an investigation of us relating to the sales marketing pricing quality or manufacturing of pharmaceutical products could seek to impose based on a claim of violation of antifraud and false claims laws or otherwise civil andor criminal sanctions including fines penalties and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs including medicare medicaid andor the va some of the applicable laws may impose liability even in the absence of specific intent to defraud furthermore should there be ambiguity with regard to how to properly calculate and report payments—and even in the absence of any such ambiguity—a governmental authority may take a position contrary to a position we have taken and may impose or pursue civil andor criminal sanctions governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations requirements or conditions of participation some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid there can be no assurance that our submissions will not be found by cms or the va to be incomplete or incorrect any failure to comply with the above laws and regulations and any such penalties or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and certain government inquiries and may experience unfavorable outcomes of such proceedings or inquiries 

we are or may be involved in various legal proceedings and certain government inquiries or investigations including but not limited to patent infringement product liability personal injury securities fraud claims with respect to the manufacture sale marketing and distribution of opioid products antitrust matters breach of contract and claims involving medicare medicaid andor va reimbursements or laws relating to sales marketing and pricing practices these proceedings may involve claims for or the possibility of fines and penalties involving substantial amounts of money or other relief including but not limited to civil or criminal fines and penalties and exclusion from participation in various government healthcarerelated programs 

viatris is subject to investigations and extensive regulation by government agencies in the united states china and other developed markets and emerging markets in which we operate criminal charges substantial fines andor civil penalties limitations on viatris’ ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions as well as reputational harm and increased public interest in the matter could result from government investigations with respect to government enforcement of state and federal laws including antitrust laws as well as private plaintiff litigation of socalled “pay for delay” patent settlements large verdicts settlements or government fines are possible especially in the us and eu additionally some state legislatures have and the us federal government or additional state legislatures could enact legislation to limit patent settlements between pharmaceutical companies and deem such patent agreements as anticompetitive these changes could impact our ability to launch generic products prior to the originator’s patent expiry 

in connection with the combination the company has generally assumed liability for and control of pending and threatened legal matters relating to the upjohn business and has agreed to indemnify pfizer for liabilities arising out of such assumed legal matters pfizer however has agreed to retain various matters – including certain specified competition law matters – to the extent they arise from conduct during the predistribution period and has agreed to indemnify the company for liabilities arising out of such matters if pfizer were to dispute its retention of these matters or if there is an adverse outcome in the matters that pfizer has agreed to retain this could have an adverse impact on viatris in addition viatris has agreed to pay pfizer an amount equal to 57 of any losses actually incurred or suffered by viatris its predecessors or subsidiaries since july 29 2019 arising out of thirdparty actions relating to the manufacture distribution marketing promotion or sale of opioids by or on behalf of viatris its predecessors or subsidiaries if any of these legal proceedings or inquiries were to result in an adverse outcome the impact could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

emerging developments in the us legal landscape relative to the liability of generic pharmaceutical manufacturers for certain product liabilities claims could increase our exposure to litigation costs and damages including in connection with third party defense and indemnification demands although we maintain a combination of selfinsurance and commercial insurance no reasonable amount of insurance can fully protect against all risks because of the potential liability inherent in the business of producing pharmaceuticals for human consumption to the extent that a loss occurs depending on the nature of the loss and the level of insurance coverage maintained it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

in addition in limited circumstances entities that we have acquired are party to litigation in matters under which we are or may be entitled to indemnification by the previous owners even in the case of indemnification there are risks inherent in such indemnities and accordingly there can be no assurance that we will receive the full benefits of such indemnification or that we will not experience an adverse result in a matter that is not indemnified which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price

if we fail to comply with our corporate integrity agreement we could be subject to substantial penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs 

in august 2017 mylan inc and mylan specialty lp then subsidiaries of mylan and now subsidiaries of viatris entered into the cia with the oighhs the cia has a fiveyear term and requires among other things enhancements to our compliance program fulfillment of reporting and monitoring obligations management certifications and resolutions from mylan inc’s board as well as that an independent review organization annually review various matters relating to the medicaid drug rebate program among other things if we fail to comply with the cia the oighhs may impose substantial monetary penalties or exclude us from federal healthcare programs including medicare medicaid or the va which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we are increasingly dependent on it and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks including cybersecurity and data leakage risks 

significant disruptions to our it systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated it systems and infrastructure to operate our business the number of new vulnerabilities identified to these systems combined with the increased number of systems that reach end of life each year creates an opportunity for successful malicious attacks such attacks are increasingly sophisticated and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise including state and quasistate actors criminal groups “hackers” and others any security breach or other disruption to our or our vendors’ it infrastructure could also interfere with or disrupt our business operations including our manufacturing distribution rd sales andor marketing activities 

we outsource significant elements of our operations to third parties including as part of our tsas with pfizer some of these third parties are outside the us including significant elements of our it infrastructure and as a result we are managing many independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information the overall increase in supply chain attacks on companies generally such as solarwinds kronos and accellion and our interdependency on third party suppliers increases the potential for supply disruptions and service it outages in addition to our reliance upon third parties to provide it and information security services the market for such services continues to contract and converge increasing both the challenges in identifying competent providers and the impact of a breach incident with any single vendor in the ordinary course of business we and our vendors collect store and transmit large amounts of confidential information including trade secrets or other intellectual property proprietary business information and personal information and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information the size and complexity of our and our vendors’ systems and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them also makes them potentially vulnerable to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees partners or vendors or from attacks by malicious third parties maintaining the security confidentiality and integrity of this confidential information including trade secrets or other intellectual property proprietary business information and personal information is important to our competitive business position however such information can be difficult to protect while we have taken steps to identify and protect such information and to ensure that the thirdparty vendors’ on which we rely have taken adequate steps to protect such information there can be no assurance that our or our vendors’ efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches in our systems or the unauthorized or inadvertent wrongful use or disclosure of confidential or material nonpublic information that could adversely affect our business operations or result in the loss misappropriation andor unauthorized access use or disclosure of or the prevention of access to confidential information 

a breach of our or our vendors’ security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure unapproved dissemination misappropriation or misuse of trade secrets proprietary information or other confidential information whether as a result of theft hacking fraud trickery or other forms of deception or for any other cause could enable others to produce competing products use our proprietary technology or information andor adversely affect our business position further any such interruption security breach or loss misappropriation andor unauthorized access use or disclosure of confidential information including personal information regarding our patients and employees could result in financial legal business and reputational harm to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial legal business or reputational losses that may result from a breakdown breach cyberattack or other compromise of or interruption to our it systems or confidential and other sensitive information we also cannot ensure that any limitation of liability or indemnity provisions in our contracts including with vendors and service providers for a security lapse or breach or other security incident would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim 

we are subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations in many different jurisdictions and countries where we do business and our or our vendors’ inability to comply could result in fines penalties or reputational damage and could impact the way we operate our business 

we are subject to federal state and international data privacy and security laws and regulations governing the collection use disclosure transmission and protection of personal information including healthrelated information as the legislative and regulatory landscape for data privacy and security continues to evolve around the world there has been an increasing focus on data privacy and security matters that may affect our business 

in the us federal laws include hipaa which governs the use disclosure and security of protected health information by hipaa covered entities and business associates several us states including california virginia colorado pennsylvania and florida have enacted or proposed broad data privacy laws and regulations governing the confidentiality security use and disclosure of personal information which may impose greater restrictions than federal data privacy and security laws and regulations and provide transparency and privacy rights for their citizens we may also be subject to other state data privacy and security breach notification laws state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws such as the federal controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing canspam act which impose requirements for the collection use disclosure transmission and protection of personal information each of these laws are subject to varying interpretations by courts and regulatory or government agencies creating complex compliance issues for us if we or the thirdparty vendors on which we rely fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to fines penalties or sanctions including criminal penalties 

outside of the us the eu’s and uk’s gdpr and local implementing regulations impose significant compliance obligations on our organization the gdpr contains data protection requirements in the eu and uk and imposes a framework of obligations and restrictions governing the collection processing and the transmission of personal information to jurisdictions outside of the eu and uk the gdpr affords individuals with a series of privacy rights related to the collection processing and transmission of their personal information the gdpr imposes significant compliance obligations including required processes and policies governing our collection transmission processing and use of individuals personal information in addition the gdpr includes significant penalties for noncompliance with fines up to the higher of €20 million or 4 of total annual worldwide revenue in general gdpr and other data protection laws and regulations could require adaptation of our technologies or practices to satisfy local country data protection requirements and standards 

other countries in which we operate such as australia brazil canada india japan south korea russia and south africa have or are developing laws and regulations governing the collection use securing and transmission of personal information as well that may affect our business or require us to adapt our technologies or practices recently china enhanced its cybersecurity law and data security law framework by enacting a significant and omnibus data privacy law the personal information protection law pipl which became effective in november 2021 the pipl is china’s first comprehensive data protection law which aims to protect the rights and interests of individuals by introducing stringent requirements for companies doing business in china regarding the protection control and use of personal information 

these and similar initiatives could increase the cost of developing implementing or maintaining our it systems require us to allocate more resources to compliance initiatives or increase our costs in addition a failure by us or our thirdparty vendors to comply with applicable data privacy and security laws may lead to government enforcement actions and private litigation which could result in financial legal business and reputational harm to us and could have a material adverse effect on the way we operate our business our financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers regulators investors employees and other stakeholders with respect to our environmental social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks 

companies are facing increasing expectations and scrutiny from customers regulators investors employees and other stakeholders related to their environmental social and governance practices and disclosure investor advocacy groups investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices especially as they relate to the environment climate change health and safety supply chain management diversity labor conditions and human rights both in our own operations and in our supply chain failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our reputation ability to do business with certain partners access to investors and capital and our stock price 

in addition a growing number of our customers including certain government purchasers have adopted or may adopt procurement policies that include social and environmental requirements including for example requirements to monitor and conduct third party audits or these customers may seek to include such provisions in their procurement contract terms and conditions these social and environmental responsibility provisions and initiatives are subject to change vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and certain elements may be difficult andor cost prohibitive for us to comply with given the inherent complexity of our external supply chain and the global scope of our operations in certain circumstances in order to meet the requirements or standards of our customers we may be obligated to modify our sourcing practices or make other operational choices which may require additional investments and increase our costs or result in inefficiencies alternatively we may be ineligible to participate in bids or tenders in certain markets which may result in lost sales and revenues 

any of the factors mentioned above or the perception that we or our suppliers or contract manufacturers have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for such issues regardless of whether we are legally required to do so may damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business employees relations access to investors and capital financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

our business and operations are subject to risks related to climate change 

the effects of global climate change present risks to our business extreme weather natural disasters power outages or other conditions caused by climate change could adversely impact our supply chain and the availability and cost of raw materials water supply and other components required for the operation of our business or result in the delay andor disruption of our ability to deliver products such conditions could also result in physical damage to our or our partners’ products plants and distribution centers as well as the infrastructure and facilities of hospitals medical care facilities and other customers our programs to plan for and mitigate risk and build resilience to the impacts of climate change may not be successful current or future insurance arrangements may not provide protection for costs that may arise from such events particularly if such events are catastrophic in nature or occur in combination in addition regulations intended to limit greenhouse gas emissions or water usage such as carbon pricing taxes on emissions fuel and energy or to mitigate the impacts of climate change may become more prevalent which could increase our operating costs and the costs charged by suppliers these events could have a material adverse effect on the way we operate our business our financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price

although viatris currently intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends to its stockholders there is no assurance that viatris will declare and pay or have the ability to declare and pay any dividends on its common stock in the future whether dividends will be paid and the amount and frequency of any such dividend payments will depend upon a number of factors including viatris’ results of operations cash flows financial position competitive or commercial developments contractual or statutory restrictions and any other factors considered relevant by the viatris board such payments and the amount and frequency thereof are also subject to the other risks set forth in these risk factors in addition although the board of directors has authorized a stock buyback program there is no guarantee that we will implement repurchases under the program or if we do the timing or amount of any future share repurchases under such program even if implemented we will not be obligated to repurchase shares under any such stock buyback program and until november 2022 such a program may be impacted by certain conditions in our tax matters agreement other factors including changes in tax or securities laws could also impact our stock buybacks a stock buyback program could affect our stock price and increase volatility and any announcement of a pause in or termination of a share buyback program may result in a decrease in our stock price payment of a cash dividend or share repurchases will reduce the amount of cash available to the company for other activities including repayment of debt investment in the business or other capital expenditures 

if the intercompany terms of cross border arrangements that we have among our subsidiaries are determined to be inappropriate or ineffective our tax liability may increase 

we have potential tax exposures resulting from the varying application of statutes regulations and interpretations which include exposures on intercompany terms of crossborder arrangements among our subsidiaries including intercompany loans sales and services agreements in relation to various aspects of our business including manufacturing marketing sales and delivery functions although we believe our crossborder arrangements among our subsidiaries are based upon internationally accepted standards and applicable law tax authorities in various jurisdictions may disagree with and subsequently challenge the amount of profits taxed in their country which may result in increased tax liability including accrued interest and penalties which would cause our tax expense to increase and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we may not be able to maintain competitive financial flexibility and our corporate tax rate which could adversely affect us and our shareholders 

we believe that our structure and operations give us the ability to achieve competitive financial flexibility and a competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate we must make material assumptions underlying our expected tax rates including regarding the effect of certain internal reorganization transactions including various intercompany transactions we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be however because of among other reasons uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate potential changes of laws and interpretations thereof and the potential for tax audits or challenges our actual effective tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material furthermore the tax laws of other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate 

any of the factors discussed above could materially increase our overall effective income tax rate and income tax expense and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities and changes in income tax laws and tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate and income tax expense 

we are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions significant analysis and judgment are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are currently subject to tax audits and investigations in several jurisdictions and may be subject to other audits and investigations in the future the final determination of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our income tax provisions and accruals 

additionally changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in our overall profitability changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws or in their application the results of audits and the examination of previously filed tax returns and related challenges and assessments by taxing authorities and continuing assessments of our tax exposures could impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

currency fluctuations and changes in exchange rates could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

although we report our financial results in us dollars a significant portion of our revenues indebtedness and other liabilities and our costs are denominated in nonus currencies including among others the chinese renminbi euro swedish krona indian rupee korean won japanese yen australian dollar canadian dollar british pound sterling south african rand and brazilian real our results of operations and in some cases cash flows have in the past been and may in the future be adversely affected by certain movements in currency exchange rates defaults or restructurings in other countries could have a similar adverse impact in addition there remains significant international pressure on the chinese government to adopt a more flexible currency policy including from the us government which designated china as a “currency manipulator” in august 2019 and subsequently removed such designation in january 2020 which could result in greater fluctuation of the renminbi against the us dollar from time to time we may implement currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates however our hedging strategies may not be successful and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue to be subject to market fluctuations 

in addition viatris also faces risks arising from currency devaluations and the imposition of cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by its foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls for example in china the conversion of currency in the “capital account” eg capital items such as direct investments or loans requires the approval of the state administration for foreign exchange in china or its local branches which could materially and adversely affect the ability of our chinese operating subsidiaries and affiliated companies to obtain foreign currencies through equity financing or for capital expenditures therefore impeding our overall business operations while we currently have no need and do not intend to repatriate or convert cash held in countries that have significant restrictions or controls in place should we need to do so to fund our operations we may be unable to repatriate or convert such cash or be unable to do so without incurring substantial costs 

the occurrence of any of the above risks could cause a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we have significant indebtedness which could lead to adverse consequences or adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness and any refinancing of this debt could be at significantly higher interest rates  

our level of indebtedness could have important consequences including but not limited to 

• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and investments dividend payments and other general corporate purposes 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to challenges and opportunities and changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and debt service requirements and other financing needs 

• increasing our vulnerability to increases in interest rates in general related to any of our indebtedness that bears interest at floating rates 

• increasing our exposure to currency fluctuations since a significant portion of our indebtedness is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar such as our euro and japanese yen denominated debt and 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt 

our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our future operating performance and financial results which will be subject in part to factors beyond our control including interest rates general economic financial and business conditions and impacts of the covid19 pandemic if we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our indebtedness including the repayment of significant nearterm indebtedness we may need to refinance all or part of our existing indebtedness borrow more money or sell securities or assets some or all of which may not be available to us at acceptable terms or at all in addition we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business although the terms of our credit agreements and our bond indentures allow us to incur additional debt this is subject to certain limitations which may preclude us from incurring the amount of indebtedness we otherwise desire 

although viatris expects to maintain an investment grade credit rating a downgrade in the credit rating of viatris or any indebtedness of viatris or its subsidiaries could increase the cost of further borrowings or refinancings of such indebtedness limit access to sources of financing in the future or lead to other adverse consequences 

if we incur additional debt the risks described above could intensify if global credit markets contract future debt financing may not be available to us when required or may not be available on acceptable terms or at all and as a result we may be unable to grow our business take advantage of business opportunities respond to competitive pressures or satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

from time to time we issue variable rate debt based on libor or undertake interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on libor on march 5 2021 the fca the regulatory supervisor of libor’s administrator announced the 

cessation or loss of representativeness of certain libor benchmark settings by the end of 2021 including the 

oneweek and twomonth us dollar libor settings with publication of the overnight and one three six and 12month us dollar libor settings ceasing at the end of june 2023 us federal banking agencies also issued a joint statement in november 2020 encouraging banks to stop using libor for new contracts as soon as possible but in any event by the end of the year as of december 31 2021 we had no outstanding debt linked to libor our credit facilities provide that should libor cease to exist we may amend the credit facilities to replace libor with i in the case of us dollars one or more rates based on sofr or ii another alternate benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similarly syndicated credit facilities syndicated in the us and denominated in the applicable currency for such alternative benchmarks and in each case including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar syndicated credit facilities syndicated in the us and denominated in the applicable currency for such benchmarks sofr or any other benchmark replacement may not be the economic equivalent of libor or achieve market acceptance similar to libor as a result our interest expense could increase in addition the overall financial market may be disrupted and there could be significant increases in benchmark rates or borrowing costs to borrowers as a result of the phaseout or replacement of libor disruption in the financial market significant increases in benchmark rates or borrowing costs or our inability to renegotiate agreements on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business financing activities financial condition and operations 

our credit facilities senior unsecured notes commercial paper program other outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur in the future impose or may impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability to among other things incur additional indebtedness make investments pay certain dividends prepay other indebtedness sell assets incur certain liens enter into agreements with our affiliates or restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends merge or consolidate in addition our credit facilities require us to maintain specified financial ratios a breach of any of these covenants or our inability to maintain the required financial ratios could result in a default under the related indebtedness if a default occurs the relevant lenders could elect to declare our indebtedness together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

there are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap any future changes in estimates judgments and assumptions used or necessary revisions to prior estimates judgments or assumptions or changes in accounting standards could lead to a restatement or revision to previously issued financial statements 

the consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements included in the periodic reports we file with the sec are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap involves making estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and income estimates judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future and any necessary revisions to prior estimates judgments or assumptions could lead to a restatement furthermore although we have recorded reserves for certain critical accounting estimates including litigation related contingencies based on estimates of probable future costs actual costs in the future could be substantially in excess of those reserves also any new or revised accounting standards may require adjustments to previously issued financial statements any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of liabilities revenues expenses and income and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we must maintain adequate internal controls and be able to provide an assertion as to the effectiveness of such controls on an annual basis 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports we spend a substantial amount of management and other employee time and resources to comply with laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure in the us such regulations include the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 sec regulations and the nasdaq listing standards in particular section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires management’s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestation as to the effectiveness of these controls by our independent registered public accounting firm during the third quarter of 2021 we began to transition certain support services from pfizer as well as certain subsidiaries to a new erp system we have modified and will continue to modify our internal controls relating to our business and financial processes throughout the transition period which is expected through the end of calendar year 2022 while we believe that this new system and the related changes to internal controls will ultimately strengthen our internal control over financial reporting there are inherent risks in implementing any new erp system if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting additionally internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud therefore even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

viatris could suffer additional losses due to asset impairment charges 

viatris has significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets on its balance sheet viatris tests goodwill for impairment during the second quarter of every fiscal year and on an interim date should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with asc 350 “goodwill and other intangible assets” if the fair value of a reporting unit is revised downward due to declines in business performance or other factors an impairment under asc 350 could result and a noncash charge could be required viatris tests intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable this assessment of the recoverability of intangible assets could result in an impairment and a noncash charge could be required such impairments could materially affect viatris’ reported net earnings business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

viatris may be adversely affected by disruptions in the credit markets including disruptions that reduce customers’ access to credit and increase the costs to customers of obtaining credit 

the credit markets have historically been volatile and therefore it is not possible to predict the ability of viatris’ customers to access shortterm financing and other forms of capital if a disruption in the credit markets were to occur viatris could be unable to refinance its outstanding indebtedness on reasonable terms or at all such a disruption could also pose a risk to viatris’ business if customers or suppliers are unable to obtain financing to meet their payment or delivery obligations in addition customers may decide to downsize defer or cancel contracts which could negatively affect our revenue 

further viatris had approximately 184 billion of floating rate debt as of december 31 2021 a one percentage point increase in the average interest rate of this debt would increase the combined interest expense by approximately 184 million per year accordingly a spike in interest rates would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

in connection with the combination viatris assumed or retained certain material obligations relating to defined benefit pension and termination benefits and retiree medical and dental benefits associated with legacy employees of the upjohn business andor sponsored by upjohn entities these liabilities and the related future funding obligations could restrict cash available for viatris’ operations capital expenditures dividend payments and other requirements and may materially adversely affect viatris’ financial condition and liquidity 

in connection with the combination viatris assumed material pension obligations associated with the upjohn business in particular viatris retained all liabilities relating to the puerto rico defined benefit pension plans and pfizer puerto rico retiree medical and dental plan in addition with respect to nonus defined benefit pension and termination benefit plans viatris generally established or designated plans similar to the pfizer plans to assume assets and liabilities for the benefit of legacy employees of the upjohn business viatris also retained liabilities for legacy employees of the upjohn business who participate in the japan defined benefit pension plan to the extent such employees were employed by the upjohn business on the date of the combination each of these liabilities and the related future payment obligations could restrict cash available for viatris’ operations capital expenditures dividend payments and other requirements and may materially affect viatris’ financial condition and liquidity 

general risks 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and the value of your investment could materially decline 

investors who hold shares of viatris common stock may not be able to sell their shares at or above the price at which they acquired them the price of viatris’ common stock may fluctuate materially from time to time including as a result of the other risks described herein and we cannot predict the price of our common stock at any given time in addition the stock market in general including the market for pharmaceutical companies has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations which may materially harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance in addition the price of our common stock may be affected by the valuations and recommendations of the analysts who cover us and if our results do not meet the analysts’ forecasts and expectations the price of our common stock could decline as a result of analysts lowering their valuations and recommendations or otherwise following periods of volatility in the market andor in the price of a company’s stock securities classaction litigation actions have been instituted against companies including mylan and viatris and may be instituted against us in the future such litigation may result in substantial costs and diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price in addition if we or our stockholders offer or sell shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock this or the possibility thereof may depress the future trading price of our common stock and the voting power of our then existing stockholders may be diluted if such a transaction were to occur 

the expansion of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges 

to the extent that we seek to use social media tools as a means to communicate about our products andor business there are uncertainties as to the rules that apply to such communications or as to the interpretations that authorities will apply to the rules that exist as a result despite our efforts to monitor evolving social media communication guidelines and comply with applicable rules there is risk that our use of social media for such purposes may cause us to be found in violation of them our employees may knowingly or inadvertently make use of social media tools in ways that may not be aligned with our social media strategy may give rise to liability or could lead to the loss of material nonpublic information trade secrets or other intellectual property or public exposure of personal information including sensitive personal information of our employees clinical trial patients customers and others in addition negative posts or comments about us on any social media website could damage our reputation any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition results of operations cash flows andor stock price 

provisions in the viatris charter and viatris bylaws and of applicable law may prevent or delay an acquisition of viatris which could decrease the trading price of viatris common stock 

the viatris charter viatris bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of deterring takeovers by making such takeovers more expensive to the acquiror and by encouraging prospective acquirors to negotiate with the viatris board rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include the division of the viatris board into three classes of directors until the 2023 annual meeting of viatris stockholders which could have the effect of making the replacement of incumbent directors more timeconsuming and difficult rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings and the right of the viatris board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between viatris and any holder of 15 or more of viatris’ outstanding common stock 

these provisions are intended to protect viatris’ stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with the viatris board and by providing the viatris board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make viatris immune from takeovers however these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that the viatris board determines is not in the best interests of viatris and its stockholders accordingly if the viatris board determines that a potential business combination transaction is not in the best interests of viatris and its stockholders but certain stockholders believe that such a transaction would be beneficial to viatris and its stockholders such stockholders may elect to sell their shares in viatris and the trading price of viatris common stock could decrease these and other provisions of the viatris charter the viatris bylaws and the dgcl could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a proxy contest tender offer merger or other change in control which may have a material adverse effect on viatris’ business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

the viatris charter designates the court of chancery of the state of delaware or if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction another state court of the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by viatris’ stockholders which could discourage lawsuits against viatris and its directors and officers 

the viatris charter provides that unless viatris through approval of the viatris board otherwise consents in writing the court of chancery of the state of delaware or if and only if the court of chancery of the state of delaware dismisses such action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction another state court sitting in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of viatris any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer or other employees of viatris to viatris or its stockholders creditors or other constituents any action asserting a claim against viatris or any of its directors officers or other employees arising pursuant to or seeking to enforce any right obligation or remedy under any provision of the dgcl or the viatris charter or the viatris bylaws as each may be amended from time to time any action or proceeding asserting a claim against viatris or any of its directors officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine or any action or proceeding as to which the dgcl as it may be amended from time to time confers jurisdiction on the court of chancery of the state of delaware 

to the fullest extent permitted by law this exclusive forum provision will apply to state and federal law claims including claims under the federal securities laws including the securities act and the exchange act however viatris stockholders will not be deemed to have waived viatris’ compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ charters and bylaws has been challenged in legal proceedings and it is possible that in connection with claims arising under federal securities laws or otherwise a court could find the exclusive forum provision contained in the viatris charter to be inapplicable or unenforceable 

this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of viatris’ stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with viatris or its directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against viatris or its directors or officers alternatively if a court were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above viatris may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions or forums which could materially and adversely affect viatris’ business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

our business and operations could be negatively affected by pressures from outside of the control of the company including but not limited to shareholder actions government regulations and disclosure requirements and other market dynamics which could cause us to incur significant expenses hinder execution of our business strategy and negatively impact our share price 

in recent years shareholder actions government regulations and disclosure requirements and other market dynamics involving corporate governance environmental and social matters human capital strategic direction and operations has become increasingly prevalent in the event we become the subject of shareholder challenges or more extensive government regulation or intervention in these areas this may create a significant distraction for our management and employees negatively impact our ability to execute our business plans require our management to expend significant time and resources create uncertainties with respect to our financial position and operations adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees or result in loss of potential business opportunities with our current and potential customers and business partners in addition such actions regulation and intervention may cause significant fluctuations in our share price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions uncertainties or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business which could cause the market value of our common stock to decline

certain market and industry factors 

the global pharmaceutical industry is a highly competitive and highly regulated industry as a result we face a number of industryspecific factors and challenges which can significantly impact our results the following discussion highlights some of these key factors and market conditions 

generic products particularly in the us generally contribute most significantly to revenues and gross margins at the time of their launch and even more so in periods of market exclusivity or in periods of limited generic competition as such the timing of new product introductions can have a significant impact on the company’s financial results the entrance into the market of additional competition generally has a negative impact on the volume and pricing of the affected products additionally pricing is often affected by factors outside of the company’s control conversely generic products generally experience less volatility over a longer period of time in europe as compared to the us primarily due to the role of government oversight of healthcare systems in the region 

for branded products the majority of the product’s commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market exclusivity in the us and some other countries when market exclusivity expires and generic versions of a product are approved and marketed there can often be very substantial and rapid declines in the branded product’s sales 

certain markets in which we do business outside of the us have undergone governmentimposed price reductions and further governmentimposed price reductions are expected in the future such measures along with the tender systems discussed below are likely to have a negative impact on sales and gross profit in these markets however government initiatives in certain markets that appear to favor generic products could help to mitigate this unfavorable effect by increasing rates of generic substitution and penetration 

additionally a number of markets in which we operate outside of the us have implemented or may implement tender systems for generic pharmaceuticals in an effort to lower prices generally speaking tender systems can have an unfavorable impact on sales and profitability under such tender systems manufacturers submit bids that establish prices for generic pharmaceutical products upon winning the tender the winning company will receive priority placement for a period of time the tender system often results in companies underbidding one another by proposing low pricing in order to win the tender the loss of a tender by a third party to whom we supply api can also have a negative impact on our sales and profitability sales continue to be negatively affected by the impact of tender systems in certain countries 

recent developments

2020 restructuring program 

during the fourth quarter of 2020 viatris announced a significant global restructuring program in order to achieve synergies and ensure that the organization is optimally structured and efficiently resourced to deliver sustainable value to patients shareholders customers and other stakeholders viatris’ restructuring initiative incorporates and expands on the restructuring program announced by mylan nv earlier in 2020 as part of its business transformation efforts as part of the restructuring the company is optimizing its commercial capabilities and enabling functions and closing downsizing or divesting certain manufacturing facilities globally that are deemed to be no longer viable either due to surplus capacity challenging market dynamics or a shift in its product portfolio toward more complex products 

for the committed restructuring actions the company expects to incur total pretax charges of up to approximately 14 billion such charges are expected to include up to approximately 450 million of noncash charges mainly related to accelerated depreciation and asset impairment charges including inventory writeoffs the remaining estimated cash costs of up to approximately 950 million are expected to be primarily related to severance and employee benefits expense as well as other costs including those related to contract terminations and other plant disposal costs in addition management believes the potential annual savings related to these committed restructuring activities to be up to approximately 900 million once fully implemented with most of these savings expected to improve operating cash flow 

impact of the coronavirus pandemic 

as a leading global pharmaceutical company viatris is committed to continue doing its part in support of public health needs amid the evolving covid19 pandemic the company’s priorities remain protecting the health and safety of our workforce continuing to produce critically needed medicines deploying resources and expertise in the fight against covid19 through potential prevention and treatment efforts supporting the communities in which we operate and maintaining the health of our overall business as a result many viatris administrative offices continue operating under work from home protocols and some of our customer facing field personnel continue on a remote engagement model to ensure continued support for healthcare professionals patient care and access to needed products additionally all of our manufacturing facilities and those of our key global partners are currently operational and at this time we are not experiencing any significant disruptions current inventory levels both ours and those in our distribution channel remain inline with normal levels 

the global spread of covid19 has created and continues to create significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption affecting the markets we serve including impacts on supply chain partners thirdparty manufacturers logistics providers and other vendors the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will impact our business operations and financial results in future periods will depend on numerous evolving factors that are beyond our control and that we may not be able to accurately predict and could adversely impact our results of operations in future periods due to the company’s ability to generate significant cash flows from operations combined with our access to borrowing facilities and capital markets we believe that we currently have and will maintain the ability to meet foreseeable liquidity needs  for additional information see results of operations in part ii item 7 

financial summary 

the table below is a summary of the company’s financial results for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior year period 



a detailed discussion of the company’s financial results can be found below in the section titled “results of operations” as part of this discussion we also report sales performance using the nongaap financial measures of “constant currency” net sales and total revenues these measures provide information on the change in net sales and total revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current period the comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency sales at the prior year’s foreign exchange rates we routinely evaluate our net sales and total revenues performance at constant currency so that sales results can be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rates thereby facilitating a periodtoperiod comparison of our operational activities and believe that this presentation also provides useful information to investors for the same reason 

more information about nongaap measures used by the company as part of this discussion including adjusted cost of sales adjusted gross margins adjusted net earnings and adjusted ebitda all of which are defined below are discussed further in this part ii item 7 under results of operations and results of operations — use of nongaap financial measures  

results of operations 

2021 compared to 2020 



 

1 currency impact is shown as unfavorable favorable 

2 the constant currency percentage change is derived by translating net sales or revenues for the current period at prior year comparative period exchange rates and in doing so shows the percentage change from 2021 constant currency net sales or revenues to the corresponding amount in the prior year 

3 for the year ended december 31 2021 other revenues in developed markets janz and emerging markets were approximately 510 million 15 million and 202 million respectively 

4 amounts exclude intersegment revenue which eliminates on a consolidated basis 

total revenues 

for the year ended december 31 2021 the company reported total revenues of 1789 billion compared to 1195 billion for the comparable prior year period representing an increase of 594 billion or 50 total revenues include both net sales and other revenues from third parties net sales for the year ended december 31 2021 were 1781 billion compared to 1182 billion for the comparable prior year period representing an increase of 599 billion or 51 other revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 were 727 million compared to 1261 million for the comparable prior year period a decrease of 534 million 

the increase in net sales was primarily driven by the incremental net sales from the upjohn business totaling 580 billion and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation primarily reflecting changes in the us dollar as compared to the currencies of subsidiaries in countries within the eu of approximately 2064 million or 2 new product sales of 6987 million were offset by a decrease in net sales from existing products as a result of lower pricing and volumes of 7109 million new product sales include new products launched in 2021 and the carryover impact of new products including business development launched within the last twelve months we estimate that the covid19 pandemic positively impacted our 2021 net sales compared to the prior year by approximately 2 primarily driven by a partial recovery of customer buying patterns in the current year 

from time to time a limited number of our products may represent a significant portion of our net sales gross profit and net earnings generally this is due to the timing of new product introductions and the amount if any of additional competition in the market our top ten products in terms of net sales in the aggregate represented approximately 33 and 23 for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively with the year over year increase a result of the combination this percentage may fluctuate based upon the timing of new product launches seasonality and the impact of competition 

net sales are derived from our four reporting segments developed markets greater china janz and emerging markets 

developed markets segment 

net sales from developed markets increased by 192 billion or 23 during the year ended december 31 2021 when compared to the prior year net sales within north america totaled approximately 459 billion and net sales within europe totaled approximately 584 billion this increase was primarily the result of the incremental net sales from the upjohn business in the current year of 183 billion and new product sales including the portfolio of thrombosis products in europe acquired from aspen in the fourth quarter of 2020 this increase was partially offset by lower pricing and volumes on net sales of existing products including wixela® inhub® perforomist® xulane® and miacalcin® within the us due to additional competition lower volumes were also due to the impact of product divestitures including certain north american otc products during the second quarter of 2021 and other products during 2020 as a result of the combination the favorable impact of foreign currency translation on current period net sales was approximately 1851 million or 2 constant currency net sales increased by approximately 173 billion or 20 when compared to the prior year 

greater china segment 

net sales from greater china increased by 195 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 when compared to the prior year this increase was primarily the result of the incremental net sales from the upjohn business of 193 billion the favorable impact of foreign currency translation was approximately 93 million or 4 constant currency net sales increased by approximately 194 billion when compared to the prior year 

janz segment 

net sales from janz increased by 8321 million or 70 for the year ended december 31 2021 when compared to the prior year this increase was primarily the result of the incremental net sales from the upjohn business of 6666 million and higher net sales of existing products driven by higher volumes primarily related to amitiza® and creon® as well as the impact of the termination of the collaboration arrangement with pfizer in the prior year in japan these increases were partially offset by lower pricing driven by government price reductions and product competition foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of approximately 27 million or less than 1 constant currency net sales increased by approximately 8294 million or 69 when compared to the prior year 

emerging markets segment 

net sales from emerging markets increased by 129 billion or 70 for the year ended december 31 2021 when compared to the prior year this increase was primarily the result of the incremental net sales from the upjohn business of 137 billion and covid19 related product sales in india primarily remdesivir and ambisome these increases were partially offset by lower volumes and to a lesser extent pricing as a result of customer purchasing patterns and competitive market conditions including for arv products the increase in net sales was partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of 93 million or less than 1 constant currency net sales increased by approximately 128 billion or 69 

cost of sales and gross profit 

cost of sales increased from 815 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 to 1231 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 cost of sales was primarily impacted by purchase accounting related amortization of acquired intangible assets and other special items which are described further in the section titled use of nongaap financial measures  additional incremental cost of sales from the upjohn business including the impact of amortization expense was 357 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 this includes incremental amortization expense of 201 billion primarily for purchase accounting related amortization of intangible assets and the fair value stepup of acquired inventory 

gross profit from net sales of existing products was impacted by lower pricing and to a lesser extent lower volumes gross margins were 31 and 32 for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively adjusted gross margins were approximately 59 and 54 for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively with the yearoveryear increase driven by the impact of the combination 

a reconciliation between cost of sales as reported under us gaap and adjusted cost of sales and adjusted gross margin for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 is as follows 



 

a adjusted gross profit is calculated as total revenues less adjusted cost of sales adjusted gross margin is calculated as adjusted gross profit divided by total revenues 

operating expenses 

research  development expense 

rd expense for the year ended december 31 2021 was 7511 million compared to 5551 million for the prior year an increase of 1960 million this increase was primarily due to additional incremental costs associated with the upjohn business of 817 million higher expenses related to licensing arrangements for products in development and increased costs for inventory validation batches for certain products under development 

selling general  administrative expense 

sga expense for the year ended december 31 2021 was 453 billion compared to 334 billion for the prior year an increase of 118 billion the increase was primarily due to additional incremental costs associated with the upjohn business of 121 billion and an increase of approximately 2364 million in restructuring costs due to the implementation of the 2020 restructuring program partially offsetting these increases were lower selling and promotional expenses including through our active management related to synergies and certain lower expenses as a result of covid19 in addition the company incurred lower acquisition related costs of approximately 3869 million as the prior year costs included approximately 2009 million for advisory and consulting fees related to the closing of the combination 3035 million related to the company’s obligation to reimburse pfizer for certain financing and transaction related costs under the bca and sda and approximately 693 million of employee related to change in control and retention amounts

interest expense 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2021 totaled 6362 million compared to 4978 million for the year ended december 31 2020 an increase of 1384 million the increase is primarily due to additional incremental interest expense related to the debt assumed in the combination of approximately 2476 million partially offset by amortization of debt premium of 601 million and by the impact of debt repayments in 2021 

other expense net 

other expense income net includes losses from equity affiliates foreign exchange gains and losses expense income related to postemployment benefit plans and interest and dividend income other expense income net was comprised of the following for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively

use of nongaap financial measures 

whenever the company uses nongaap financial measures we provide a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measures to their most directly comparable us gaap financial measure investors and other readers are encouraged to review the related us gaap financial measures and the reconciliation of nongaap measures to their most directly comparable us gaap measure and should consider nongaap measures only as a supplement to not as a substitute for or as a superior measure to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with us gaap additionally since these are not measures determined in accordance with us gaap nongaap financial measures have no standardized meaning across companies or as prescribed by us gaap and therefore may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures or measures with the same title used by other companies 

management uses these measures internally for forecasting budgeting measuring its operating performance and incentivebased awards primarily due to acquisitions and other significant events which may impact comparability of our periodic operating results we believe that an evaluation of our ongoing operations and comparisons of our current operations with historical and future operations would be difficult if the disclosure of our financial results was limited to financial measures prepared only in accordance with us gaap we believe that nongaap financial measures are useful supplemental information for our investors and when considered together with our us gaap financial measures and the reconciliation to the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our operations the financial performance of the company is measured by senior management in part using adjusted metrics as described below along with other performance metrics the company’s use of such nongaap measures is governed by an adjusted reporting policy maintained by the company and such nongaap measures are reviewed in detail with the audit committee of the board of directors 

adjusted cost of sales and adjusted gross margin 

we use the nongaap financial measure “adjusted cost of sales” and the corresponding nongaap financial measure “adjusted gross margin” the principal items excluded from adjusted cost of sales include restructuring acquisition related and other special items and purchase accounting related amortization which are described in greater detail below 

adjusted net earnings 

adjusted net earnings is a nongaap financial measure and provides an alternative view of performance used by management management believes that primarily due to acquisition activity and other significant events an evaluation of the company’s ongoing operations and comparisons of its current operations with historical and future operations would be difficult if the disclosure of its financial results were limited to financial measures prepared only in accordance with us gaap management believes that adjusted net earnings is an important internal financial metric related to the ongoing operating performance of the company and is therefore useful to investors and that their understanding of our performance is enhanced by this measure actual internal and forecasted operating results and annual budgets used by management include adjusted net earnings 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda are nongaap financial measures that the company believes are appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate the company’s ability to comply with financial debt covenants and assess the company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness the company also believes that adjusted ebitda better focuses management on the company’s underlying operational results and true business performance and is used in part for management’s incentive compensation we calculate ebitda as us gaap net earnings loss adjusted for net contribution attributable to equity method investments income tax provision benefit interest expense and depreciation and amortization ebitda is further adjusted for sharebased compensation expense litigation settlements and other contingencies net and restructuring acquisition related and other special items to determine adjusted ebitda these adjustments are generally permitted under our credit agreement in calculating adjusted ebitda for determining compliance with our debt covenants 

the significant items excluded from adjusted cost of sales adjusted net earnings and adjusted ebitda include 

purchase accounting amortization and other related items 

the ongoing impact of certain amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions of both businesses and assets is excluded from adjusted cost of sales adjusted net earnings and adjusted ebitda these amounts include the amortization of intangible assets inventory stepup property plant and equipment stepup and intangible asset impairment charges including for inprocess research and development for the acquisition of businesses accounted for under the provisions of asc 805 business combinations  these purchase accounting impacts are excluded regardless of the financing method used for the acquisitions including the use of cash longterm debt the issuance of common stock contingent consideration or any combination thereof 

upfront and milestonerelated rd expenses 

these expenses and payments are excluded from adjusted net earnings and adjusted ebitda because they generally occur at irregular intervals and are not indicative of the company’s ongoing operations 

accretion of contingent consideration liability and other fair value adjustments 

the impact of changes to the fair value of contingent consideration and accretion expense are excluded from adjusted net earnings and adjusted ebitda because they are not indicative of the company’s ongoing operations due to the variability of the amounts and the lack of predictability as to the occurrence andor timing and management believes their exclusion is helpful to understanding the underlying ongoing operational performance of the business 

sharebased compensation expense 

sharebased compensation expense is excluded from adjusted net earnings and adjusted ebitda our sharebased compensation programs have become increasingly weighted toward performancebased compensation which leads to variability and to a lack of predictability as to the occurrence andor timing of amounts incurred as such management believes the exclusion of such amounts on an ongoing basis is helpful to understanding the underlying operational performance of the business 

restructuring acquisition related and other special items 

costs related to restructuring acquisition and integration activities and other actions are excluded from adjusted cost of sales adjusted net earnings and adjusted ebitda as applicable these amounts include items such as 

• costs related to formal restructuring programs and actions including costs associated with facilities to be closed or divested employee separation costs impairment charges accelerated depreciation incremental manufacturing variances equipment relocation costs decommissioning and other restructuring related costs 

• certain acquisition related remediation and integration and planning costs as well as other costs associated with acquisitions such as advisory and legal fees certain financing related costs certain reimbursements related to the company’s obligation to reimburse pfizer for certain financing and transaction related costs under the bca and sda certain other tsa related exit costs and other business transformation andor optimization initiatives which are not part of a formal restructuring program including employee separation and postemployment costs 

• the pretax loss of the company’s clean energy investments whose activities qualify for income tax credits under the code only included in adjusted net earnings is the net tax effect of the entity’s activities 

• other costs incurred from time to time related to certain special events or activities that lead to gains or losses including but not limited to incremental manufacturing variances asset writedowns or liability adjustments 

• certain costs to further develop and optimize our global enterprise resource planning systems operations and supply chain and 

• the impact of changes related to uncertain tax positions and certain impacts related to the combination are excluded from adjusted net earnings in addition tax adjustments to adjusted earnings are recorded to present items on an aftertax basis consistent with the presentation of adjusted net earnings 

the company has undertaken restructurings and other optimization initiatives of differing types scope and amount during the covered periods and therefore these charges should not be considered nonrecurring however management excludes these amounts from adjusted net earnings and adjusted ebitda because it believes it is helpful to understanding the underlying ongoing operational performance of the business 

litigation settlements net 

charges and gains related to legal matters such as those discussed in note 19 litigation included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k are generally excluded from adjusted net earnings and adjusted ebitda normal ongoing defense costs of the company made in the normal course of our business are not excluded

other commitments 

the company is involved in various disputes governmental andor regulatory inquiries investigations and proceedings tax proceedings and litigation matters both in the us and abroad that arise from time to time some of which could result in losses including damages fines andor civil penalties andor criminal charges against the company these matters are often complex and have outcomes that are difficult to predict we have approximately 609 million accrued for legal contingencies at december 31 2021 

while the company believes that it has meritorious defenses with respect to the claims asserted against it and the assumed legal matters referenced above and intends to vigorously defend its position the process of resolving these matters is inherently uncertain and may develop over a long period of time and so it is not possible to predict the ultimate resolution of any such matter it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of any of the ongoing matters could have a material effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

in conjunction with the combination viatris entered into a tsa with pfizer pursuant to which each party will provide certain limited transition services to the other party generally for an initial period of 24 months from closing date of the combination in addition to the monthly service fees under the tsa viatris has agreed to reimburse pfizer for fifty percent of the costs up to the first 380 million incurred to establish and wind down the tsa services viatris will be required to fully reimburse pfizer for total costs in excess of 380 million during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 the company incurred 304 million and 531 million respectively related to this provision of the tsa and approximately 835 million during the period beginning on the closing date of the combination and ended december 31 2021

in the normal course of business viatris periodically enters into employment legal settlement and other agreements which incorporate indemnification provisions while the maximum amount to which viatris may be exposed under such agreements cannot be reasonably estimated the company maintains insurance coverage which management believes will effectively mitigate the company’s obligations under these indemnification provisions no amounts have been recorded in the consolidated financial statements with respect to the company’s obligations under such agreements 

we have entered into employment and other agreements with certain executives and other employees that provide for compensation and certain other benefits these agreements provide for severance payments under certain circumstances 

licensing and other partner agreements 

under our licensing and other partner agreements our potential maximum development milestones not accrued for at december 31 2021 totaled approximately 351 million we estimate that the amounts that may be paid during the next twelve months to be approximately 18 million additionally these agreements may also include potential salesbased milestones and call for us to pay a percentage of amounts earned from the sale of the product as a royalty or a profit share refer to note 18 licensing and other partner agreements included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional information 

application of critical accounting policies 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k and are in accordance with us gaap 

included within these policies are certain policies which contain critical accounting estimates and therefore have been deemed to be “critical accounting policies” critical accounting estimates are those which require management to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and for which the use of different estimates which reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations we have identified the following to be our critical accounting policies the determination of net revenue provisions acquisitions intangible assets goodwill and contingent consideration income taxes and the impact of existing legal matters 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenues in accordance with asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers  under asc 606 the company recognizes net revenue for product sales when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services revenues are recorded net of provisions for variable consideration including discounts rebates governmental rebate programs price adjustments returns chargebacks promotional programs and other sales allowances accruals for these provisions are presented in the consolidated financial statements as reductions in determining net sales and as a contra asset in accounts receivable net if settled via credit and other current liabilities if paid in cash amounts recorded for revenue deductions can result from a complex series of judgements about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions as such they have been identified as critical accounting estimates the following section briefly describes the nature of our provisions for variable consideration and how such provisions are estimated 

• chargebacks  the company has agreements with certain indirect customers such as independent pharmacies retail pharmacy chains managed care organizations hospitals nursing homes governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers which establish contract prices for certain products the indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products at these contracted prices alternatively certain wholesalers may enter into agreements with indirect customers that establish contract pricing for certain products which the wholesalers provide under either arrangement viatris will provide credit to the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect party and the wholesaler’s invoice price such credits are called chargebacks the provision for chargebacks is based on expected sellthrough levels by our wholesaler customers to indirect customers as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels we continually monitor our provision for chargebacks and evaluate our reserve and estimates as additional information becomes available a change of 5 would have an effect on our reserve balance of approximately 296 million 

• rebates promotional programs and other sales allowances  this category includes rebate and other programs to assist in product sales these programs generally provide that the customer receives credit directly related to the amount of purchases or credits upon the attainment of preestablished volumes also included in this category are prompt pay discounts administrative fees and price adjustments to reflect decreases in the selling prices of products a change of 5 would have an effect on our reserve balance of approximately 687 million 

• returns  consistent with industry practice viatris maintains a return policy that allows customers to return a product which varies country by country in accordance with local practices generally within a specified period prior six months and subsequent twelve months to the expiration date the company’s estimate of the provision for returns is generally based upon historical experience with actual returns generally returned products are destroyed and customers are refunded the sales price in the form of a credit a change of 5 would have an effect on our reserve balance of approximately 343 million 

• governmental rebate programs  government reimbursement programs in the us include medicare medicaid and state pharmacy assistance programs established according to statute regulations and policy manufacturers of pharmaceutical products that are covered by the medicaid program are required to pay rebates to each state based on a statutory formula set forth in the social security act medicare beneficiaries are eligible to obtain discounted prescription drug coverage from private sector providers in addition certain states have also implemented supplemental rebate programs that obligate manufacturers to pay rebates in excess of those required under federal law our estimate of these rebates is based on the historical trends of rebates paid as well as on changes in wholesaler inventory levels and increases or decreases in the level of sales we estimate discounts on branded prescription drug sales to medicare part d participants in the medicare “coverage gap” based on historical experience of prescriptions and utilization expected to result in the discount of the “coverage gap” 

outside the us the majority of our pharmaceutical sales are contractually or legislatively governed in certain european countries certain rebates are calculated on the governments total pharmaceutical spending or on specific product sale thresholds we utilize historical data and obtain third party information to determine the adequacy of these accruals also this provision includes price reductions that are mandated by law outside of the us 

a change of 5 would have an effect on our reserve balance of approximately 200 million 

the following is a rollforward of the categories of variable consideration during 2021 



accruals for these provisions are presented in the consolidated financial statements as reductions in determining net revenues and in accounts receivable and other current liabilities accounts receivable are presented net of allowances relating to these provisions which were comprised of the following at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 



we have not made and do not anticipate making any significant changes to the methodologies that we use to measure provisions for variable consideration however the balances within these reserves can fluctuate significantly through the consistent application of our methodologies historically we have not recorded in any current period any material amounts related to adjustments made to prior period reserves 

acquisitions intangible assets goodwill and contingent consideration 

the company accounts for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the provisions of asc 805 business combinations  which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values the cost to acquire businesses is allocated to the underlying net assets of the acquired business based on estimates of their respective fair values amounts allocated to acquired iprd are capitalized at the date of acquisition and at that time such iprd assets have indefinite lives as products in development are approved for sale amounts are allocated to product rights and licenses and will be amortized over their estimated useful lives finitelived intangible assets are amortized over the expected life of the asset any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill refer to note 4 acquisitions and other transactions included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further additional information regarding the company’s acquisitions including the acquisition accounting related to the combination 

purchases of developed products and licenses that are accounted for as asset acquisitions are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized over an estimated useful life iprd assets acquired as part of an asset acquisition are expensed immediately if they have no alternative future uses 

the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as asset lives can materially impact our results of operations fair values and useful lives are determined based on among other factors the expected future period of benefit of the asset the various characteristics of the asset and projected cash flows because this process involves management making estimates with respect to future sales volumes pricing new product launches government reform actions anticipated cost environment and overall market conditions and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded these estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates 

the company records contingent consideration resulting from business acquisitions at its estimated fair value on the acquisition date each reporting period thereafter the company revalues these obligations and records increases or decreases in their fair value as adjustments to litigation settlements and other contingencies net within the consolidated statements of operations changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to the discount rates payment periods and adjustments in the probability of achieving future development steps regulatory approvals market launches sales targets and profitability these fair value measurements represent level 3 measurements as they are based on significant inputs not observable in the market 

significant judgment is employed in determining the assumptions utilized as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent measurement period accordingly changes in the assumptions described above could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

the company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable based on management’s assessment of the fair value of the company’s reporting units as compared to their related carrying value under the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test if we choose to use qualitative factors and determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then the goodwill impairment test would be required the goodwill impairment test requires the company to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount is less than its fair value then no impairment is recognized if the carrying amount recorded exceeds the fair value calculated an impairment charge is recorded for the difference the judgments made in determining the projected cash flows used to estimate the fair value can materially impact the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of april 1 2021 on a quantitative basis for its five reporting units north america europe emerging markets janz and greater china additionally the net assets acquired as part of the combination were included in the respective reporting units and in the annual impairment test for the first time in estimating each reporting unit’s fair value the company performed an extensive valuation analysis utilizing both income and marketbased approaches the determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting unit’s expected future cash flows these estimates and assumptions utilizing level 3 inputs primarily include but are not limited to market multiples control premiums the discount rate terminal growth rates operating income before depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures forecasts the following describes the valuation methodologies used to derive the estimated fair value of the reporting units 

income approach  under this approach to determine fair value we discounted the expected future cash flows of each reporting unit we used a discount rate which reflected the overall level of inherent risk and the rate of return an outside investor would have expected to earn to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of our model we used a terminal value approach under this approach we used ebitda in the final year of our model adjusted to estimate a normalized cash flow applied a perpetuity growth assumption and discounted by a perpetuity discount factor to determine the terminal value we incorporated the present value of the resulting terminal value into our estimate of fair value 

marketbased approach  the company also utilizes a marketbased approach to estimate fair value principally utilizing the guideline company method which focuses on comparing our risk profile and growth prospects to a select group of publicly traded companies with reasonably similar guidelines 

as of april 1 2021 the allocation of the company’s total goodwill was as follows north america 366 billion europe 515 billion emerging markets 158 billion janz 082 billion and greater china 070 billion 

as of april 1 2021 the company determined that the fair value of the north america emerging markets and greater china reporting units was substantially in excess of the respective unit’s carrying value 

for the europe reporting unit the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 091 billion or 58 for the annual goodwill impairment test as it relates to the income approach for the europe reporting unit at april 1 2021 the company forecasted cash flows for the next 10 years during the forecast period the revenue compound annual growth rate was approximately 30 a terminal year value was calculated with a 09 revenue growth rate applied the discount rate utilized was 105 and the estimated tax rate was 190 under the marketbased approach we utilized an estimated range of market multiples of 75 to 85 times ebitda plus a control premium of 150 if all other assumptions are held constant a reduction in the terminal value growth rate by 29 or an increase in discount rate by 15 would result in an impairment charge for the europe reporting unit 

for the janz reporting unit the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 023 billion or 70 for the annual goodwill impairment test as it relates to the income approach for the janz reporting unit at april 1 2021 the company forecasted cash flows for the next 10 years during the forecast period the revenue compound annual growth rate was approximately negative 15 a terminal year value was calculated with a 07 revenue growth rate applied the discount rate utilized was 85 and the estimated tax rate was 305 under the marketbased approach we utilized an estimated market multiple of 60 times ebitda plus a control premium of 150 if all other assumptions are held constant a reduction in the terminal value growth rate by 42 or an increase in discount rate by 20 would result in an impairment charge for the janz reporting unit 

due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates actual results could differ from those estimates in addition changes in underlying assumptions especially as they relate to the key assumptions detailed could have a significant impact on the fair value of the reporting units 

the carrying values of longlived assets which include property plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated periodically in relation to the expected future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying assets and monitored for other potential triggering events we have assessed the recoverability of certain longlived assets principally finitelived intangible assets contained within the reporting units whenever certain impairment indicators are present any impairment of these assets must be considered prior to our impairment review of goodwill the assessment for impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the longlived assets or asset grouping by analyzing the expected future undiscounted pretax cash flows specific to the asset or asset grouping if the carrying amount is greater than the undiscounted cash flows the company recognizes an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows 

significant management judgment is involved in estimating the recoverability of these assets and is dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions used in making these estimates as well as how the estimates compare to the eventual future operating performance of the specific asset or asset grouping for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 the company recorded 834 million related to the sale of a group of otc products in the us 450 million and 423 million respectively of impairment charges for finitelived intangible assets which were recorded as a component of amortization expense at december 31 2021 and 2020 the company’s finitelived intangible assets totaled 2609 billion and 2960 billion respectively changes to any of the company’s assumptions related to the estimated fair value based on the discounted cash flows including discount rates or the competitive environment related to the assets could lead to future material impairment charges any future longlived assets impairment charges could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s indefinitelived intangible assets principally iprd are tested at least annually for impairment or upon the occurrence of a triggering event the impairment test for iprd consists of a comparison of the asset’s fair value with its carrying value impairment is determined to exist when the fair value of iprd assets which is based upon updated forecasts and commercial development plans is less than the carrying value of the assets being tested for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 the company recorded 194 million 374 million and 1383 million respectively of impairment charges which were recorded as a component of amortization expense at december 31 2021 and 2020 the company’s iprd assets totaled 465 million and 807 million respectively 

the fair value of both iprd and finitelived intangible assets was determined based upon detailed valuations employing the income approach which utilized level 3 inputs as defined in note 9 financial instruments and risk management included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k changes to any of the company’s assumptions including changes to or abandonment of development programs regulatory timelines discount rates or the competitive environment related to the assets could lead to future material impairment charges 

income taxes 

we compute our income taxes based on the statutory tax rates and tax reliefs available to viatris in the various jurisdictions in which we generate income significant judgment is required in determining our income taxes and in evaluating our tax positions we establish reserves in accordance with viatris’ policy regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes our policy provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position be recognized in viatris’ financial statements only if the position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the position we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the settlement of a tax audit our provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our provision for income taxes in the period of resolution or expiration of the underlying statutes of limitation based on this evaluation as of december 31 2021 our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits totaled 3229 million of which 2640 million was recorded in connection with the combination and is subject to pfizer’s indemnification obligations to viatris under the tax matters agreement 

management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets a significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred in certain taxing jurisdictions over the threeyear period ended december 31 2021 such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for future growth 

based on this evaluation and other factors as of december 31 2021 a valuation allowance of 7804 million has been recorded in order to measure only the portion of the deferred tax asset that more likely than not will be realized the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable however could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as projections for growth when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers all available evidence including historical information longterm forecasts of future taxable income and possible tax planning strategies amounts recorded for valuation allowances can result from a complex series of estimates assumptions and judgments about future events due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates assumptions and judgments actual results could differ materially any future increases to the company’s valuation allowances could materially impact the company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations at december 31 2021 and 2020 the company’s net deferred tax assets totaled 133 billion and 215 billion respectively 

a variance of 5 between estimated reserves and valuation allowances and actual resolution and realization of these tax items would have an effect on our reserve balance and valuation allowance of approximately 551 million 

legal matters 

viatris is involved in various legal proceedings some of which involve claims for substantial amounts an estimate is made to accrue for a loss contingency relating to any of these legal proceedings if it is probable that a liability was incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated because of the subjective nature inherent in assessing the outcome of litigation and because of the potential that an adverse outcome in a legal proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows andor ordinary share price such estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates 

a variance of 5 between estimated and recorded litigation reserves and actual resolution of certain legal matters would have an effect on our litigation reserve balance of approximately 304 million refer to note 19 litigation included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of litigation matters 

impact of currency fluctuations and inflation 

because our results are reported in us dollars changes in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the local currencies in the markets in which we operate mainly the euro indian rupee chinese renminbi japanese yen australian dollar canadian dollar pound sterling and south korean won affect our results as previously noted we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our revenues or results of operations in any of the past three years 

recent accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

a significant portion of our revenues and earnings are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we seek to manage this foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities 

from time to time foreign exchange risk is managed through the use of foreign currency forwardexchange contracts these contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency assets and liabilities that arise from operations and from intercompany loans any unhedged foreign exchange exposures continue to be subject to market fluctuations 

our financial instrument holdings at year end were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes the fair values of these instruments were determined as follows 

• foreign currency forwardexchange contracts — net present values 

• foreign currency denominated receivables payables debt and loans — changes in exchange rates 

in this sensitivity analysis we assumed that the change in one currency’s rate relative to the us dollar would not have an effect on other currencies’ rates relative to the us dollar all other factors were held constant 

if there were an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates of 10 the expected net effect on net income related to viatris’ foreign currency denominated financial instruments would not be material 

the company is also exposed to translation risk on nonus dollardenominated net assets nonus dollar borrowings principally our euro and yen denominated longterm debt are used to hedge the foreign currency exposures of our net investment in certain foreign affiliates and are designated as hedges of net investments the foreign exchange gains or losses on these hedges is included in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss if our net investment decreases below the equivalent value of the nonus debt borrowings the change in the remeasurement basis of the debt would be subject to recognition in net income as changes occur 

interest rate and longterm debt risk 

viatris’ exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from our us dollar and euro borrowings and us dollar investments we invest primarily on a variablerate basis and we borrow on both a fixed and variable basis in order to maintain a certain ratio of fixed to variable rate debt from time to time depending on market conditions viatris will use derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to fix interest rates on variablerate borrowings or to convert fixedrate borrowings to variable interest rates 

as of december 31 2021 viatris’ outstanding fixed rate borrowings consist principally of 2060 billion notional amount of senior us dollar and euro notes generally the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall as of december 31 2021 the fair value of our outstanding fixed rate senior us dollar and euro notes was approximately 2201 billion a 100 basis point change in interest rates on viatris’ variable rate debt net of interest rate swaps would result in a change in interest expense of approximately 184 million per year

operations 

we have developed endtoend experience across the total product life cycle which includes global regulatory licensing launch growth and postapproval lifecycle management our research development and medical platform seeks to maximize the impact of our existing product portfolio by examining whether there is an opportunity for new indications label extensions product formulations and market registrations for our products we also use our platform to determine whether there is an opportunity to integrate new products into our portfolio 

the manufacturing of apis and finished dosage forms is performed by a combination of internal and external manufacturing operations with much of our manufacturing being vertically integrated this means we produce many of our own apis and finished dosage forms occasionally however resources we need are available from only a single supplier like many pharmaceutical companies we supplement our production footprint through arrangements with other manufacturers 

the company’s significant manufacturing warehousing and distribution activities are located primarily in the us puerto rico singapore certain eu countries including ireland india japan and china in addition we maintain administrative facilities around the world while many of these key facilities are owned viatris also leases certain facilities from third parties 

we believe all our facilities are in good operating condition the machinery and equipment are wellmaintained the facilities are suitable for their intended purposes and they have capacities adequate for the current operations 

facilities and records related to our products are subject to periodic inspection by the fda the ema and other regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where our products are marketed in addition authorities often conduct preapproval plant inspections to determine whether our systems and processes comply with current gmp and other regulations and clinicaltrial reviews to evaluate regulatory compliance and data integrity our suppliers contract manufacturers clinical trial partners and other business partners are subject to similar regulations and periodic inspections the company remains committed to maintaining the highest quality manufacturing standards at its facilities around the world and to continuous assessment and improvement in a time of evolving industry dynamics and regulatory expectations 

we are committed to environmentally responsible conduct and have policies and procedures to support our work to systematically and diligently minimize our environmental footprint our integrated comprehensive approach focuses on managing our water air emissions waste climate change and energy impact while it is impossible to predict accurately the future costs associated with environmental compliance and potential remediation activities compliance with environmental laws is not expected to require significant capital expenditures and has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our operations or competitive position 

customers and marketing 

numbering more than 60000 our customers include retail and pharmacy establishments wholesalers and distributors payers insurers and governments and institutions such as hospitals among others see “channel types” below for more information about our customers 

the table below displays the percentage of consolidated net sales to our largest customers during the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



as a result of the combination we estimate that the percentages to our significant customers could change in future periods 

we serve our customers through a team of approximately 14000 sales and marketing professionals all of whom are focused on establishing viatris as our customers’ partner of choice to best meet customers’ needs the company manages its business on a geographic basis 

in addition to being dynamic the pharmaceutical industry is complex how it functions how it is regulated and how it provides patients access varies by location similarly competition is affected by many factors examples of factors include innovation and development timely approval of prescription drugs by health authorities manufacturing capabilities product quality marketing effectiveness portfolio size customer service consumer acceptance product price political stability and the availability of funding for healthcare 

certain parts of our business also are affected by seasonality eg due to the timing and severity of peak cough cold and flu incidence which can cause variability in sales trends for some of our products while seasonality may affect quarterly comparisons within a fiscal year it generally is not material to our annual consolidated results 

for these and other reasons the company’s sales and marketing efforts vary accordingly by product market and channel type each of which is described below 

see the application of critical accounting policies section in part ii item 7 of this form 10k for more information related to customer arrangements

viatris markets prescription brand drugs generic drugs complex generics biosimilars and apis 

brand drugs typically are prescription pharmaceuticals that are sufficiently novel as to be protected by patents or other forms of exclusivity as such these drugs which bear trade names may be produced and sold only by those owning the rights subject to certain challenges that other companies may make developing new medicines can take years and significant investment only a few promising therapies ever enter clinical trials fewer still are approved for sale by health authorities at which point marketing to healthcare providers and consumers begins because patents and exclusivities last many years they serve as an incentive to developers during the periods protected developers often recoup their investments and earn a profit in many highincome countries the brand business often is characterized by higher margins on lower volumes  especially as compared with generic manufacturers viatris has numerous branded drugs including iconic brands as well as several global key brands to help patients manage their health brand drugs include branded generics which are offpatent products that are sold under an approved proprietary name for marketing purposes brand products often become branded generics once patent protections or other forms of exclusivity expire branded generic products are common in many countries outside the us including emerging markets brand product and branded generic products are more sensitive to promotion than are unbranded generic products they therefore represent the primary focus of most of our sales representatives and productlevel marketing activity our otc products which are sold directly to consumers without a prescription and without reimbursement are generally sold under a brand name 

generic drugs are therapeutically equivalent versions of brand drugs generics generally become available once the patents and other exclusivities on their branded counterparts expire the generics business is generally characterized by lower margins on higher volumes of a relatively large number of products our generic medicines which include complex and branded generics work in the same way and provide the same clinical benefits as their as their brandname counterparts and may cost less providing patients and the healthcare system important savings and medicine options which we believe are essential to making healthcare accessible the manufacturing of generic medicines is held to the same standards of gmp by health authorities as the manufacturing of branded medicines national health authorities inspect our facilities around the world to ensure that generic manufacturing packaging and testing sites pass the same quality standards as those of brand drugs gx products typically are sold under their inns inns facilitate the identification of pharmaceutical substances or apis each inn is unique and globally recognized a nonproprietary name also is known as a generic name 

complex generic drugs are generic medicines that could have a complex active ingredient complex formulation complex route of delivery or complex drug device combinations viatris offers a number of these important medicines to patients including our wixela® inhub® the first generic of advair diskus® and glatiramer acetate injection a generic version of copaxone® for example 

biosimilars are approved by regulatory authorities as highly similar to the originally approved brand version with no clinically meaningful differences in safety or efficacy biosimilar versions are increasingly available as therapeutic alternatives for patients facing many serious diseases including diabetes autoimmune disorders and multiple cancers we offer one of the industry’s largest and most diverse global biosimilars franchises with approximately 150 marketing authorizations in over 85 countries focused on the areas of oncology immunology endocrinology ophthalmology and dermatology these vital products can help increase access for current and future patients while supporting the sustainability of healthcare systems and we continue to invest in bringing more to market as we believe more than twothirds of the products we will launch in the coming years will be either complex generics or biosimilars biosimilars often are marketed under a brandname viatris offers one of the industry’s largest and most diverse global biosimilars franchises including fulphila® ogivri® and hulio™ 

apis are responsible for the therapeutic effects of medicines we are one of the world’s largest producers of apis providing them to customers in more than 100 countries we are the leading producer of api used in generic antiretrovirals which treat hivaids we also produce api for products in the following areas antibacterial central nervous system agents antihistaminesantiasthmatics cardiovascular antivirals antidiabetics antifungals and proton pump inhibitors our api is sold through a dedicated sales and marketing team primarily to pharmaceutical companies throughout the world 

viatris invests significant sums in rd and in manufacturing capacity we also often incur substantial litigation expense as a result of defending or challenging brand patents or exclusivities 

market types 

viatris focuses its sales and marketing efforts on the people who make key decisions around pharmaceutical prescribing dispensing or buying decisionmakers vary by country or region reflecting law and custom giving rise to different types of pharmaceutical markets many countries feature a mix of or hybrids of various market types though the company may focus on just one type 

in prescription markets physicians decide which medicines patients will take pharmacies then dispense the products as directed drug companies employ sales forces to educate doctors about the clinical benefits of their products representatives call on individual doctors or group practices the process is known as detailing examples of countries served by viatris that are mainly prescription markets are us brand business japan china russia turkey poland and mexico 

in substitution markets pharmacists generally are authorized and in some cases required by law to dispense an unbranded or branded generic if available in place of a brandname medicine or vice versa drug companies may use sales forces in these markets too with representatives calling on and educating pharmacy personnel about their organization and products examples of countries served by viatris that are mainly substitution markets are france italy spain portugal and australia 

in tender markets payers such as governments or insurance companies negotiate the lowest price for a drug or group of drugs on behalf of their constituents or members in exchange the chosen supplier’s product is placed on the payer’s formulary or list of covered prescriptions often a supplier’s drug is the only one available in an entire class of drugs large sales forces are not needed to reach these decisionmakers examples of generic markets served by viatris that are mainly tender markets are new zealand sweden and south africa 

in distribution markets retailers and wholesalers make drugpurchasing decisions large sales forces are not needed to reach the decisionmakers representing these organizations note however that pharmacists operating in distribution markets also may be authorized to make substitution decisions when dispensing medicines examples of countries served by viatris that are mainly distribution markets are the us generics business the uk and norway 

the allocation of our sales and marketing resources reflects the characteristics of these different market types 

in the case of otc products consumers are the decisionmakers otc products are commonly sold via retail channels such as pharmacies drugstores and supermarkets this makes their sale and marketing comparable to other retail businesses with broad advertising and tradechannel promotion consumers often are loyal to wellknown otc brands for this reason suppliers of otc products viatris included must invest the time and resources needed to build strong otc brand names 

channel types 

viatris’ products make their way to patients through a variety of intermediaries or channels 

pharmaceutical wholesalersdistributors purchase prescription medicines and other medical products directly from manufacturers for storage in warehouses and distribution centers the distributors then fill orders placed by healthcare providers and other authorized buyers 

pharmaceutical retailers purchase products directly from manufacturers or wholesalersdistributors they then sell them to consumers in relatively small quantities for personal use 

institutional pharmacies address the unique needs of hospitals nursing homes and other such venues among the services provided are specialized packaging including for injectables and unitdose products for controlled administration 

mailorder and ecommerce pharmacies receive prescriptions by mail fax phone or the internet at a central location process them in large mostly automated centers and mail the drugs to the consumer 

specialty pharmacies focus on managing the handling and service requirements associated with highcost and morecomplex drug therapies such as those used to treat patients with rare or serious diseases

government regulation 

regulation by governmental authorities is a significant factor in the rd manufacture marketing sales and distribution of pharmaceuticals human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing to gather data to support approval which requires extensive data and information manufacturing is conducted under exacting conditions governed by extensive regulation and postapproval activities such as advertising and promotion and pharmacovigilance are subject to extensive regulation 

the lengthy process of developing products and obtaining required approvals and the continuing need for postapproval compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources regulatory approval if and when obtained may be limited in scope further approved drugs as well as their manufacturers are subject to ongoing postmarketing review and inspection which can lead to the discovery of previously unknown problems with products or the manufacturing or quality control procedures used in their production which may result in restrictions on their manufacture sale or use or in their withdrawal from the market 

any failure or delay by us our suppliers of manufactured drug product collaborators or licensees in obtaining regulatory approvals could adversely affect the marketing of our products and our ability to receive product revenue license revenue or profitsharing payments 

other regulatory requirements 

our business is subject to a wide range of various other federal state nongovernmental and local agency rules and regulations they focus on fraud and corruption pricing and reimbursement data privacy and the environment among many other considerations for more information about certain of these regulations and the associated risks we face see part i item 1a “risk factors” of this form 10k

combination risks 

the integration of the upjohn business with mylan following the combination as well as our global restructuring program may present significant challenges 

the combination of two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process and there is a significant degree of difficulty inherent in the process of integrating the upjohn business and mylan these difficulties include 

• diversion of management’s attention from the ongoing operations of viatris to integration and restructuring matters 

• the challenge of integrating the employees and business cultures of the upjohn business and mylan 

• retaining existing customers and suppliers or obtaining new customers and suppliers 

• risks associated with managing a larger and more complex company 

• the challenge and cost of integrating manufacturing logistics information technology communications and other systems of the upjohn business and mylan 

• the potential difficulty retaining key personnel and other employees of mylan and the upjohn business 

• challenges in reducing reliance on certain transition services provided by pfizer prior to the expiration of any period in which such services are provided and 

• reducing costs associated with the transition services provided by pfizer 

in addition to integration activities with respect to mylan and the upjohn business on november 16 2020 viatris announced a significant global restructuring program in order to achieve specified synergies over the next four years or sooner and ensure the new company is optimally structured and efficiently resourced to deliver sustainable value to patients shareholders customers and other stakeholders this viatris restructuring program incorporates and expands upon a prior mylan restructuring program on december 11 2020 and february 25 2021 viatris disclosed additional details related to this global restructuring program that may impact up to 20 of its global workforce and includes the closing downsizing or divesting of up to 15 manufacturing facilities 

the process of integrating operations and implementing restructuring initiatives could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of one or more of viatris’ businesses these integration and restructuring processes are ongoing and members of viatris’ senior management are required to devote considerable amounts of time to these processes which could decrease the time they have to manage and service viatris’ businesses and develop new products or strategies there is no assurance that viatris will be able to manage this integration or restructuring in the manner or on the timelines currently anticipated if our senior management is not able to timely and effectively manage these integration or restructuring processes significant business activities are interrupted or there is a delay or inability to achieve anticipated integration or restructuring goals viatris may not be able to achieve its synergy targets and there could be a material adverse effect on viatris’ business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

viatris may not realize the anticipated benefits from the combination or its global restructuring program 

viatris is expected to realize synergies growth opportunities and other financial and operating benefits as a result of the combination viatris’ success in realizing these benefits and the timing of their realization depends on the successful integration of the upjohn business with mylan as well as the success of our global restructuring program see “ the integration of the upjohn business with mylan following the combination as well as our global restructuring program may present significant challenges ” above even if the integration and restructuring program are successful we may not achieve these synergies growth opportunities and other financial and operating benefits within the timeline we anticipate or at all for 

example the benefits from the combination may be offset by significant costs incurred in connection with our global restructuring program and the combination including integration and postclosing costs costs associated with our tsas with pfizer and capital expenditures which could be higher than currently estimated the quantification of synergies expected to result from the combination is based on significant estimates and assumptions that are subjective in nature and inherently uncertain realization of any benefits and synergies could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control including without limitation general economic conditions increased operating costs regulatory developments and the other risks described in these risk factors in addition our ability to achieve our synergy targets depends in large part on the successful implementation of the initiatives under our global restructuring program which may not achieve their intended goals the amount of synergies actually realized as a result of the combination if any and the time periods in which any such synergies are realized could differ materially from our current expectations and estimates regardless of whether the two business operations are combined successfully in addition if key personnel and other employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration activities viatris’ ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the combination could be reduced if the integration or our global restructuring program are unsuccessful if the estimated costs are higher than anticipated or if we are unable to realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the combination there could be a material adverse effect on viatris’ business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

viatris could incur operational difficulties or losses if pfizer is unable to perform under the agreements entered into as part of the combination if we are unable to obtain the same types and level of services and resources that historically have been provided to the legacy upjohn business by pfizer or if we are required to make payments to pfizer pursuant to indemnities agreed to as part of the combination 

in connection with the combination viatris entered into several agreements with pfizer or its subsidiaries including among others transition services and the manufacturing and supply agreements which in general provide for the performance of certain services or obligations by each of pfizer and viatris for the benefit of each other for a transitional period following the combination if either party is unable to satisfy its obligations under such agreements in a timely manner or at all or if the transitional agreements fail to provide for or cover certain essential services needed by viatris during the applicable transitional period we have limited recourse and could incur operational difficulties or losses or face liability 

in particular the legacy upjohn business historically received benefits and services from pfizer viatris no longer benefits from pfizer’s services or business relationships to the extent not otherwise addressed in the definitive documents entered into in connection with the combination while pfizer has agreed to provide certain transition services to viatris for a transitional period following the combination such services may not provide benefits equivalent to the services provided when the upjohn business was operating as a part of pfizer viatris may not be able to adequately replace resources formerly provided by pfizer or replace such services at the same or lower cost viatris may also need to make significant investments to replicate or outsource from other providers certain facilities systems infrastructure and personnel to which it no longer has access and may incur significant costs to replace such services in addition we may experience operational disruptions associated with ending the transition services that pfizer has agreed to provide viatris under the transition agreements as viatris transitions off of and attempts to replace these services further because viatris is reliant on pfizer for such services during the transitional period any interruption disruption or breach of pfizer’s systems relating to such services including information technology and information security systems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with such transition services viatris and pfizer agreed among other things that each of them will each bear 50 of the first 380 million of certain reasonable outofpocket costs incurred by pfizer in connection with the services with viatris bearing all of such costs in excess of 380 million 

in addition in connection with the combination viatris agreed to indemnify pfizer for certain liabilities any payments pursuant to these indemnities could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends or stock price see “ we are involved in various legal proceedings and certain government inquiries and may experience unfavorable outcomes of such proceedings or inquiries ” below 

viatris may be subject to significant us tax liabilities or be obligated to indemnify pfizer for any such tax liability imposed on pfizer and is subject to potentially significant restrictions that could limit its ability to undertake certain corporate actions such as stock issuances or the undertaking of a merger or consolidation 

in connection with the combination pfizer received the irs ruling and the tax opinion each to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the distribution together with certain related transactions will qualify as a taxfree “reorganization” within the meaning of section 368a1d of the code the distribution will qualify as a taxfree distribution 

within the meaning of section 355 of the code and the pfizer distribution payments will qualify as money distributed to pfizer creditors or stockholders in connection with the reorganization for purposes of section 361b of the code 

although the irs ruling is generally binding on the irs the continuing validity of the irs ruling is subject to the accuracy of the factual representations made in the ruling request an opinion of tax counsel neither binds the irs nor precludes the irs or the courts from adopting a contrary position accordingly notwithstanding the irs ruling and tax opinion there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert a position contrary to one or more of the conclusions set forth herein and if the irs prevails in such challenge the us federal income tax consequences of the distribution together with certain related transactions to pfizer viatris and the holders of pfizer common stock could be materially different from and worse than the us federal income tax consequences described below 

if the distribution were determined not to have qualified for taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code pfizer would generally be subject to tax as if it sold the viatris common stock in a transaction taxable to pfizer which could result in a material tax liability that under certain circumstances viatris may be required to indemnify pfizer against pursuant to the tax matters agreement 

even if the distribution were otherwise to qualify as a taxfree transaction under sections 368a1d and 355 of the code the distribution would be taxable to pfizer but not to pfizer’s stockholders pursuant to section 355e of the internal revenue code if there were a 50 percent or greater change in ownership of either pfizer or viatris directly or indirectly as part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the distribution for this purpose any acquisitions of pfizer or viatris common stock within the period beginning two years before the distribution and ending two years after the distribution are presumed to be part of such a plan although pfizer may be able to rebut that presumption for purposes of this test the combination will be treated as part of a plan but the combination standing alone will not cause the distribution to be taxable to pfizer under section 355e of the code because holders immediately before the distribution of pfizer common stock directly owned more than 50 percent of viatris common stock immediately following the combination nevertheless if the irs were to determine that other acquisitions of pfizer common stock or viatris common stock either before or after the distribution were part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the distribution such determination could result in the recognition of a material amount of taxable gain for us federal income tax purposes by pfizer under section 355e of the code under the tax matters agreement viatris will be required to indemnify pfizer against any taxes resulting from the distribution or certain aspects of the separation that arise as a result of viatris’ breach of certain representations or covenants in the tax matters agreement or certain other acts or omissions by viatris including certain actions that could result in section 355e of the code applying to the distribution if viatris was required to indemnify pfizer for taxes resulting from the distribution or certain aspects of the separation that indemnification obligation could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on viatris including with respect to our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the tax matters agreement generally prohibits viatris and its affiliates from taking certain actions that could cause the distribution and certain related transactions to fail to qualify as taxfree transactions to pfizer and its stockholders furthermore unless an exception applies for a twoyear period following the date of the distribution viatris and its subsidiaries may not 

• engage in transactions in which viatris’ stock is acquired 

• engage in certain mergers or consolidations 

• discontinue the active conduct of the upjohn business 

• sell certain assets 

• redeem or repurchase any of viatris’ stock other than share repurchases permitted by the irs ruling or 

• amend the viatris charter or take any other action affecting the relative voting rights of any of its stock or stock rights 

if viatris intends to take certain restricted actions it must notify pfizer of the proposal to take such action and either a obtain a ruling from the irs or an unqualified opinion acceptable to pfizer to the effect that such action will not affect the taxfree status of the distribution and certain related transactions or b receive from pfizer a waiver of such requirement however none of the receipt of an irs ruling an unqualified tax opinion or a waiver by pfizer will relieve viatris of any responsibility to indemnify pfizer for taxrelated losses resulting from such actions as a result of these restrictions and indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement viatris may be limited in its ability to pursue strategic transactions equity or convertible debt financings or other transactions that may otherwise be in our best interests 

strategic risks 

our strategic initiatives including our strategic alliances may not achieve all intended benefits 

in addition to the integration and restructuring activities discussed above we have entered into and continue to consider and evaluate various strategic transactions and business arrangements on an ongoing basis including acquisitions asset purchases partnerships collaborations joint ventures divestitures product rationalization and investments these transactions and arrangements may be material both from a strategic and financial perspective there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully realize the expected benefits of any such transactions or arrangements furthermore although our expectation is to engage in divestitures and product rationalizations only if they advance or otherwise support our overall strategy any such sale could reduce the size or scope of our business our market share in particular markets or our opportunities with respect to certain markets or products 

we have also entered into strategic alliances with partners to develop manufacture market andor distribute certain products andor certain components of our products in various markets we commit substantial effort funds and other resources to these various collaborations including with respect to the development of biosimilar products there is a risk that the investments made by us in these collaborative arrangements will not generate financial returns while we believe our relationships with our partners generally are successful disputes or conflicting priorities and regulatory or legal intervention could be a source of delay or uncertainty as to the expected benefits of the collaboration in addition we enter into agreements with our collaboration partners that provide for certain services as well as cross manufacturing development and licensing arrangements in addition our global healthcare gateway may not achieve all of its expected benefits 

the overall execution of a strategic initiative may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer relationships and diversion of management’s andor employee’s attention among other potential adverse consequences in addition we may have to terminate a strategic alliance or our collaboration partners may be unable to fulfill their collaboration obligations 

any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we have and may continue to experience pressure on the pricing of and reimbursements for certain of our products due to pricing controls social or government pressure to lower the cost of drugs and consolidation across the supply chain 

we operate in a challenging environment with significant pressures on the pricing of our products and on our ability to obtain and maintain satisfactory rates of reimbursement for our products by governments insurers and other payors the growth of overall healthcare costs has led governments and payors to implement new measures to control healthcare spending as a result we face numerous costcontainment measures by governments and other payors including certain governmentimposed industrywide price reductions mandatory rebates or pricing international reference pricing ie the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries volumebased procurement tender systems shifting of the payment burden to patients through higher copayments and requirements for increased transparency on pricing this international patchwork of price regulation and differing economic conditions and incomplete value assessments across countries has led to varying access to quality medicine in many markets and some third party trade in our products between countries and may have an adverse impact on the pricing of our products 

many markets in which we operate have implemented or may implement tender systems for generic pharmaceuticals in an effort to lower prices under such tender systems manufacturers submit bids which establish prices for generic pharmaceutical products upon winning the tender the winning company will receive a preferential reimbursement for a period of time if our bids do not win we may not be able to participate in the given market or may lose out on market share in addition if customers to whom we supply api do not win their tender bids the amount of api that we sell to them may be reduced the tender system often results in companies underbidding one another by proposing low pricing in order to win the tender other markets may also consider the implementation of a tender system or have implemented or plan to implement government mandated price reductions andor other forms of price controls even if a tender system or other price controls are ultimately not implemented the anticipation of such could result in price reductions 

in china pricing pressures have increased in recent years and the chinese government has also increased its focus on patient access and reimbursement for pharmaceutical medicines for example in 2013 china began to implement a qce process for postloe products to improve the quality of domestically manufactured generic drugs primarily by requiring such drugs to pass a test to assess their bioequivalence to a qualified reference drug typically the originator drug in addition vbp policy for post loe products is now in its third year and includes more than 150 molecules while all major viatris brands are already included in the vbp molecule list historically we have had limited success in the bidding process and most contracts went to local chinese generic companies in addition the bidding process has resulted in significant price cuts for the molecules included with some bidders reducing the price of their products by as much as 96 as they attempt to secure volumes on the chinese pharmaceutical market we expect pricing pressures on our products included in the vbp program to continue to increase as a result of these programs and viatris may be unable to successfully win contracts through these centralized procurement projects in the future we have failed and may continue to fail to win bids due to various factors including 

uncompetitive bidding prices in addition the urp policy will cap reimbursement of molecules at their vbp tender winning price urp will create additional pricing and volume pressure for pharmaceutical products that are subject to the program and is expected to negatively impact our results of operations 

demand for our products also depends in part on the extent to which reimbursements are available in the us thirdparty payors increasingly challenge the pricing of pharmaceutical products these trends and other trends toward managed healthcare the vertical consolidation among insurers pbms and pharmacies and legislative healthcare reform create significant uncertainties regarding the future levels of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products further any reimbursement may be reduced in the future to the point that market demand for our products andor our profitability declines changes to medicare andor state medicaid programs or changes required in the way in which medicare payment rates are set the design of the medicare part d benefit andor the way medicaid rebates are calculated could adversely affect the payment we receive for our products in order to control expenditures on pharmaceuticals most member states in the eu regulate the pricing of products and in some cases limit the range of different forms of pharmaceuticals available for prescription by national health services these controls can result in considerable price differences between member states 

there has also been increasing us federal and state legislative and enforcement interest with respect to drug pricing as well as from international organizations like the united nations world health organization and organization for economic cooperation and development in addition to intense publicity and scrutiny regarding such matters including publicity and pressure resulting from prices charged by competitors and peer companies for new products as well as price increases by competitors and peer companies on older products that some have deemed excessive in particular us federal prosecutors have issued subpoenas to pharmaceutical companies including mylan seeking information about their drug pricing practices among other issues the us congress has also conducted hearings with respect to drug pricing and members of congress have sought information from certain pharmaceutical companies including mylan relating to drugprice increases 

in addition there have been legislation and legislative and regulatory proposals concerning drug prices and related issues including the perceived need to bring more transparency to drug pricing reviewing the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reforming government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs in the us in addition to new state transparency laws and the introduction of several federal pricing bills several executive orders were signed and rules were issued in 2020 relating to drug pricing some of which have been delayed andor are the subject of litigation these new orders and rules related to medicare part d rebate reform providing discounted insulin andor epipen® autoinjector to patients in federally qualified health centers drug importation from canada and most favored nation pricing for medicare although we expect to see continued focus in regulating pricing we cannot predict what if any additional legislative or regulatory developments may transpire at the state or country level particularly given a new administration and changes in control of congress or what the ultimate impact may be 

in the us certain of these pressures are further compounded by increasing consolidation among wholesalers retailer drug chains pbms private insurers managed care organizations and other private payors which can increase their negotiating power particularly with respect to our generic drugs please also refer to “ a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales to a limited number of customers” 

the international patchwork of price regulation failing to win tenders the implementation of price control systems adverse legislation and regulation the consolidation of our customers or continued social or government pressure to lower the cost of pharmaceutical products could have a material adverse impact on our business reputation financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

healthcare reform legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in recent years there have been numerous initiatives on the federal and state levels for comprehensive reforms affecting the payment for the availability of and reimbursement for healthcare services in the us and it is likely that congress and state legislatures and health agencies will continue to focus on healthcare reform in the future while the aca increased the number of patients who have insurance coverage for our products it also included provisions such as the assessment of a pharmaceutical manufacturer fee and an increase in the amount of rebates that manufacturers pay for coverage of their drugs by medicaid programs the aca may be subject to revisions and modifications in the future further congress continues to consider drug pricing legislation that if passed and signed into law could impact companies’ ability to increase prices for products beyond the rate of inflation 

we are unable to predict the future course of federal or state healthcare legislation or reform including temporary or permanent healthcare reform measures resulting from the covid19 pandemic or the outcome of challenges to such laws or reforms once passed the aca and further changes in the law or regulatory framework that reduce our revenues or increase our 

costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

additionally we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in the eu and some other international markets the government provides healthcare at low cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility andor reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system these systems of price regulations may lead to inconsistent and lower prices within the eu and in other countries the availability of our products in some markets at lower prices undermines our sales in other markets with higher prices additionally certain countries set prices by reference to the prices in other countries where our products are marketed thus our inability to secure adequate prices in a particular country may also impair our ability to obtain acceptable prices in existing and potential new markets and may create the opportunity for third party crossborder trade 

significant additional reforms to the us or eu healthcare systems or to the healthcare systems of other markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we have significant operations globally which exposes us to the risks inherent in conducting our business internationally 

our operations extend to numerous countries globally and therefore are subject to the risks inherent in this geographic scope these risks include but are not limited to 

• the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

• compliance with the national and local laws regulations and customs of countries in which we do business including but not limited to data privacy and protection importexport and enforcement of intellectual property protections 

• less established legal and regulatory regimes in certain jurisdictions including china where the interpretation and enforcement of laws rules and regulations may involve uncertainties and can be inconsistent 

• that litigation administrative and court proceedings may be protracted expensive and unpredictable 

• that governments in certain jurisdictions may favor local businesses and make it more difficult for foreign businesses to operate on an equal footing 

• increased uncertainties related to the enforcement of contracts with certain parties 

• compliance with a variety of us laws including but not limited to regulations put forth by the us treasury’s office of foreign assets control the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 and rules relating to the use of certain “conflict minerals” under section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and the consumer protection act 

• changes in laws regulations and practices affecting the pharmaceutical industry and the healthcare system including but not limited to imports exports manufacturing quality cost pricing reimbursement approval inspection and delivery of healthcare 

• changes in policies designed to promote foreign investment including significant tax incentives liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation 

• increased us congressional and executive branch scrutiny of overseas pharmaceutical manufacturing including executive orders and policy proposals related to increasing us production of pharmaceutical products and api 

• differing local product preferences and product requirements 

• adverse changes in the economies in which we or our partners and suppliers operate as a result of a slowdown in overall growth a change in government or economic policies or financial political or social change or instability in such countries that affects the markets in which we operate particularly emerging markets 

• changes in employment or labor laws wage increases or rising inflation in the countries in which we or our partners and suppliers operate 

• local regional and global restrictions on banking and commercial activities in certain markets especially emerging markets 

• longer payment cycles and increased exposure to counterparty risk 

• volatility in international financial markets and increased foreign currency risk 

• risks and uncertainties related to the formal withdrawal of the uk from the eu commonly referred to as brexit and the subsequent entry into a trade agreement that governs the uk’s relationship with the eu including with respect to divergent national laws and regulations importexport restrictions delays in regulatory approvals and changes in pharmaceutical regulations governing marketing authorizations in the eu and the uk which could materially impact the way we conduct our operations in those markets 

• supply disruptions and increases in energy and transportation costs 

• increased tariffs on the import or export of our products or api including on imports from china to the us as a result of the escalation of trade tensions between the countries or otherwise 

• burdens to comply with multiple changing and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations including those relating to the environment carbon emissions health and safety labor and human rights 

• natural or manmade disasters including droughts floods earthquakes hurricanes and the impact of climate change in the countries in which we or our partners and suppliers operate and 

• local disturbances the outbreak of highly contagious diseases or other health epidemics such as covid19 terrorist attacks riots social disruption wars or regional hostilities in the countries in which we or our partners and suppliers operate and that could affect the economy our operations and employees by disrupting operations and communications making travel and the conduct of our business more difficult andor causing our customers to be concerned about our ability to meet their needs 

we also face the risk that some of our competitors have more experience with operations in such countries or with international operations generally and may be able to manage unexpected crises more easily moreover the internal political stability of or the relationship between any country or countries where we conduct business operations may deteriorate changes in a country’s political stability or the state of relations between any such countries are difficult to predict and the political or social stability in andor diplomatic relations between any countries in which we or our partners and suppliers do business could meaningfully deteriorate 

the occurrence of any one or more of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

charges to earnings resulting from acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price  

under us gaap provisions relating to business acquisition accounting standards we recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in acquired companies generally at their acquisition date fair values and in each case separately from goodwill goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess amount of consideration transferred which is also generally measured at fair value and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain after we complete an acquisition the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results and may adversely affect our cash flows 

• costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention redeployment or relocation expenses 

• liabilities assumed in purchase accounting 

• impairment of goodwill or intangible assets including acquired iprd 

• amortization of intangible assets acquired 

• a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired 

• identification of or changes to assumed contingent liabilities including but not limited to litigation reserves contingent purchase price consideration including fair value adjustments income tax contingencies and other nonincome tax contingencies after our final determination of the amounts for these contingencies or the conclusion of the measurement period generally up to one year from the acquisition date whichever comes first 

• charges to our operating results to eliminate certain duplicative preacquisition activities including exiting tsas with pfizer 

• significant costs to restructure our operations and to reduce our cost structure including cost related to severance payments plant shutdowns and costs to achieve anticipated synergies and 

• charges to our operating results resulting from expenses incurred to effect the acquisition 

a significant portion of these adjustments could be accounted for as expenses that will decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those costs are incurred 

in particular the amount of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in our consolidated balance sheets is significant as a result of our acquisitions and other transactions and may increase further following future potential acquisitions and we may from time to time sell assets that we determine are not critical to our strategy or execution future events or decisions may also lead to asset impairments andor related charges certain noncash impairments may result from a change in our strategic goals business direction or other factors relating to the overall business environment any such charges could cause a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we applied purchase accounting to the combination and determined that mylan was the accounting acquirer in the combination for purposes of applying purchase accounting to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of the upjohn business in connection with the combination 

the illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of our products or of diverted or stolen products could have a negative impact on our reputation and our business 

the pharmaceutical drug supply has been increasingly challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the internet 

third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products that do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective and can be potentially lifethreatening counterfeit medicines may contain harmful substances the wrong dose of api or no api at all however to distributors and users counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version 

reports of adverse reactions to counterfeit drugs or increased levels of counterfeiting could materially affect patient confidence in the authentic product it is possible that adverse events caused by unsafe counterfeit products will mistakenly be attributed to the authentic product in addition unauthorized diversions of products or thefts of inventory at warehouses plants or while intransit could result in improper storage or compromise product integrity and therefore adversely impact patient safety our reputation and our business 

loss of sales or revenues as well as public loss of confidence in the integrity of pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting diversion or theft could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we face vigorous competition that threatens the commercial acceptance and pricing of our products  

the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive we face competition from other pharmaceutical manufacturers globally some of whom are significantly larger than we are and have stronger more wellestablished reputations than us our competitors may be able to develop products and processes competitive with or superior to our own for many reasons including but not limited to the possibility that they may have 

• proprietary processes or delivery systems 

• larger or more productive rd and marketing staff 

• larger or more efficient production capabilities in a particular therapeutic area 

• more experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials 

• more products 

• more experience in developing new drugs or 

• greater financial resources 

we also face increasing competition from lowercost generic products and other branded products certain of our products are not protected by patent rights or have limited patent life and will soon lose patent protection loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly with the launch of generic products as a result sales of many of these products may decline or stop growing over time and may decline faster than has been projected for example the compound patent for celebrex in japan expired in november 2019 and generics entered the market in june 2020 in june 2019 lyrica’s pediatric exclusivity in the united states expired and multisource generic competition commenced in the united states in july 2019 additionally over the next several years some products may lose market exclusivity upon entry of generic products prior to patent exclusivity for example several companies launched a generic to lyrica in japan in december 2020 despite pending patent infringement litigation the litigation remains ongoing and the patents expire in july 2022 we may not be successful in managing competition from nonbranded generics or other alternatives or in generally managing revenues after loss of exclusivity and our business may be materially adversely affected 

generic competitors are also becoming more aggressive in terms of pricing in many of the regions in which viatris operates in china for example we face strong competition from certain generic manufacturers which may result in price cuts and volume loss on some of viatris’ branded products we also face competition in the united states the eu and other mature markets that have a robust generics market and favorable regulatory conditions for generics in addition legislative proposals emerge from time to time in various jurisdictions to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs any such proposal that is enacted into law could increase competition and worsen this negative effect on our branded sales 

in addition certain of our products also face potential competition from products that may be developed in the future that could render our products uncompetitive or obsolete for example companies may develop medicines that treat the same indications targeted by our products and these medicines could be more effective than our products or patients and physicians could prefer these medicines over our medicines the introduction of these new competing products could also have a negative impact on product sales 

other related factors that could affect our business include 

• competitors’ products may also be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower prices or better performance features than ours 

• pbms and other pharmaceutical manufacturers may utilize contracting strategies that could decrease generic utilization of or otherwise negatively impact our products 

• vertical integration of pharmacies and large purchasing organizations or consolidation among distribution outlets and 

• our sales may suffer as a result of changes in consumer demand for our products including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality willingness of customers to switch among products of different pharmaceutical manufacturers importation by consumers or the introduction of new products by competitors 

the occurrence of any of the above risks could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

a relatively small group of products may represent a significant portion of our revenues net sales gross profit or net earnings from time to time 

sales of a limited number of our products from time to time represent a significant portion of our revenues net sales gross profit and net earnings for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 viatris’ top ten products in terms of sales in the aggregate represented approximately 23 and 23 respectively of the company’s net sales in the future we expect that the mix of our top products will change and the concentration of sales for those top products will increase as a result of the combination if the volume or pricing of our largest selling products declines in the future our business financial condition results of operations cash flows andor share price could be materially adversely affected 

operational risks 

public health outbreaks epidemics and pandemics including the covid19 pandemic have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows andor stock price and may impact our ability to pay dividends 

public health outbreaks epidemics and pandemics including the covid19 pandemic have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business we continue to closely monitor the impact of the covid19 pandemic on all aspects of our business including its impact on our workforce suppliers vendors business partners distribution channels customers and patients as the rate of infection remains high in many countries including the us attempts continue to be made to reduce the spread of covid19 including quarantines vaccination programs government restrictions on movement business closures and suspensions canceled events and activities selfisolation and other voluntary andor mandated changes in behavior both the outbreak of the disease and actions to slow its spread have created significant uncertainty economic volatility and disruption and increased unemployment which have impacted and may continue to impact our business operations and have materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our workforce and business operations as well as our financial condition results of operations cash flows andor stock price and may impact our ability to pay dividends 

while our business operations are currently considered essential based on current government guidelines throughout the world due to the important role pharmaceutical manufacturers play within the global healthcare system many of our administrative offices have been operating under work from home protocols which are expected to continue at least through mid2021 in addition certain programs or incentives implemented to ensure employee health and safety such as subsidized testing hazard pay sick leave and bonus payments have increased our operating costs extended changes in work conditions including work from home protocols could strain our business continuity plans reduce productivity and morale or introduce operational risk including but not limited to increased cybersecurity risk for example remote working environments may be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks including phishing and social engineering attempts and malware attacks that seek to exploit the covid19 pandemic 

additionally we have taken extra precautions at our manufacturing facilities to aid in the protection of onsite personnel and operations including the implementation of social distancing guidelines daily health assessments of onsite 

personnel and split shifts where feasible if we experience an increase in reported illnesses or quarantining at any of our facilities including critical manufacturing sites it is possible that such facilities may need to close for an extended period of time which could negatively affect our ability to produce ship and supply products to our customers and would impact our business and financial results 

in addition customerfacing field operations have moved to a remote engagement model and global restrictions have been placed on travel and inperson meetings a remote engagement model may not be as successful as inperson meetings and could result in lower sales of products particularly new products we have also taken steps to protect the safety of study participants employees and staff at clinical trial sites while continuing to ensure regulatory compliance and scientific integrity of trial data 

covid19 and related responsive measures have also made and may continue to make it difficult for us our partners or suppliers to source and manufacture products in and to export our products from certain affected areas in addition we have faced and may continue to face delays or difficulty sourcing certain products or raw materials including apis even if we are able to find alternate sources for such products or raw materials they may cost more in addition we have experienced and may continue to experience increased shipping and freight costs as well as delays in shipping these factors have materially adversely affected and could continue to materially adversely affect our ability to produce ship and supply products which could negatively impact our customer relationships business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price or result in negative publicity and reputational harm 

lower retail pharmacy demand as well as some patients doctors and hospitals delaying or foregoing routine doctor and hospital visits and elective medical procedures has led and could continue to lead to decreased demand for certain of our products which has negatively impacted our sales results of operations and financial results at the same time we have experienced and could continue to experience unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products which could exceed our capacity to meet such demand and negatively impact our customer relationships business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

health regulatory agencies globally may also experience disruptions in their operations and greater regulatory uncertainty as a result of the covid19 pandemic for instance the fda has announced its intention to temporarily postpone certain inspections of domestic and foreign manufacturing facilities the fda and comparable foreign regulatory agencies may have slower response times or reduced resources and as a result review of regulatory submissions inspections approval of new products and other timelines important to our business may be materially impacted which could delay our new product launches and have a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition our continued access to external sources of liquidity depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings also the continuing impact of the covid19 pandemic could lead to our customers or suppliers having liquidity problems that could negatively impact our ability to collect cash on our receivables andor negatively impact our ability to get inventory and materials if the impacts of the pandemic create further disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets or customer or supplier liquidity issues or if rating agencies lower our credit ratings it could adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial position 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will continue to impact us depends on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not currently able to predict and may also exacerbate other risks discussed in these risk factors any of which could have a material adverse effect on us our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

current and changing economic conditions may adversely affect our industry business partners and suppliers 

the global economy continues to experience significant volatility and the economic environment may become less favorable economic volatility governmental financial restructuring efforts and evolving deficit and spending reduction programs could negatively impact the global economy and the pharmaceutical industry this has led or could lead to reduced consumer and customer spending reduced or eliminated governmental or thirdparty payor coverage or reimbursement or reduced spending on healthcare including but not limited to pharmaceutical products while generic drugs present an alternative to higherpriced branded products our sales could be negatively impacted if patients forego obtaining healthcare patients and customers reduce spending or purchases or if governments or thirdparty payors reduce or eliminate coverage or reimbursement amounts for pharmaceuticals or impose price or other controls adversely impacting the price or availability of pharmaceuticals whether for generics branded products or both in addition reduced consumer and customer spending reduced government or thirdparty payor coverage or reimbursement or new government controls may drive us and our competitors to decrease prices may reduce the ability of customers to pay or may result in reduced demand for our products 

the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our industry business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

failure to comply with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations worldwide could adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we are subject globally to various laws and regulations concerning among other things the environment climate change water chemicals and employee safety these requirements include regulation of the handling manufacture transportation storage use and disposal of materials and wastes including the discharge of regulated materials and emissions into the environment we are also subject to related permitting recordkeeping reporting and registration requirements in the normal course of our business we are exposed to risks relating to possible releases of hazardous substances into the environment which could cause environmental or property damage or personal injuries and which could result in i our noncompliance with such environmental and occupational health and safety laws regulations and permits and ii regulatory enforcement actions or claims for personal injury and property damage against us if environmental discharge occurs or if we discover contamination caused by prior operations including by prior owners and operators of properties we acquire or lease we could be liable for cleanup or remediation obligations damages and fines or have relevant permits authorizations or registrations modified or revoked in addition any noncompliance with environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations and permits or emissions into the environment whether actual or perceived may result in significant reputational damage the substantial unexpected costs we may incur could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations are also complex and subject to change and our related capital expenditures and costs for compliance may increase substantially in the future as a result of such changes the development and manufacturing of a new product or increased development or manufacturing activities at any of our facilities we may be required to expend significant funds and our manufacturing activities could be delayed or suspended or we may lose the ability to purchase or use certain materials or face restrictions on the amounts of materials we may use or purchase which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

the pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated and we face significant costs and uncertainties associated with our efforts to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

the pharmaceutical industry is subject to regulation by various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate including the us eu china and india for instance we must comply with applicable laws and requirements of the fda and other regulatory agencies including foreign authorities with respect to the research development manufacture quality safety effectiveness approval labeling tracking tracing authentication storage recordkeeping reporting pharmacovigilance sale distribution import export marketing advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products we are committed to conducting our business including the sale and marketing of our products in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations these laws and regulations however are numerous and complex and it is possible that a governmental authority may challenge our activities or that an employee or agent could violate these laws and regulations without our knowledge failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in a range of consequences including but not limited to fines penalties disgorgement exclusion from us federal healthcare reimbursement programs unanticipated compliance expenditures suspension of review of applications or other submissions rejection or delay in approval of applications recall or seizure of products total or partial suspension of production andor distribution our inability to sell products the return by customers of our products injunctions andor criminal prosecution under certain circumstances a regulator may also have the authority to revoke or vary previously granted drug approvals 

the safety profile of any product will continue to be closely monitored by the fda and comparable foreign regulatory authorities after approval if such regulatory authorities become aware of new safety information about any of our marketed or investigational products those authorities may require further inspections enhancements to manufacturing controls labeling changes establishment of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or similar strategy restrictions on a product’s indicated uses or marketing or postapproval studies or postmarket surveillance in addition we are subject to regulations in various jurisdictions including the federal drug supply chain security act in the us the falsified medicines directive in the eu and several other such regulations in other countries that require us to develop electronic systems to serialize track trace and authenticate units of our products through the supply chain and distribution system compliance with these regulations has in the past and may in the future result in increased expenses for us or impose greater administrative burdens on our organization and failure to meet these requirements could result in fines or other penalties 

in recent years the regulatory framework in china regarding the pharmaceutical industry has undergone significant changes and chinese authorities have become increasingly vigilant in enforcing laws in the pharmaceutical industry we believe that viatris’ strategies regarding pharmaceutical research development manufacturing and commercialization in china 

are currently aligned with the chinese government’s policies but they may in the future diverge requiring a change in such strategies any such change may result in increased compliance costs to us or cause delays in or prevent the successful research development manufacturing or commercialization of our products in china result in the loss of required licenses and permits or the suspension or termination of viatris’ activities in china 

the fda and comparable foreign regulatory authorities also regulate the facilities and operational procedures that we use to manufacture our products we must register our facilities with the fda and similar regulators in other countries products must be manufactured in our facilities in accordance with cgmp or similar standards in each territory in which we manufacture compliance with such regulations and with our own quality standards requires substantial expenditures of time money and effort in multiple areas including training of personnel recordkeeping production and quality control and quality assurance the fda and other comparable regulatory authorities including foreign authorities periodically inspect our manufacturing facilities for compliance with cgmp or similar standards in the applicable territory regulatory approval to manufacture a drug is granted on a sitespecific basis failure to comply with cgmp and other regulatory standards at one of our or our partners’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facilities could result in an adverse action brought by the fda or other regulatory authorities which could result in the receipt of an untitled or warning letter fines penalties disgorgement unanticipated compliance expenditures rejection or delay in approval of applications suspension of review of applications or other submissions suspension of ongoing clinical trials recall or seizure of products total or partial suspension of production andor distribution our inability to sell products the return by customers of our products orders to suspend vary or withdraw marketing authorizations injunctions consent decrees requirements to modify promotional materials or issue corrective information to healthcare practitioners refusal to permit import or export criminal prosecution andor other adverse actions 

our business could be adversely affected if any regulatory body were to delay withhold or withdraw approval of an application require a recall or other adverse product action require one of our manufacturing facilities to cease or limit production or suspend vary or withdraw related marketing authorization delay and cost in obtaining fda or other regulatory approval to manufacture at a different facility also could have a material adverse effect on our business 

although we have established internal quality and regulatory compliance programs and policies there is no guarantee that these programs and policies as currently designed will meet regulatory agency standards in the future or will prevent instances of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations additionally despite our compliance efforts from time to time we or our partners receive notices of manufacturing and qualityrelated observations following inspections by regulatory authorities around the world as well as official agency correspondence regarding compliance for example the fda has issued warning letters relating to valsartan api and nitrosamine impurities to our api manufacturers mylan laboratories limited unit 8 and mylan laboratories limited unit 7 we have provided thorough responses to the fda regarding the issues identified and remediation is ongoing in addition in november 2018 the fda issued a warning letter with respect to our manufacturing plant in morgantown west virginia we implemented comprehensive restructuring and remediation activities at our morgantown plant and on may 11 2020 we received a closeout letter from the fda however we or our partners may receive similar observations and correspondence in the future if we are unable to resolve these observations and address regulatory concerns in a timely fashion our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price could be materially affected 

we utilize controlled substances in certain of our current products and products in development and therefore must meet the requirements of the controlled substances act of 1970 and the related regulations administered by the dea in the us as well as those of similar laws in other countries where we operate these laws relate to the manufacture shipment storage sale and use of controlled substances the dea and other regulatory agencies limit the availability of the controlled substances used in certain of our current products and products in development and as a result our procurement quota of these active ingredients may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials we must annually apply to the dea and similar regulatory agencies for procurement quotas in order to obtain these substances any delay or refusal by the dea or such similar agencies in establishing our procurement quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches or could cause trade inventory disruptions for those products that have already been launched in addition some states have passed laws and regulations imposing assessments on the sale or distribution of certain controlled substances and other states are considering and may implement similar laws and regulations in the future 

the occurrence of any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

the use of legal regulatory and legislative strategies by both brand and generic competitors including but not limited to “authorized generics” and regulatory petitions may increase costs associated with the introduction or marketing of our generic products could delay or prevent such introduction and could significantly reduce our revenue and profit  

our competitors both branded and generic often pursue strategies to prevent or delay generic alternatives to branded products these strategies include but are not limited to 

• entering into agreements whereby other generic companies will begin to market an authorized generic which is the approved brandname drug without the brandname on its label at the same time or after generic competition initially enters the market 

• launching their own authorized generic product prior to or at the same time or after generic competition initially enters the market 

• pricing a branded product at a discount equivalent to generic pricing as was the case for copaxone after the launch of mylan’s generic glatiramer acetate products 

• filing frivolous petitions with the fda or other regulatory bodies seeking to prevent or delay approvals including timing the filings so as to thwart generic competition by causing delays of our product approvals 

• contracting strategies among pharmaceutical manufacturers and pbms that could decrease generic or biosimilar utilization and negatively impact our product launches 

• seeking to establish regulatory and legal obstacles that would make it more difficult to demonstrate bioequivalence or to meet other requirements for approval andor to prevent regulatory agency review of applications 

• initiating legislative or other efforts to limit the substitution of generic versions of brand pharmaceuticals 

• filing suits for patent infringement and other claims that may delay or prevent regulatory approval manufacture andor sale of generic products 

• introducing “nextgeneration” products prior to the expiration of market exclusivity for the reference product which often materially reduces the demand for the generic or the reference product for which we seek regulatory approval 

• persuading regulatory bodies to withdraw the approval of brandname drugs for which the patents are about to expire and converting the market to another product of the brand company on which longer patent protection exists 

• obtaining extensions of market exclusivity by conducting clinical trials of brand drugs in pediatric populations or by other methods and 

• seeking to obtain new patents on drugs for which patent protection is about to expire 

in the us some companies have lobbied congress for amendments to hatchwaxman act that would give them additional advantages over generic competitors for example although the term of a company’s drug patent can be extended to reflect a portion of the time an nda which is filed in the us with the fda when approval is sought to market a newly developed branded product and in certain instances for a new dosage form a new delivery system or a new indication for a previously approved drug is under regulatory review some companies have proposed extending the patent term by a full year for each year spent in clinical trials rather than the onehalf year that is currently permitted 

if proposals like these in the us eu or in other countries where we or our partners and suppliers operate were to become effective or if any other actions by our competitors and other third parties to prevent or delay activities necessary to the approval manufacture or distribution of our products are successful our entry into the market and our ability to generate revenues associated with new products may be delayed reduced or eliminated which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

if we are unable to successfully introduce new products in a timely manner our future revenue and profitability may be adversely affected 

our future revenues and profitability will depend in part upon our ability to successfully and timely develop license or otherwise acquire and commercialize new products product development is inherently risky especially for new drugs for which safety and efficacy have not been established andor the market is not yet proven as well as for complex generic drugs and biosimilars likewise product licensing involves inherent risks including among others uncertainties due to matters that may affect the achievement of milestones as well as the possibility of contractual disagreements with regard to whether the supply of product meets certain specifications or terms such as license scope or termination rights as viatris focuses more in complex products the development and commercialization process requires substantial time effort and financial resources we or a partner may not be successful in commercializing such products on a timely basis or at all which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

before any prescription drug product including generic drug products can be marketed marketing authorization approval is required by the relevant regulatory authorities andor national regulatory agencies for example the fda in the us the ema in the eu and other regulatory authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approval to manufacture and market new branded and generic pharmaceutical products is rigorous time consuming costly and inherently unpredictable in addition these regulatory agencies may be delayed in reviewing and approving products as a result of lapsed or insufficient funding insufficient staffing travel or work restrictions including as a result of the covid19 pandemic or other factors beyond our control any delay in regulatory approval could impact the commercial or financial success of a product 

outside the us the approval process may be more or less rigorous depending on the country and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required in the us bioequivalence clinical or other studies conducted in one country may not be accepted in other countries the requirements for approval may differ among countries and the approval of a pharmaceutical product in one country does not necessarily mean that the product will be approved in another country we or a partner or supplier may be unable to obtain requisite approvals on a timely basis or at all for new products that we may develop license or otherwise acquire moreover if we obtain regulatory approval for a drug it may be limited for example with respect to the indicated uses and delivery methods for which the drug may be marketed or may include warnings precautions or contraindications in the labeling which could restrict our potential market for the drug a regulatory approval may also include postapproval study or risk management requirements that may substantially increase the resources required to market the drug also for products pending approval we may obtain raw materials or produce batches of inventory to be used in efficacy and bioequivalence testing as well as in anticipation of the product’s launch in the event that regulatory approval is denied or delayed we could be exposed to the risk of this inventory becoming obsolete 

the approval process for generic pharmaceutical products often results in the relevant regulatory agency granting final approval to a number of generic pharmaceutical products at the time a patent claim for a corresponding branded product or other market exclusivity expires this often forces us to face immediate competition when we introduce a generic product into the market additionally further generic approvals often continue to be granted for a given product subsequent to the initial launch of the generic product these circumstances generally result in significantly lower prices as well as reduced margins for generic products compared to branded products new generic market entrants generally cause continued price margin and sales erosion over the generic product life cycle 

in the us the hatchwaxman act provides for a period of 180 days of generic marketing exclusivity for a “first applicant” that is the first submitted anda which is filed in the us with the fda when approval is sought to market a generic equivalent of a drug product previously approved under an nda and listed in the fda publication entitled approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations popularly known as the “orange book” or for a new dosage strength for a drug previously approved under an anda containing a certification of invalidity noninfringement or unenforceability related to a patent listed with the anda’s reference drug product commonly referred to as a paragraph iv certification during this exclusivity period which under certain circumstances may be shared with other andas filed on the same day the fda cannot grant final approval to latersubmitted andas for the same generic equivalent if an anda is awarded 180day exclusivity the applicant generally enjoys higher market share net revenues and gross margin for that generic product however our ability to obtain 180 days of generic marketing exclusivity may be dependent upon our ability to obtain fda approval or tentative approval within an applicable time period of the fda’s acceptance of our anda if we are unable to obtain approval or tentative approval within that time period we may risk forfeiture of such marketing exclusivity by contrast if we are not a “first applicant” to challenge a listed patent for such a product we may lose significant advantages to a competitor with 180day exclusivity even if we obtain fda approval for our generic drug product the same would be true in situations where we are required to share our exclusivity period with other anda sponsors with paragraph iv certifications 

in the eu and other countries and regions there is no exclusivity period for the first generic product the commission or national regulatory agencies may grant marketing authorizations to any number of generics 

if we are unable to navigate our products through the approval process in a timely manner there could be an adverse effect on our product introduction plans business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we expend a significant amount of resources on rd efforts that may not lead to successful product introductions 

much of our development effort is focused on technically difficulttoformulate products andor products that require advanced manufacturing technology including our biosimilars program and respiratory platform we conduct rd primarily to enable us to gain approval for manufacture and market pharmaceuticals in accordance with applicable laws and regulations we also partner with third parties to develop products typically research expenses related to the development of innovative or complex compounds and the filing of marketing authorization applications for innovative and complex compounds such as ndas and biosimilar applications in the us are significantly greater than those expenses associated with the development of and filing of marketing authorization applications for most generic products such as andas in the us and abridged applications in europe as we and our partners continue to develop new andor complex products our research expenses will likely increase because of the inherent risk associated with rd efforts in our industry including the high cost and uncertainty of conducting clinical trials where required particularly with respect to new andor complex drugs our or a partner’s rd expenditures may not result in the successful introduction of new pharmaceutical products approved by the relevant regulatory bodies also after we submit a marketing authorization application for a new compound or generic product the relevant regulatory authority may change standards andor request that we conduct additional studies or evaluations and as a result we may incur approval delays as well as rd costs in excess of what we anticipated 

clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete and its outcome is inherently uncertain failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process we or our partners may experience delays in our ongoing or future clinical trials and we do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin or enroll subjects on time need to be redesigned or be completed on schedule if at all 

clinical trials may be delayed suspended or prematurely terminated for a variety of reasons if we experience delays in the completion of or the termination of any clinical trial of our product candidates the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed in addition any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues any of these occurrences may harm our business financial condition and prospects significantly in addition many of the factors that cause or lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates 

finally we cannot be certain that any investment made in developing products will be recovered even if we are successful in commercialization to the extent that we expend significant resources on rd efforts and are not able ultimately to introduce successful new andor complex products as a result of those efforts there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

even if our products in development receive regulatory approval such products may not achieve expected levels of market acceptance  

even if we are able to obtain regulatory approvals for our new products the success of those products is dependent upon market acceptance levels of market acceptance for our products could be impacted by several factors including but not limited to 

• the availability perceived advantages and relative safety and efficacy of alternative products from our competitors 

• the degree to which the approved labeling supports promotional initiatives for commercial success 

• the prices of our products relative to those of our competitors 

• the timing of our market entry 

• the effectiveness of our marketing sales and distribution strategy and operations and 

• other competitor actions including legal actions 

additionally studies of the proper utilization safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products are being conducted by the industry government agencies and others such studies which increasingly employ sophisticated methods and techniques can call into question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed as well as future products in some cases such studies have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuation or variation of product marketing authorizations or requirements for risk management programs such as a patient registry any of these events could adversely affect our profitability business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

the development approval process manufacture and commercialization of biosimilar products involve unique challenges and uncertainties and our failure to successfully introduce biosimilar products could have a negative impact on our business and future operating results 

we and our partners and suppliers are actively working to develop and commercialize biosimilar products although the bpcia established a framework for the review and approval of biosimilar products and the fda has begun to review and approve biosimilar product applications there continues to be significant uncertainty regarding the regulatory pathway in the us with the fda continuing to issue and revise guidance related to its interpretation and implementation of the bpcia there is also uncertainty regarding the pathway to obtain approval for biosimilar products in other countries as well as uncertainty regarding the commercial pathway to successfully market and sell such products 

moreover biosimilar products generally involve extensive patent clearances and often involve patent infringement litigation related to multiple patents which could delay or prevent the commercial launch of a biosimilar product for many years if we are unable to obtain fda or other nonus regulatory authority approval for our products we will be unable to market them in addition the development and manufacture of biosimilars pose unique challenges related to the supply of the materials needed to manufacture biosimilars access to and the supply of necessary biological materials may be limited and government regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials 

even if our biosimilar products are approved for marketing the products may not be commercially successful may require more time than expected to achieve market acceptance and may not generate profits in amounts that are sufficient to 

offset the amount invested to obtain such approvals market success of biosimilar products will depend on demonstrating to regulators patients physicians and payors such as insurance companies that such products are safe and effective yet offer a more competitive price or other benefit over existing therapies in addition manufacturers of biologic products may try to dissuade physicians from prescribing or accepting biosimilar products we may not be able to generate future sales of biosimilar products in certain jurisdictions and may not realize the anticipated benefits of our investments in the development manufacture and sale of such products if our development efforts do not result in the development and timely approval of biosimilar products or if such products once developed and approved are not commercially successful or upon the occurrence of any of the above risks our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price could be materially adversely affected 

our business is highly dependent upon market perceptions of us our products and brands and the safety and quality of our products and brands as well as the effectiveness of our sales and marketing activities and we may be adversely impacted by negative publicity or findings 

market perceptions of us are very important to our business especially market perceptions of our company products brands and the safety and quality of our products and brands if we our partners and suppliers or our products or brands suffer from negative publicity are subject to market withdrawal or recall or are proven to be or are claimed to be ineffective or harmful to consumers then this could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business in addition viatris believes that maintaining and enhancing certain of its brands is important and often provides certain competitive advantages 

viatris’ sales and marketing efforts are anchored by promoting its products to physicians pharmacists clinics and hospitals therefore viatris’ sales and marketing force whether inhouse sales representatives or thirdparty commercial partners must possess a relatively high level of technical knowledge uptodate understanding of industry trends and expertise in the relevant therapeutic areas and products as well as promotion and communication skills marketing advertising and promotions may be expensive and may not achieve their intended benefits if viatris is unable to effectively train its inhouse sales representatives and thirdparty commercial partners or monitor and evaluate their marketing performances our sales and marketing may be less successful than desired in addition fewer inperson sales and marketing efforts as a result of restrictions put in place in order to contain the covid19 pandemic or other similar limitations may result in less successful sales and marketing activities 

given our dependence on market perception and sales and marketing efforts negative publicity associated with product or brand quality patient illness or other adverse effects resulting from or perceived to be resulting from our products or brands or our partners’ and suppliers’ manufacturing facilities or an inability to increase or maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of our sales and marketing activities could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales to a limited number of customers 

a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales to a limited number of customers if we were to experience a significant reduction in or loss of business with one or more such customers or if one or more such customers were to experience difficulty in paying us on a timely basis our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price could be materially adversely affected 

in addition a significant amount of our sales are to a relatively small number of drug wholesalers and retail drug chains these customers represent an essential part of the distribution chain of generic pharmaceutical products drug wholesalers and retail drug chains have undergone and are continuing to undergo significant consolidation this consolidation has resulted in these groups gaining additional purchasing leverage and consequently increasing the product pricing pressures facing our business we expect this trend of increased pricing pressures to continue additionally the emergence of large buying groups representing independent retail pharmacies and the prevalence and influence of managed care organizations and similar institutions increases the negotiating power of these groups enabling them to attempt to extract price discounts rebates and other restrictive pricing terms on our products these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we have a limited number of manufacturing facilities and certain thirdparty suppliers produce a substantial portion of our api and products some of which require a highly exacting and complex manufacturing process 

a substantial portion of our capacity as well as our current production is attributable to a limited number of manufacturing facilities and certain thirdparty suppliers a significant disruption at any one of such facilities within our internal or thirdparty supply chain even on a shortterm basis whether due to the failure of a thirdparty supplier to fulfill the terms of their agreement with us labor disruption adverse quality or compliance observation other regulatory action infringement of brand or other thirdparty intellectual property rights natural disaster civil or political unrest export or import 

restrictions or other events could impair our ability to produce and ship products to the market on a timely basis and could among other consequences subject us to exposure to claims from customers any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price the adverse effects of any of these events could be exacerbated as a result of our previously announced global restructuring program which we expect will involve closing downsizing or divesting up to 15 manufacturing facilities globally if we or our thirdparty suppliers’ face significant manufacturing issues this could lead to shutdowns delays or product shortages or to our being entirely unable to supply certain products to customers for an extended period of time in addition our facilities may be required to close for periods of time be required to staff at reduced capacity or suffer other manufacturing delays as the result of an outbreak of disease epidemic or pandemic such as the covid19 pandemic in or near any of our facilities such shortages delays or shutdowns have led and could continue to lead to significant losses of sales revenue thirdparty litigation or negative publicity see also “ the pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated and we face significant costs and uncertainties associated with our efforts to comply with applicable laws and regulations” 

we purchase certain api and other materials and supplies that we use in our manufacturing operations as well as certain finished products from many different foreign and domestic suppliers the price of api and other materials and supplies is subject to volatility and in certain cases we have listed only one supplier in our applications with regulatory agencies there is no guarantee that we will always have timely sufficient or affordable access to critical raw materials or finished product supplied by third parties even when we have more than one supplier which could lead to our or our partners’ and suppliers’ inability to supply sufficient quantities of our products to meet market demand in addition quality deficiencies in the products which we or our suppliers provide or at our or their manufacturing facilities have in the past and could in the future adversely impact our manufacturing and supply capabilities cause supply interruptions or lead to voluntary market withdrawals or product recalls for example the eu has implemented particularly stringent regulations with respect to manufacturing standards for api imported into europe that place the certification requirement on the regulatory bodies of the exporting countries an increase in the price or an interruption in the supply of a singlesourced or any other raw material including the relevant api or in the supply of finished product could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

in connection with the combination viatris entered into certain manufacturing and supply agreements with pfizer reliance on pfizer under those agreements entails risks related to regulatory and quality assurance including cgmp compliance unforeseen disruption of the manufacture or supply or our products the possible breach of the agreement by pfizer the possible misappropriation of our proprietary information or the possible termination of the agreements at a time that is costly or inconvenient to viatris any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price see also “ viatris could incur operational difficulties or losses if we are unable to obtain the same types and level of services and resources that historically had been provided to the legacy upjohn business by pfizer if pfizer is unable to perform under the agreements entered into as part of the combination or if we are required to make payments to pfizer pursuant to indemnities agreed to as part of the combination  

in addition the manufacture of some of our products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems may arise during manufacturing at our or our thirdparty suppliers’ facilities for a variety of reasons including among others equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials natural disasters power outages labor or other civil unrest cybersecurity issues and environmental factors if problems arise during the production of a batch of product that batch of product may have to be discarded this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred 

if we or one of our suppliers experience any of the problems described above such problems could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

our future success is highly dependent on our ability to attract motivate and retain key personnel 

it is important that we attract motivate and retain qualified personnel in order to develop and commercialize new products manage our business and compete effectively competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical industry is intense we may lose key personnel or may be unable to attract retain and motivate qualified individuals or the associated costs may increase if we fail to attract develop incentivize and retain key scientific technical commercial regulatory or management personnel this could lead to loss of customers business disruption and a decline in revenues adversely affect the progress of pipeline products or otherwise adversely affect our operations additionally while we work to ensure that we have effective plans in place for management succession any anticipated or unanticipated management transition could create uncertainty which could disrupt or result in changes to our strategy and have a negative impact on our business current or 

prospective viatris employees also may experience uncertainty about their future roles at the company following the consummation andor integration of recent acquisitions including the combination our global restructuring program or our other strategic initiatives or programs which may adversely impact our ability to retain key personnel and other employees if we are unsuccessful in retaining our key employees or enforcing certain postemployment contractual provisions such as confidentiality or noncompetition provisions it may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

compliance risks 

we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act chinese anticorruption laws and similar worldwide anticorruption laws which impose restrictions on certain conduct and may carry substantial fines and penalties 

we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act chinese anticorruption laws and similar anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions these laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and some have record keeping requirements the failure to comply with these laws could result in substantial criminal andor monetary penalties we operate in jurisdictions that have experienced corruption bribery payoffs and other similar practices from timetotime and in certain circumstances such practices may be local custom we have implemented and trained relevant employees regarding internal control policies and procedures that mandate compliance with these anticorruption laws however we cannot be certain that these policies and procedures will protect us against liability there can be no assurance that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible if our employees or agents are found to have engaged in such practices we could suffer severe criminal or civil penalties reputational harm and other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

our competitors including branded pharmaceutical companies andor other third parties may allege that we or our suppliers are infringing upon their intellectual property including in an “at risk launch” situation which could result in substantial monetary damages impact our ability to launch a product andor our ability to continue marketing a product andor force us to expend substantial resources in resulting litigation the outcome of which is uncertain 

companies that produce branded pharmaceutical products and other patent holders routinely bring litigation against entities selling or seeking regulatory approval to manufacture and market generic forms of their branded products as well as other entities involved in the manufacture supply and other aspects relating to api and finished pharmaceutical products these companies and other patent holders may allege patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights as the basis for filing suit against an applicant for a generic product as well as others who may be involved in some aspect of research supply production distribution testing packaging or other processes litigation often involves significant expense and can delay or prevent introduction or sale of our generic products if patents are held valid and infringed by our products in a particular jurisdiction we andor our suppliers or partners may unless we or the suppliers or partners could obtain a license from the patent holder need to cease manufacturing and other activities including but not limited to selling in that jurisdiction we may also need to pay damages surrender or withdraw the product or destroy existing stock in that jurisdiction 

there also may be situations such as the decision to launch our insulin glargine and dimethyl fumarate products where we use our business judgment and decide to market and sell products directly or through third parties notwithstanding the fact that allegations of patent infringements and other thirdparty rights have not been finally resolved by the courts ie an “atrisk launch” the risk involved in doing so can be substantial because the remedies available to the owner of a patent for infringement may include among other things a reasonable royalty on sales damages measured by the profits lost by the patent holder or by profits earned by the infringer if there is a finding by a court of willful infringement the definition of which is subjective such damages may be increased by up to three times moreover because of the discount pricing typically involved with bioequivalent products patented branded products generally realize a substantially higher profit margin than generic or biosimilar products an adverse decision in a case such as this or a judicial order preventing us or our suppliers and partners from manufacturing marketing selling andor other activities necessary to the manufacture and distribution of our products could result in substantial penalties andor have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we rely on the effectiveness of our patents trademarks confidentiality agreements and other measures to protect our intellectual property rights 

our ability to commercialize any branded product successfully will largely depend upon our or any partner’s or supplier’s ability to obtain maintain and enforce patents and trademarks of sufficient scope to lawfully prevent third parties from developing andor marketing infringing products in the absence of adequate intellectual property protections or other barriers to entry competitors may adversely affect our branded products business by independently developing andor 

marketing substantially equivalent products it is also possible that we could incur substantial costs if we initiate litigation against others to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 

we may file patent filings covering the api formulation methods of making andor methods of using for our branded products and branded product candidates we may not be issued patents based on patent applications already filed or that we file in the future further due to other factors that affect patentability and if patents are issued they may be insufficient in scope to protect our branded products from generic competition as generics may be able to design around our patents patents are national in scope and therefore the issuance of a patent in one country does not ensure the issuance of a patent in any other country furthermore the patent position of companies in the pharmaceutical industry generally involves complex legal and factual questions and has been and remains the subject of significant litigation legal standards relating to scope and validity of patent claims are evolving and may differ in various countries any patents we have obtained or obtain in the future may be challenged invalidated or circumvented moreover the us patent and trademark office or any other governmental agency may commence or institute postgrant review inter partes review interference proceedings or other challenges to our patents or patent applications although many of our products do not have patent protection we continue to take steps to defend our patents for certain of our products for example many companies launched a generic to lyrica in japan in december 2020 despite pending patent litigation and the fact that these patents expire in july 2022 the patent litigation remains ongoing and we are taking legal steps to preserve the ability to exclusively provide to patients and physicians through patent expiry in july 2022 

in addition branded products often have market viability based upon the goodwill of the product name which typically is the subject of a trademark registration or filing our branded products may therefore also be subject to risks related to the loss of a trademark or patent or to competition from generic or other branded products challenges can come from other businesses individuals or governments and governments could require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property any challenge to or invalidation or circumvention of our intellectual property including patents or patent applications copyrights and trademark protection would be costly would require significant time and attention of our management and could cause a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we also rely on trade secrets unpatented proprietary knowhow trade dress regulatory exclusivity and continuing technological innovation that we seek to protect in part by confidentiality agreements with licensees suppliers employees and consultants these measures may not provide adequate protection for our unpatented technology if these agreements are breached it is possible that we will not have adequate remedies disputes may arise concerning the ownership of intellectual property or the applicability of confidentiality agreements furthermore our trade secrets and proprietary technology may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors or we may not be able to maintain the confidentiality of information relating to such products 

our ability to enforce intellectual property rights also depends on the laws of individual countries each country’s practices with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights and the extent to which certain countries may seek to engage in policies or practices that may weaken its intellectual property framework eg a policy of routine compulsory licensing or threat of compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical intellectual property if we are unable to adequately protect our technology trade secrets or proprietary knowhow or enforce our intellectual property rights this could cause a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

our reporting and payment obligations related to our participation in us federal healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and the va are complex and often involve subjective decisions that could change as a result of new business circumstances new regulations or agency guidance or advice of legal counsel any failure to comply with those obligations could subject us to investigation penalties and sanctions 

us federal laws regarding reporting and payment obligations with respect to a pharmaceutical company’s participation in federal healthcare programs including medicare medicaid and the va are complex because our processes for calculating applicable government prices and the judgments involved in making these calculations involve subjective decisions and complex methodologies these calculations are subject to risk of errors and differing interpretations in addition they are subject to review and challenge by the applicable governmental agencies and it is possible that such reviews could result in changes that may have material adverse legal regulatory or economic consequences 

any governmental agencies or authorities that have commenced or may commence an investigation of us relating to the sales marketing pricing quality or manufacturing of pharmaceutical products could seek to impose based on a claim of violation of antifraud and false claims laws or otherwise civil andor criminal sanctions including fines penalties and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs including medicare medicaid andor the va some of the applicable laws may impose liability even in the absence of specific intent to defraud furthermore should there be ambiguity with regard to how to properly calculate and report payments—and even in the absence of any such ambiguity—a governmental authority may 

take a position contrary to a position we have taken and may impose or pursue civil andor criminal sanctions governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations requirements or conditions of participation some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid there can be no assurance that our submissions will not be found by cms or the va to be incomplete or incorrect any failure to comply with the above laws and regulations and any such penalties or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and certain government inquiries and may experience unfavorable outcomes of such proceedings or inquiries 

we are or may be involved in various legal proceedings and certain government inquiries or investigations including but not limited to patent infringement product liability personal injury securities fraud claims with respect to the manufacture sale marketing and distribution of opioid products antitrust matters breach of contract and claims involving medicare medicaid andor va reimbursements or laws relating to sales marketing and pricing practices these proceedings may involve claims for or the possibility of fines and penalties involving substantial amounts of money or other relief including but not limited to civil or criminal fines and penalties and exclusion from participation in various government healthcarerelated programs 

viatris is subject to investigations and extensive regulation by government agencies in the united states china and other developed markets and emerging markets in which we operate criminal charges substantial fines andor civil penalties limitations on viatris’ ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions as well as reputational harm and increased public interest in the matter could result from government investigations with respect to government enforcement of state and federal laws including antitrust laws as well as private plaintiff litigation of socalled “pay for delay” patent settlements large verdicts settlements or government fines are possible especially in the us and eu additionally there is a possibility that the us federal government or state legislatures could enact legislation to limit patent settlements between pharmaceutical companies and deem such patent agreements as anticompetitive such a change could impact our ability to launch generic products prior to the originator’s patent expiry 

in connection with the combination the company has generally assumed liability for and control of pending and threatened legal matters relating to the upjohn business and has agreed to indemnify pfizer for liabilities arising out of such assumed legal matters pfizer however has agreed to retain various matters – including certain specified competition law matters – to the extent they arise from conduct during the predistribution period and has agreed to indemnify the company for liabilities arising out of such matters if pfizer were to dispute its retention of these matters or if there is an adverse outcome in the matters that pfizer has agreed to retain this could have an adverse impact on viatris in addition viatris has agreed to pay pfizer an amount equal to 57 of any losses actually incurred or suffered by viatris its predecessors or subsidiaries since july 29 2019 arising out of thirdparty actions relating to the manufacture distribution marketing promotion or sale of opioids by or on behalf of viatris its predecessors or subsidiaries if any of these legal proceedings or inquiries were to result in an adverse outcome the impact could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

emerging developments in the us legal landscape relative to the liability of generic pharmaceutical manufacturers for certain product liabilities claims could increase our exposure to litigation costs and damages although we maintain a combination of selfinsurance and commercial insurance no reasonable amount of insurance can fully protect against all risks because of the potential liability inherent in the business of producing pharmaceuticals for human consumption to the extent that a loss occurs depending on the nature of the loss and the level of insurance coverage maintained it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

in addition in limited circumstances entities that we have acquired are party to litigation in matters under which we are or may be entitled to indemnification by the previous owners even in the case of indemnification there are risks inherent in such indemnities and accordingly there can be no assurance that we will receive the full benefits of such indemnification or that we will not experience an adverse result in a matter that is not indemnified which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

refer to note 19 litigation included in part ii item 8 in this form 10k for further discussion of certain proceedings and litigation matters 

if we fail to comply with our corporate integrity agreement we could be subject to substantial penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs 

in august 2017 mylan inc and mylan specialty lp then subsidiaries of mylan and now subsidiaries of viatris entered into the cia” with the oighhs the cia has a fiveyear term and requires among other things enhancements to our 

compliance program fulfillment of reporting and monitoring obligations management certifications and resolutions from mylan inc’s board as well as that an independent review organization annually review various matters relating to the medicaid drug rebate program among other things if we fail to comply with the cia the oighhs may impose substantial monetary penalties or exclude us from federal healthcare programs including medicare medicaid or the va which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are increasingly dependent on it and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks including cybersecurity and data leakage risks 

significant disruptions to our it systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated it systems and infrastructure to operate our business we also have outsourced significant elements of our operations to third parties including as part of our tsas with pfizer some of these third parties are outside the us including significant elements of our it infrastructure and as a result we are managing many independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information the size and complexity of our it systems and those of our thirdparty vendors with whom we contract make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions in addition we and our vendors have experienced and expect to continue to experience phishing attempts firewall and business email compromises and other thirdparty attacks on our or our vendors’ it systems networks and infrastructures such attacks are increasingly sophisticated and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise including state and quasistate actors criminal groups “hackers” and others any security breach or other disruption to our or our vendors’ it infrastructure could also interfere with or disrupt our business operations including our manufacturing distribution rd sales andor marketing activities 

in the ordinary course of business we and our vendors collect store and transmit large amounts of confidential information including trade secrets or other intellectual property proprietary business information and personal information and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information the size and complexity of our and our vendors’ systems and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them also makes them potentially vulnerable to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees partners or vendors or from attacks by malicious third parties maintaining the security confidentiality and integrity of this confidential information including trade secrets or other intellectual property proprietary business information and personal information is important to our competitive business position however such information can be difficult to protect while we have taken steps to protect such information and to ensure that the thirdparty vendors’ on which we rely have taken adequate steps to protect such information there can be no assurance that our or our vendors’ efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches in our systems or the unauthorized or inadvertent wrongful use or disclosure of confidential or material nonpublic information that could adversely affect our business operations or result in the loss misappropriation andor unauthorized access use or disclosure of or the prevention of access to confidential information 

a breach of our or our vendors’ security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure unapproved dissemination misappropriation or misuse of trade secrets proprietary information or other confidential information whether as a result of theft hacking fraud trickery or other forms of deception or for any other cause could enable others to produce competing products use our proprietary technology or information andor adversely affect our business position further any such interruption security breach or loss misappropriation andor unauthorized access use or disclosure of confidential information including personal information regarding our patients and employees could result in financial legal business and reputational harm to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we are subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations in many different jurisdictions and countries where we do business and our or our vendors’ inability to comply could result in fines penalties or reputational damage and could impact the way we operate our business 

we are subject to federal state and international data privacy and security laws and regulations governing the collection use disclosure transmission and protection of personal information including healthrelated information as the legislative and regulatory landscape for data privacy and security continues to evolve around the world there has been an increasing focus on data privacy and security matters that may affect our business 

in the us hipaa governs the use disclosure and security of protected health information by hipaa covered entities and business associates several us states have enacted or proposed data privacy laws and regulations governing the confidentiality security use and disclosure of personal information which may impose greater restrictions than federal data privacy and security laws and regulations for example the state of california adopted the ccpa which took effect on january 1 2020 and california voters approved the california privacy rights act in november 2020 which will be effective on january 1 2023 these laws provide california consumers with increased privacy rights and protections with respect to their personal information including among others the right to know what personal information is collected used shared or sold 

and a right to deletion of personal information held by businesses and businesses’ service providers we may also be subject to other state data privacy and security breach notification laws state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws which impose requirements for the collection use disclosure transmission and protection of personal information each of these laws are subject to varying interpretations by courts and regulatory or government agencies creating complex compliance issues for us if we or the thirdparty vendors on which we rely fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to fines penalties or sanctions including criminal penalties 

outside of the us data protection laws including china’s cybersecurity law the eu’s gdpr eu member states implementing regulations and other jurisdictional data protection laws and regulations impose significant compliance obligations on our organization the gdpr contains data protection requirements in the eu and imposes a framework of obligations and restrictions governing the collection processing and the transmission of personal data to jurisdictions outside of the eu the gdpr affords individuals with a series of privacy rights related to the collection processing and transmission of their personal data the gdpr imposes significant compliance obligations including required processes and policies governing our collection transmission processing and use of individuals personal data in addition the gdpr includes significant penalties for noncompliance with fines up to the higher of €20 million or 4 of total annual worldwide revenue in general gdpr and other data protection laws and regulations could require adaptation of our technologies or practices to satisfy local country data protection requirements and standards 

other countries in which we operate including australia canada china india japan russia and south africa have or are developing laws and regulations governing the collection use securing and transmission of personal information as well that may affect our business or require us to adapt our technologies or practices recently brazil enacted significant data privacy legislation the lei geral de protecaode dados which became effective in august 2020 other countries including india russia and korea are considering legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements 

these and similar initiatives could increase the cost of developing implementing or maintaining our it systems require us to allocate more resources to compliance initiatives or increase our costs in addition a failure by us or our thirdparty vendors to comply with applicable data privacy and security laws may lead to government enforcement actions and private litigation which could result in financial legal business and reputational harm to us and could have a material adverse effect on the way we operate our business our financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers regulators investors and other stakeholders with respect to our environmental social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks 

companies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers regulators investors and other stakeholders related to their environmental social and governance practices and disclosure investor advocacy groups investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices especially as they relate to the environment climate change health and safety supply chain management diversity labor conditions and human rights both in our own operations and in our supply chain failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our reputation ability to do business with certain partners access to capital and our stock price 

in addition a growing number of our customers including certain government purchasers have adopted or may adopt procurement policies that include social and environmental requirements including for example requirements to conduct third party audits or these customers may seek to include such provisions in their procurement contract terms and conditions these social and environmental responsibility provisions and initiatives are subject to change vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and certain elements may be difficult andor cost prohibitive for us to comply with given the inherent complexity of our external supply chain and the global scope of our operations in certain circumstances in order to meet the requirements or standards of our customers we may be obligated to modify our sourcing practices or make other operational choices which may require additional investments and increase our costs or result in inefficiencies alternatively we may be ineligible to participate in bids or tenders in certain markets which may result in lost sales and revenues 

any of the factors mentioned above or the perception that we or our suppliers or contract manufacturers have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for such issues regardless of whether we are legally required to do so may damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

finance risks 

viatris’ future dividend payments cannot be guaranteed 

although viatris intends to pay quarterly dividends to its stockholders commencing in 2021 there is no assurance that viatris will declare and pay or have the ability to declare and pay any dividends on its common stock in the future whether dividends will be paid and the amount and frequency of any such dividend payments will depend upon a number of factors including viatris’ results of operation cash flows financial position competitive or commercial developments contractual or statutory restrictions and any other factors considered relevant by the viatris board such payments and the amount and frequency thereof are also subject to the other risks set forth in these risk factors in addition payment of a cash dividend will reduce the amount of cash available to the company for other activities including repayment of debt investment in the business or other capital expenditures 

if the intercompany terms of cross border arrangements that we have among our subsidiaries are determined to be inappropriate or ineffective our tax liability may increase 

we have potential tax exposures resulting from the varying application of statutes regulations and interpretations which include exposures on intercompany terms of crossborder arrangements among our subsidiaries including intercompany loans sales and services agreements in relation to various aspects of our business including manufacturing marketing sales and delivery functions although we believe our crossborder arrangements among our subsidiaries are based upon internationally accepted standards and applicable law tax authorities in various jurisdictions may disagree with and subsequently challenge the amount of profits taxed in their country which may result in increased tax liability including accrued interest and penalties which would cause our tax expense to increase and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we may not be able to maintain competitive financial flexibility and our corporate tax rate which could adversely affect us and our shareholders 

we believe that our structure and operations give us the ability to achieve competitive financial flexibility and a competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate we must make material assumptions underlying our expected tax rates including regarding the effect of certain internal reorganization transactions including various intercompany transactions we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be however because of among other reasons uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate potential changes of laws and interpretations thereof and the potential for tax audits or challenges our actual effective tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material furthermore the tax laws of other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate 

in addition we have invested in a number of clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualify for tax credits under section 45 of the code however our clean energy investments may not yield the tax credits that we expect them to produce whether as a result of a failure to satisfy the applicable conditions changes in irs rules or interpretation or a decrease in demand for coal congress could also modify or repeal section 45 of the code and remove the tax credits retroactively in the past we have impaired the value of certain of our clean energy investments and terminated others the ability to claim tax credits under these provisions is set to expire in 2021 and may not be renewed 

any of the factors discussed above could materially increase our overall effective income tax rate and income tax expense and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities and changes in income tax laws and tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate and income tax expense 

we are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions significant analysis and judgment are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are currently subject to tax audits and investigations in several jurisdictions and may be subject to other audits and investigations in the future the final determination of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our income tax provisions and accruals 

additionally changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in our overall profitability changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the results of audits and the examination of previously filed tax returns by taxing authorities and continuing assessments of our tax exposures could impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

currency fluctuations and changes in exchange rates could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

although we report our financial results in us dollars a significant portion of our revenues indebtedness and other liabilities and our costs are denominated in nonus currencies including among others the chinese renminbi euro swedish krona indian rupee korean won japanese yen australian dollar canadian dollar british pound sterling and brazilian real our results of operations and in some cases cash flows have in the past been and may in the future be adversely affected by certain movements in currency exchange rates defaults or restructurings in other countries could have a similar adverse impact in addition there remains significant international pressure on the chinese government to adopt a more flexible currency policy including from the us government which designated china as a “currency manipulator” in august 2019 and subsequently removed such designation in january 2020 which could result in greater fluctuation of the renminbi against the us dollar from time to time we may implement currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates however our hedging strategies may not be successful and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue to be subject to market fluctuations 

in addition viatris also faces risks arising from currency devaluations and the imposition of cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by its foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls for example in china the conversion of currency in the “capital account” eg capital items such as direct investments or loans requires the approval of the state administration for foreign exchange in china or its local branches which could materially and adversely affect the ability of our chinese operating subsidiaries and affiliated companies to obtain foreign currencies through equity financing or for capital expenditures therefore impeding our overall business operations while we currently have no need and do not intend to repatriate or convert cash held in countries that have significant restrictions or controls in place should we need to do so to fund our operations we may be unable to repatriate or convert such cash or be unable to do so without incurring substantial costs 

the occurrence of any of the above risks could cause a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

we have significant indebtedness which could lead to adverse consequences or adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness and any refinancing of this debt could be at significantly higher interest rates  

our level of indebtedness could have important consequences including but not limited to 

• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and investments dividend payments and other general corporate purposes 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to challenges and opportunities and changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and debt service requirements and other financing needs 

• increasing our vulnerability to increases in interest rates in general because a substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates 

• increasing our exposure to currency fluctuations since a significant portion of our indebtedness is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar such as our euro and japanese yen denominated debt and 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt 

our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our future operating performance and financial results which will be subject in part to factors beyond our control including interest rates general economic financial and business conditions and impacts of the covid19 pandemic if we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our indebtedness including the repayment of significant nearterm indebtedness we may need to refinance all or part of our existing indebtedness borrow more money or sell securities or assets some or all of which may not be available to us at acceptable terms or at all in addition we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business although the terms of our credit agreements and our bond indentures allow us to incur additional debt this is subject to certain limitations which may preclude us from incurring the amount of indebtedness we otherwise desire 

although viatris expects to maintain an investment grade credit rating a downgrade in the credit rating of viatris or any indebtedness of viatris or its subsidiaries could increase the cost of further borrowings or refinancings of such indebtedness limit access to sources of financing in the future or lead to other adverse consequences 

if we incur additional debt the risks described above could intensify if global credit markets contract future debt financing may not be available to us when required or may not be available on acceptable terms or at all and as a result we may be unable to grow our business take advantage of business opportunities respond to competitive pressures or satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

from time to time we issue variable rate debt based on libor or undertake interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on libor while the fca had announced that it intended to phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of 2021 the administrator of libor announced in november 2020 its intention to consult on ceasing publication of oneweek and twomonth us dollar libor settings at the end of 2021 and ceasing publication of the remaining overnight and one three six and 12month us dollar libor settings at the end of june 2023 while the proposal is not yet final the fca and other similar entities have supported this announcement and issued additional guidance us federal banking agencies also issued a joint statement in november 2020 encouraging banks to stop using libor for new contracts as soon as possible but in any event by the end of the year as of december 31 2020 less than 5 of our outstanding debt is linked to libor our credit facilities provide that should libor cease to exist we may amend the credit facilities to replace libor with i in the case of us dollars one or more rates based on sofr or ii another alternate benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similarly syndicated credit facilities syndicated in the us and denominated in the applicable currency for such alternative benchmarks and in each case including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar syndicated credit facilities syndicated in the us and denominated in the applicable currency for such benchmarks sofr or any other benchmark replacement may not be the economic equivalent of libor or achieve market acceptance similar to libor as a result our interest expense could increase in addition the overall financial market may be disrupted and there could be significant increases in benchmark rates or borrowing costs to borrowers as a result of the phaseout or replacement of libor disruption in the financial market significant increases in benchmark rates or borrowing costs or our inability to renegotiate agreements on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business financing activities financial condition and operations

there are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap any future changes in estimates judgments and assumptions used or necessary revisions to prior estimates judgments or assumptions or changes in accounting standards could lead to a restatement or revision to previously issued financial statements

we must maintain adequate internal controls and be able to provide an assertion as to the effectiveness of such controls on an annual basis 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports we spend a substantial amount of management and other employee time and resources to comply with laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure in the us such regulations include the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 sec regulations and the nasdaq listing standards in particular section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires management’s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestation as to the effectiveness of these controls by our independent registered public accounting firm if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our 

internal controls we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting additionally internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud therefore even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

there is a limited carveout offered by the sec staff in its published frequently asked questions on management’s report on internal control over financial reporting and certification of disclosure in exchange act periodic reports revised september 24 2007 that allows an acquired business to be excluded from management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting in circumstances where it is not possible to conduct an assessment of the acquired business’s internal controls and less than a year has passed since an acquisition while we have availed ourselves of this relief with respect to the upjohn business for purposes of management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 and were otherwise able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of such date there can be no assurance that our exclusion of internal controls at the upjohn business from our assessment will not be met with negative market reaction and will not have an adverse effect on our stock price 

in addition with respect to next year’s report it is possible that we may experience delays in implementing or be unable to implement necessary internal controls and procedures with respect to the upjohn business or we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any requested improvements in connection with the attestation process required of our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to section 404 accordingly either we or our independent registered public accounting firm or both may conclude that our internal controls are ineffective because of a material weakness in internal controls at upjohn business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

viatris could suffer additional losses due to asset impairment charges 

viatris has significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets on its balance sheet viatris expects to test goodwill for impairment during the second quarter of every fiscal year and on an interim date should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with asc 350 “goodwill and other intangible assets” if the fair value of a reporting unit is revised downward due to declines in business performance or other factors an impairment under asc 350 could result and a noncash charge could be required viatris expects to test intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable this assessment of the recoverability of finitelived intangible assets could result in an impairment and a noncash charge could be required such impairments could materially affect viatris’ reported net earnings business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

viatris may be adversely affected by disruptions in the credit markets including disruptions that reduce customers’ access to credit and increase the costs to customers of obtaining credit 

the credit markets have historically been volatile and therefore it is not possible to predict the ability of viatris’ customers to access shortterm financing and other forms of capital if a disruption in the credit markets were to occur viatris could be unable to refinance its outstanding indebtedness on reasonable terms or at all such a disruption could also pose a risk to viatris’ business if customers or suppliers are unable to obtain financing to meet their payment or delivery obligations in addition customers may decide to downsize defer or cancel contracts which could negatively affect our revenue 

further viatris had approximately 17 billion of floating rate debt as of december 31 2020 a one percentage point increase in the average interest rate of this debt would increase the combined interest expense by approximately 17 million per year accordingly a spike in interest rates would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

in connection with the combination viatris assumed or retained certain material obligations relating to defined benefit pension and termination benefits and retiree medical and dental benefits associated with legacy employees of the upjohn business andor sponsored by upjohn entities these liabilities and the related future funding obligations could restrict cash available for viatris’ operations capital expenditures dividend payments and other requirements and may materially adversely affect viatris’ financial condition and liquidity 

in connection with the combination viatris assumed material pension obligations associated with the upjohn business in particular viatris retained all liabilities relating to the puerto rico defined benefit pension plans and pfizer puerto 

rico retiree medical and dental plan in addition with respect to nonus defined benefit pension and termination benefit plans viatris generally established or designated plans similar to the pfizer plans to assume assets and liabilities for the benefit of legacy employees of the upjohn business viatris also retained liabilities for legacy employees of the upjohn business who participate in the japan defined benefit pension plan to the extent such employees were employed by the upjohn business on the date of the combination each of these liabilities and the related future payment obligations could restrict cash available for viatris’ operations capital expenditures dividend payments and other requirements and may materially affect viatris’ financial condition and liquidity

the expansion of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges 

to the extent that we seek to use social media tools as a means to communicate about our products andor business there are uncertainties as to the rules that apply to such communications or as to the interpretations that authorities will apply to the rules that exist as a result despite our efforts to monitor evolving social media communication guidelines and comply with applicable rules there is risk that our use of social media for such purposes may cause us to be found in violation of them our employees may knowingly or inadvertently make use of social media tools in ways that may not be aligned with our social media strategy may give rise to liability or could lead to the loss of material nonpublic information trade secrets or other intellectual property or public exposure of personal information including sensitive personal information of our employees clinical trial patients customers and others in addition negative posts or comments about us on any social media website could damage our reputation any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition results of operations cash flows andor stock price 

provisions in the viatris charter and viatris bylaws and of applicable law may prevent or delay an acquisition of viatris which could decrease the trading price of viatris common stock 

the viatris charter viatris bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of deterring takeovers by making such takeovers more expensive to the acquiror and by encouraging prospective acquirors to negotiate with the viatris board rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include the division of the viatris board into three classes of directors until the 2023 annual meeting of viatris stockholders which could have the effect of making the replacement of incumbent directors more timeconsuming and difficult rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings and the right of the viatris board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between viatris and any holder of 15 or more of viatris’ outstanding common stock 

these provisions are intended to protect viatris’ stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with the viatris board and by providing the viatris board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make viatris immune from takeovers however these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that the viatris board determines is not in the best interests of viatris and its stockholders accordingly if the viatris board determines that a potential business combination transaction is not in the best interests of viatris and its stockholders but certain stockholders believe that such a transaction would be beneficial to viatris and its stockholders such stockholders may elect to sell their shares in viatris and the trading price of viatris common stock could decrease these and other provisions of the

the viatris charter provides that unless viatris through approval of the viatris board otherwise consents in writing the court of chancery of the state of delaware or if and only if the court of chancery of the state of delaware dismisses such action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction another state court sitting in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of viatris any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer or other employees of viatris to viatris or its stockholders creditors or other constituents any action asserting a claim against viatris or any of its directors officers or other employees arising pursuant to or seeking to enforce any right obligation or remedy under any provision of the dgcl or the viatris charter or the viatris bylaws as each may be amended from time to time any action or proceeding asserting a claim against viatris or any of its directors officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine or any action or proceeding as to which the dgcl as it may be amended from time to time confers jurisdiction on the court of chancery of the state of delaware 

to the fullest extent permitted by law this exclusive forum provision will apply to state and federal law claims including claims under the federal securities laws including the securities act and the exchange act however viatris stockholders will not be deemed to have waived viatris’ compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ charters and bylaws has been challenged in legal proceedings and it is possible that in connection with claims arising under federal securities laws or otherwise a court could find the exclusive forum provision contained in the viatris charter to be inapplicable or unenforceable

viatris reports segment information on the basis of markets and geography in conjunction with the formation of viatris the company has changed its reportable segments from north america europe and rest of world to developed markets greater china janz and emerging markets this approach reflects the company’s focus on bringing its broad and diversified portfolio of branded complex generics and biosimilars and generic products to people in markets everywhere our developed markets segment comprises our operations primarily in north america and europe our greater china segment includes our operations in china taiwan and hong kong our janz segment reflects our operations in japan australia and new zealand our emerging markets segment encompasses our operations in countries with developing markets and emerging economies including countries in asia the middle east south and central america africa and eastern europe and also includes the company’s antiretroviral franchise 

certain market and industry factors 

the global pharmaceutical industry is a highly competitive and highly regulated industry as a result we face a number of industryspecific factors and challenges which can significantly impact our results the following discussion highlights some of these key factors and market conditions 

generic products particularly in the us generally contribute most significantly to revenues and gross margins at the time of their launch and even more so in periods of market exclusivity or in periods of limited generic competition as such the timing of new product introductions can have a significant impact on the company’s financial results the entrance into the market of additional competition generally has a negative impact on the volume and pricing of the affected products additionally pricing is often affected by factors outside of the company’s controlconversely generic products generally experience less volatility over a longer period of time in europe as compared to the us primarily due to the role of government oversight of healthcare systems in the region 

for branded products the majority of the product’s commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market exclusivity in the us and some other countries when market exclusivity expires and generic versions of a product are approved and marketed there can often be very substantial and rapid declines in the branded product’s sales for example several companies launched a generic to lyrica® in japan in december 2020 despite pending patent infringement litigation while the litigation remains ongoing the rate of generic conversion is significant and combined with market dynamics relating to the covid19 pandemic the company expects a significant reduction in the annual revenues of lyrica® 

certain markets in which we do business outside of the us have undergone governmentimposed price reductions and further governmentimposed price reductions are expected in the future such measures along with the tender systems discussed below are likely to have a negative impact on sales and gross profit in these markets however government initiatives in certain markets that appear to favor generic products could help to mitigate this unfavorable effect by increasing rates of generic substitution and penetration 

additionally a number of markets in which we operate outside of the us have implemented or may implement tender systems for generic pharmaceuticals in an effort to lower prices generally speaking tender systems can have an unfavorable impact on sales and profitability under such tender systems manufacturers submit bids that establish prices for generic pharmaceutical products upon winning the tender the winning company will receive priority placement for a period of time the tender system often results in companies underbidding one another by proposing low pricing in order to win the tender the loss of a tender by a third party to whom we supply api can also have a negative impact on our sales and profitability sales continue to be negatively affected by the impact of tender systems in certain countries 

recent developments 

    2020 restructuring program 

during the fourth quarter of 2020 viatris announced a significant global restructuring program in order to achieve synergies of 1 billion and ensure that the organization is optimally structured and efficiently resourced to deliver sustainable value to patients shareholders customers and other stakeholders viatris’ restructuring initiative incorporates and expands on the restructuring program announced by mylan nv earlier in 2020 as part of its business transformation efforts the company expects to optimize its commercial capabilities and enabling functions and close downsize or divest up to 15 manufacturing facilities globally that are deemed to be no longer viable either due to surplus capacity challenging market dynamics or a shift in its product portfolio toward more complex products as a result viatris expects that up to 20 of its global workforce of approximately 45000 may be impacted upon completion of the restructuring initiative 

for the committed restructuring actions the company expects to incur total pretax charges ranging between 11 billion and 14 billion such charges are expected to include between 350 million and 450 million of noncash charges mainly related to accelerated depreciation and asset impairment charges including inventory writeoffs the remaining estimated cash costs of between 750 million and 950 million are expected to be primarily related to severance and employee benefits expense as well as other costs including those related to contract terminations and decommissioning costs in addition management believes the potential annual savings related to these committed restructuring activities to be between 700 million and 900 million once fully implemented with most of these savings expected to improve operating cash flow 

2016 restructuring program   

mylan previously announced a restructuring program representing a series of actions in certain locations that are anticipated to further streamline its operations globally we have incurred total restructuring related costs of approximately 7330 million through december 31 2020 the 2016 restructuring program is substantially complete at december 31 2020 

in april 2018 the fda completed an inspection at mylan’s plant in morgantown west virginia and made observations through a form 483 in the fourth quarter of 2018 mylan received a warning letter related to the previously disclosed observations at the plant the issues raised in the warning letter were addressed within the context of the mylan’s comprehensive restructuring and remediation activities on may 11 2020 mylan received the closeout of the warning letter on december 11 2020 the company announced that it expects the morgantown plant to be closed or divested as part of the 2020 restructuring program

maintaining the health of our overall business 

access to capital markets and liquidity 

while currently we are not experiencing any negative liquidity trends related to the covid19 pandemic we continue to closely monitor developments and the potential negative impact on our operating performance and our ability to access the capital markets 

due to the company’s ability to generate significant cash flows from operations as well as its revolving credit agreement other shortterm borrowing facilities and access to capital markets we believe that we currently have and will maintain the ability to meet foreseeable liquidity needs 

impact on results of operations 

the global spread of covid19 has created significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption affecting the markets we serve and has had a negative impact on our current year results of operations the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will impact our business operations and financial results in future periods will depend on numerous evolving factors that are beyond our control and that we may not be able to accurately predict for additional information see results of operations in part ii item 7 

financial summary 

the table below is a summary of the company’s financial results for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the prior year period 



a detailed discussion of the company’s financial results can be found below in the section titled “results of operations” as part of this discussion we also report sales performance using the nongaap financial measures of “constant currency” net sales and total revenues these measures provide information on the change in net sales and total revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current period the comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency sales at the prior year’s foreign exchange rates we routinely evaluate our net sales and total revenues performance at constant currency so that sales results can be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rates thereby facilitating a periodtoperiod comparison of our operational activities and believe that this presentation also provides useful information to investors for the same reason 

more information about nongaap measures used by the company as part of this discussion including adjusted cost of sales adjusted gross margins adjusted net earnings and adjusted ebitda all of which are defined below are discussed further in this part ii item 7 under results of operations and results of operations — use of nongaap financial measures

1 currency impact is shown as unfavorable favorable 

2 the constant currency percentage change is derived by translating net sales or revenues for the current period at prior year comparative period exchange rates and in doing so shows the percentage change from 2020 constant currency net sales or revenues to the corresponding amount in the prior year 

3 for the year ended december 31 2020 other revenues in developed markets greater china janz and emerging markets were approximately 940 million 03 million 105 million and 213 million respectively

total revenues 

for the year ended december 31 2020 the company reported total revenues of 1195 billion compared to 1150 billion for the comparable prior year period representing an increase of 4455 million or 4 total revenues include both net sales and other revenues from third parties net sales for the year ended december 31 2020 were 1182 billion compared to 1137 billion for the comparable prior year period representing an increase of 4496 million or 4 other revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 were 1261 million compared to 1302 million for the comparable prior year period a decrease of 41 million 

the increase in net sales was primarily the result of increases in net sales in the developed markets segment of 3 the emerging markets segment of 8 and the greater china segment of 21 the company’s net sales were unfavorably impacted by the effect of foreign currency translation primarily reflecting changes in the us dollar as compared to the currencies of subsidiaries in india and other emerging markets partially offset by the favorable effect of foreign currency translation in countries within the eu the net unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation on current year net sales was approximately 280 million or less than 1 on a constant currency basis the increase in net sales was approximately 4776 million or 4 for the year ended december 31 2020 this increase was driven by net sales totaling 8649 million from the upjohn business following the consummation of the combination and new product sales partially offset by a decrease in net sales from existing products as a result of lower pricing and volumes w e estimate that the covid19 pandemic negatively impacted our 2020 net sales by approximately 3 primarily driven by lower retail pharmacy demand lower noncovid19 related patient hospital visits and a lower number of in person meetings with prescribers and payors 

from time to time a limited number of our products may represent a significant portion of our net sales gross profit and net earnings generally this is due to the timing of new product introductions and the amount if any of additional competition in the market our top ten products in terms of net sales in the aggregate represented approximately 23 for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively this percentage may fluctuate based upon the timing of new product launches seasonality and the timing of the discontinuation of products as a result of the combination we estimate that the percentage of our top products could change in future periods

approximately 182 million from higher restructuring and acquisition related costs as well as additional costs due to covid19 these unfavorable items were partially offset by gross profit from the combination of approximately 223 million and lower legacy business amortization and impairment charges compared to the prior year of approximately 238 million adjusted gross margins were approximately 54 and 53 for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively

use of nongaap financial measures 

whenever the company uses nongaap financial measures we provide a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measures to their most directly comparable us gaap financial measure investors and other readers are encouraged to review the related us gaap financial measures and the reconciliation of nongaap measures to their most directly comparable us gaap measure and should consider nongaap measures only as a supplement to not as a substitute for or as a superior measure to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with us gaap additionally since these are not measures determined in accordance with us gaap nongaap financial measures have no standardized meaning across companies or as prescribed by us gaap and therefore may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures or measures with the same title used by other companies 

management uses these measures internally for forecasting budgeting measuring its operating performance and incentivebased awards primarily due to acquisitions and other significant events which may impact comparability of our periodic operating results we believe that an evaluation of our ongoing operations and comparisons of our current operations with historical and future operations would be difficult if the disclosure of our financial results was limited to financial measures prepared only in accordance with us gaap we believe that nongaap financial measures are useful supplemental information for our investors and when considered together with our us gaap financial measures and the reconciliation to the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our operations the financial performance of the company is measured by senior management in part using adjusted metrics as described below along with other performance metrics 

adjusted cost of sales and adjusted gross margin 

we use the nongaap financial measure “adjusted cost of sales” and the corresponding nongaap financial measure “adjusted gross margin” the principal items excluded from adjusted cost of sales include restructuring acquisition related and other special items and purchase accounting amortization and other related items which are described in greater detail below 

adjusted net earnings 

adjusted net earnings is a nongaap financial measure and provides an alternative view of performance used by management management believes that primarily due to acquisition activity and other significant events an evaluation of the company’s ongoing operations and comparisons of its current operations with historical and future operations would be difficult if the disclosure of its financial results were limited to financial measures prepared only in accordance with us gaap management believes that adjusted net earnings is an important internal financial metric related to the ongoing operating performance of the company and are therefore useful to investors and that their understanding of our performance is enhanced by this measure actual internal and forecasted operating results and annual budgets used by management include adjusted net earnings 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda are nongaap financial measures that the company believes are appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate the company’s ability to comply with financial debt covenants and assess the company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness the company also believes that adjusted ebitda better focuses management on the company’s underlying operational results and true business performance and beginning in 2020 is used in part for management’s incentive compensation we calculate “ebitda” as us gaap net earnings loss adjusted for net contribution attributable to equity method investments income tax provision benefit interest expense and depreciation and amortization ebitda is further adjusted for sharebased compensation expense litigation settlements and other contingencies net and restructuring and other special items to determine “adjusted ebitda” these adjustments are generally permitted under our credit agreement in calculating adjusted ebitda for determining compliance with our debt covenants 

the significant items excluded from adjusted cost of sales adjusted net earnings ebitda and adjusted ebitda include 

purchase accounting amortization and other related items 

the ongoing impact of certain amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions of both businesses and assets is excluded from adjusted cost of sales adjusted net earnings ebitda and adjusted ebitda these amounts include the amortization of intangible assets inventory stepup property plant and equipment stepup and intangible asset impairment charges including for inprocess research and development for the acquisition of businesses accounted for under the provisions of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic 805 these purchase accounting impacts are excluded regardless of the financing method used for the acquisitions including the use of cash longterm debt the issuance of common stock contingent consideration or any combination thereof 

upfront and milestonerelated rd expenses 

these expenses and payments are excluded from adjusted net earnings and adjusted ebitda because they generally occur at irregular intervals and are not indicative of the company’s ongoing operations 

accretion of contingent consideration liability and other fair value adjustments 

the impact of changes to the fair value of contingent consideration and accretion expense are excluded from adjusted net earnings and adjusted ebitda because they are not indicative of the company’s ongoing operations due to the variability of the amounts and the lack of predictability as to the occurrence andor timing and management believes their exclusion is helpful to understanding the underlying ongoing operational performance of the business 

sharebased compensation expense 

sharebased compensation expense is excluded from adjusted net earnings and adjusted ebitda our sharebased compensation programs have become increasingly weighted toward performancebased compensation which leads to variability and to a lack of predictability as to the occurrence andor timing of amounts incurred as such management believes the exclusion of such amounts on an ongoing basis is helpful to understanding the underlying operational performance of the business 

restructuring acquisition related and other special items 

costs related to restructuring acquisition and integration activities and other actions are excluded from adjusted cost of sales adjusted net earnings and adjusted ebitda as applicable these amounts include items such as 

• costs related to formal restructuring programs and actions including costs associated with facilities to be closed or divested employee separation costs impairment charges accelerated depreciation incremental manufacturing variances equipment relocation costs decommissioning and other restructuring related costs

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of liquidity is net cash provided by operating activities which was 123 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 we believe that net cash provided by operating activities and available liquidity will continue to allow us to meet our needs for working capital capital expenditures and interest and principal payments on debt obligations nevertheless our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements and debt service obligations or fund planned capital expenditures will substantially depend upon our future operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 5719 million to 123 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 180 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 net cash provided by operating activities is derived from net loss earnings adjusted for noncash operating items gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities and changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from timing differences between the receipts and payments of cash including changes in cash primarily reflecting the timing of cash collections from customers payments to vendors and employees and tax payments in the ordinary course of business 

the net decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was principally due to the following

• a net increase of 2290 million in the amount of cash used through changes in inventory balances 

• a net decrease in the amount of cash provided by changes in income taxes of 543 million as a result of the level and timing of estimated tax payments made during the current period 

these items were partially offset by the following

other commitments 

the company is involved in various disputes governmental andor regulatory inquiries investigations and proceedings tax proceedings and litigation matters both in the us and abroad that arise from time to time some of which could result in losses including damages fines andor civil penalties andor criminal charges against the company these matters are often complex and have outcomes that are difficult to predict we have approximately 343 million accrued for legal contingencies at december 31 2020 

while the company believes that it has meritorious defenses with respect to the claims asserted against it and the assumed legal matters referenced above and intends to vigorously defend its position the process of resolving these matters is inherently uncertain and may develop over a long period of time and so it is not possible to predict the ultimate resolution of any such matter it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of any of the ongoing matters could have a material effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations cash flows ability to pay dividends andor stock price 

in conjunction with the combination viatris entered into a tsa with pfizer pursuant to which each party will provide certain limited transition services to the other party generally for an initial period of 24 months from closing date in addition to the monthly service fees under the tsa viatris has agreed to reimburse pfizer for fifty percent of the costs up to the first 380 million incurred to establish and wind down the tsa services viatris will be required to fully reimburse pfizer for total costs in excess of 380 million through the year ended december 31 2020 the company has incurred 531 million related to this provision of the tsa 

we are continuously evaluating the potential acquisition of products as well as companies as a strategic part of our future growth consequently we may utilize current cash reserves or incur additional indebtedness to finance any such acquisitions which could impact future liquidity in addition on an ongoing basis we review our operations including the evaluation of potential divestitures of products and businesses as part of our future strategy any divestitures could impact future liquidity 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2020 and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 



 

1 scheduled interest payments represent the estimated interest payments related to our outstanding borrowings under senior notes and other longterm debt variable debt interest payments are estimated using current interest rates 

2 other commitments include funding commitments related to the company’s clean energy investments agreements to purchase thirdparty manufactured products open purchase orders transition tax and estimated postemployment payments at december 31 2020 

due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future payments if any the following contingent payments have not been included in the table above 

we are contractually obligated to make potential future development regulatory and commercial milestone royalty andor profit sharing payments in conjunction with acquisitions we have entered into with third parties the most significant of these relates to the potential future consideration related to the acquisition of the exclusive worldwide rights to develop manufacture and commercialize a generic equivalent to glaxosmithkline’s advair® diskus incorporating pfizer’s respiratory delivery platform these payments are contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events and given the nature of these events it is unclear when we may be required to pay such amounts the amount of the contingent consideration liabilities was 2236 million at december 31 2020 in addition the company expects to incur approximately 8 million to 10 million of noncash accretion expense related to the increase in the net present value of the contingent consideration liabilities in 2021 

with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2020 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority as such 3911 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 

in the normal course of business viatris periodically enters into employment legal settlement and other agreements which incorporate indemnification provisions while the maximum amount to which viatris may be exposed under such agreements cannot be reasonably estimated the company maintains insurance coverage which management believes will effectively mitigate the company’s obligations under these indemnification provisions no amounts have been recorded in the consolidated financial statements with respect to the company’s obligations under such agreements 

we have entered into employment and other agreements with certain executives and other employees that provide for compensation and certain other benefits these agreements provide for severance payments under certain circumstances 

collaboration and licensing agreements 

we periodically enter into collaboration and licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies for the development manufacture marketing andor sale of pharmaceutical products our significant collaboration agreements are primarily focused on the development manufacturing supply and commercialization of multiple highvalue generic biologic compounds insulin analog products and respiratory products among other complex products under these agreements we have future potential milestone payments and codevelopment expenses payable to third parties as part of our licensing development and codevelopment programs payments under these agreements generally become due and are payable upon the satisfaction or achievement of certain developmental regulatory or commercial milestones or as development expenses are incurred on defined projects milestone payment obligations are uncertain including the prediction of timing and the occurrence of events triggering a future obligation and are not reflected as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets except obligations reflected as acquisition related contingent consideration refer to note 9 financial instruments and risk management included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of contingent consideration our potential maximum development milestones 

not accrued for at december 31 2020 totaled approximately 380 million we estimate that the amounts that may be paid in the next twelve months to be approximately 40 million these agreements may also include potential salesbased milestones and call for us to pay a percentage of amounts earned from the sale of the product as a royalty or a profit share the amounts disclosed do not include salesbased milestones or royalty or profit share obligations on future sales of product as the timing and amount of future sales levels and costs to produce products subject to these obligations is not reasonably estimable these salesbased milestones or royalty or profit share obligations may be significant depending upon the level of commercial sales for each product 

the company’s significant collaboration and licensing agreements include those with revance momenta theravance biopharma biocon and fkb refer to note 18 collaboration and licensing agreements included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional information related to our collaborations 

application of critical accounting policies 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k and are in accordance with us gaap 

included within these policies are certain policies which contain critical accounting estimates and therefore have been deemed to be “critical accounting policies” critical accounting estimates are those which require management to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and for which the use of different estimates which reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations we have identified the following to be our critical accounting policies the determination of net revenue provisions acquisitions intangible assets goodwill and contingent consideration income taxes and the impact of existing legal matters 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenues in accordance with asc 606 under asc 606 the company recognizes net revenue for product sales when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services revenues are recorded net of provisions for variable consideration including discounts rebates governmental rebate programs price adjustments returns chargebacks promotional programs and other sales allowances accruals for these provisions are presented in the consolidated financial statements as reductions in determining net sales and as a contra asset in accounts receivable net if settled via credit and other current liabilities if paid in cash amounts recorded for revenue deductions can result from a complex series of judgements about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions as such they have been identified as critical accounting estimates the following section briefly describes the nature of our provisions for variable consideration and how such provisions are estimated 

• chargebacks  the company has agreements with certain indirect customers such as independent pharmacies retail pharmacy chains managed care organizations hospitals nursing homes governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers which establish contract prices for certain products the indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products at these contracted prices alternatively certain wholesalers may enter into agreements with indirect customers that establish contract pricing for certain products which the wholesalers provide under either arrangement viatris will provide credit to the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect party and the wholesaler’s invoice price such credits are called chargebacks the provision for chargebacks is based on expected sellthrough levels by our wholesaler customers to indirect customers as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels we continually monitor our provision for chargebacks and evaluate our reserve and estimates as additional information becomes available a change of 5 would have an effect on our reserve balance of approximately 293 million 

• rebates promotional programs and other sales allowances  this category includes rebate and other programs to assist in product sales these programs generally provide that the customer receives credit directly related to the amount of purchases or credits upon the attainment of preestablished volumes also included in this category are prompt pay discounts administrative fees and price adjustments to reflect decreases in the selling prices of products a change of 5 would have an effect on our reserve balance of approximately 788 million 

• returns  consistent with industry practice viatris maintains a return policy that allows customers to return a product which varies country by country in accordance with local practices generally within a specified period prior six months and subsequent twelve months to the expiration date the company’s estimate of the provision for returns is generally based upon historical experience with actual returns generally returned products are destroyed and 

customers are refunded the sales price in the form of a credit a change of 5 would have an effect on our reserve balance of approximately 270 million 

• governmental rebate programs  government reimbursement programs in the us include medicare medicaid and state pharmacy assistance programs established according to statute regulations and policy manufacturers of pharmaceutical products that are covered by the medicaid program are required to pay rebates to each state based on a statutory formula set forth in the social security act medicare beneficiaries are eligible to obtain discounted prescription drug coverage from private sector providers in addition certain states have also implemented supplemental rebate programs that obligate manufacturers to pay rebates in excess of those required under federal law our estimate of these rebates is based on the historical trends of rebates paid as well as on changes in wholesaler inventory levels and increases or decreases in the level of sales we estimate discounts on branded prescription drug sales to medicare part d participants in the medicare “coverage gap” based on historical experience of prescriptions and utilization expected to result in the discount of the “coverage gap” 

outside the us the majority of our pharmaceutical sales are contractually or legislatively governed in certain european countries certain rebates are calculated on the governments total pharmaceutical spending or on specific product sale thresholds we utilize historical data and obtain third party information to determine the adequacy of these accruals also this provision includes price reductions that are mandated by law outside of the us 

a change of 5 would have an effect on our reserve balance of approximately 157 million 

the following is a rollforward of the categories of variable consideration during 2020 



accruals for these provisions are presented in the consolidated financial statements as reductions in determining net revenues and in accounts receivable and other current liabilities accounts receivable are presented net of allowances relating to these provisions which were comprised of the following at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 



we have not made and do not anticipate making any significant changes to the methodologies that we use to measure provisions for variable consideration however the balances within these reserves can fluctuate significantly through the consistent application of our methodologies historically we have not recorded in any current period any material amounts related to adjustments made to prior period reserves 

acquisitions intangible assets goodwill and contingent consideration 

the company accounts for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the provisions of asc 805 which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values the cost to acquire businesses is allocated to the underlying net assets of the acquired business based on estimates of their respective fair values amounts allocated to acquired iprd are capitalized at the date of acquisition and at that time such iprd assets have indefinite lives as products in development are approved for sale amounts are allocated to product rights and licenses and will be amortized over their estimated useful lives finitelived intangible assets are amortized over the expected life of the asset any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill refer to note 4 acquisitions and other transactions included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further additional information regarding the company’s acquisitions including the acquisition accounting related to the combination 

purchases of developed products and licenses that are accounted for as asset acquisitions are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized over an estimated useful life iprd assets acquired as part of an asset acquisition are expensed immediately if they have no alternative future uses 

the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as asset lives can materially impact our results of operations fair values and useful lives are determined based on among other factors the expected future period of benefit of the asset the various characteristics of the asset and projected cash flows because this process involves management making estimates with respect to future sales volumes pricing new product launches government reform actions anticipated cost environment and overall market conditions and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded these estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates 

the company records contingent consideration resulting from business acquisitions at its estimated fair value on the acquisition date each reporting period thereafter the company revalues these obligations and records increases or decreases in their fair value as adjustments to litigation settlements and other contingencies net within the consolidated statements of operations changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to the discount rates payment periods and adjustments in the probability of achieving future development steps regulatory approvals market launches sales targets and profitability these fair value measurements represent level 3 measurements as they are based on significant inputs not observable in the market 

significant judgment is employed in determining the assumptions utilized as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent measurement period accordingly changes in the assumptions described above could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

the company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable based on management’s assessment of the fair value of the company’s reporting units as compared to their related carrying value under the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test if we choose to use qualitative factors and determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then the goodwill impairment test would be required the goodwill impairment test requires the company to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount is less than its fair value then no impairment is recognized if the carrying amount recorded exceeds the fair value calculated an impairment charge is recorded for the difference the judgments made in determining the projected cash flows used to estimate the fair value can materially impact the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

mylan historically performed its annual goodwill impairment test on april 1st as a result of the decline in the mylan’s share price during the first quarter of 2020 and the general uncertainty and volatility in the economic environments in which the company operates including the impacts of the covid19 pandemic the company performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of march 31 2020 and its annual goodwill impairment test as of april 1 2020 

mylan performed both the interim and annual goodwill impairment tests on a quantitative basis for its four reporting units north america generics north america brands europe and rest of world in estimating each reporting unit’s fair value mylan performed an extensive valuation analysis utilizing both income and marketbased approaches except for the north america brands reporting unit where the fair value was estimated utilizing the income approach the determination of 

the fair value of the reporting units requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting unit’s expected future cash flows these estimates and assumptions utilizing level 3 inputs primarily include but are not limited to market multiples control premiums the discount rate terminal growth rates operating income before depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures forecasts the following describes the valuation methodologies used to derive the estimated fair value of the reporting units 

income approach  under this approach to determine fair value we discounted the expected future cash flows of each reporting unit we used a discount rate which reflected the overall level of inherent risk and the rate of return an outside investor would have expected to earn to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of our model we used a terminal value approach under this approach we used ebitda in the final year of our model adjusted to estimate a normalized cash flow applied a perpetuity growth assumption and discounted by a perpetuity discount factor to determine the terminal value we incorporated the present value of the resulting terminal value into our estimate of fair value 

marketbased approach  the company also utilizes a marketbased approach to estimate fair value principally utilizing the guideline company method which focuses on comparing our risk profile and growth prospects to a select group of publicly traded companies with reasonably similar guidelines 

as of march 31 2020 and april 1 2020 the allocation of goodwill among the reporting units was as follows north america generics 260 billion north america brands 065 billion europe 443 billion and rest of world 165 billion 

as of march 31 2020 and april 1 2020 mylan determined that the fair value of the north america generics north america brands and rest of world reporting units was substantially in excess of the respective unit’s carrying value however when compared to the april 1 2019 test the fair value of the overall business declined because of future forecasts and the decline in share price 

for the europe reporting unit the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 12 billion or 110 for both the interim and annual goodwill impairment test as it relates to the income approach for the europe reporting unit at march 31 2020 and april 1 2020 the company forecasted cash flows for the next 5 years during the forecast period the revenue compound annual growth rate was approximately 75 a terminal year value was calculated with a 20 revenue growth rate applied the discount rate utilized was 110 and the estimated tax rate was 255 under the marketbased approach we utilized an estimated range of market multiples of 80 to 95 times ebitda plus a control premium of 150 if all other assumptions are held constant a reduction in the terminal value growth rate by 35 or an increase in discount rate by 35 would result in an impairment charge for the europe reporting unit 

due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates actual results could differ from those estimates in addition changes in underlying assumptions especially as it relates to the key assumptions detailed could have a significant impact on the fair value of the reporting units 

as a result of the combination and the integration of our portfolio across our regions the company changed its reportable segments the company now has four reportable segments on a geographic basis developed markets greater china janz and emerging markets subsequent to the change in segments our reporting units for allocating and evaluating goodwill impairment will be north america europe greater china janz and emerging markets 

the carrying values of longlived assets which include property plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated periodically in relation to the expected future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying assets and monitored for other potential triggering events we have assessed the recoverability of certain longlived assets principally finitelived intangible assets contained within the reporting units whenever certain impairment indicators are present any impairment of these assets must be considered prior to our impairment review of goodwill the assessment for impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the longlived assets or asset grouping by analyzing the expected future undiscounted pretax cash flows specific to the asset or asset grouping if the carrying amount is greater than the undiscounted cash flows the company recognizes an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows 

significant management judgment is involved in estimating the recoverability of these assets and is dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions used in making these estimates as well as how the estimates compare to the eventual future operating performance of the specific asset or asset grouping for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 the company recorded 450 million 423 million and 1063 million respectively of impairment charges for finitelived intangible assets which were recorded as a component of amortization expense at december 31 2020 and 2019 the company’s finitelived intangible assets totaled 2968 billion and 1153 billion respectively changes to any of the 

company’s assumptions related to the estimated fair value based on the discounted cash flows including discount rates or the competitive environment related to the assets could lead to future material impairment charges any future longlived assets impairment charges could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s indefinitelived intangible assets principally iprd are tested at least annually for impairment or upon the occurrence of a triggering event the impairment test for iprd consists of a comparison of the asset’s fair value with its carrying value impairment is determined to exist when the fair value of iprd assets which is based upon updated forecasts and commercial development plans is less than the carrying value of the assets being tested for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 the company recorded 374 million 1383 million and 1177 million respectively of impairment charges which were recorded as a component of amortization expense at december 31 2020 and 2019 the company’s iprd assets totaled 807 million and 1203 million respectively 

the fair value of both iprd and finitelived intangible assets was determined based upon detailed valuations employing the income approach which utilized level 3 inputs as defined in note 9 financial instruments and risk management included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k changes to any of the company’s assumptions including changes to or abandonment of development programs regulatory timelines discount rates or the competitive environment related to the assets could lead to future material impairment charges 

income taxes 

we compute our income taxes based on the statutory tax rates and tax reliefs available to viatris in the various jurisdictions in which we generate income significant judgment is required in determining our income taxes and in evaluating our tax positions we establish reserves in accordance with viatris’ policy regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes our policy provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position be recognized in viatris’ financial statements only if the position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the position we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the settlement of a tax audit our provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our provision for income taxes in the period of resolution or expiration of the underlying statutes of limitation based on this evaluation as of december 31 2020 our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits totaled 3911 million of which 2640 million was recorded in connection with the combination and is subject to pfizer’s indemnification obligations to viatris under the tax matters agreement 

management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets a significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred in certain taxing jurisdictions over the threeyear period ended december 31 2020 such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for future growth 

based on this evaluation and other factors as of december 31 2020 a valuation allowance of 4436 million has been recorded in order to measure only the portion of the deferred tax asset that more likely than not will be realized the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable however could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as projections for growth when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers all available evidence including historical information longterm forecasts of future taxable income and possible tax planning strategies amounts recorded for valuation allowances can result from a complex series of estimates assumptions and judgments about future events due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates assumptions and judgments actual results could differ materially any future increases to the company’s valuation allowances could materially impact the company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations at december 31 2020 and 2019 the company’s net deferred tax assets totaled 215 billion and 7031 million respectively 

a variance of 5 between estimated reserves and valuation allowances and actual resolution and realization of these tax items would have an effect on our reserve balance and valuation allowance of approximately 418 million 

legal matters 

viatris is involved in various legal proceedings some of which involve claims for substantial amounts an estimate is made to accrue for a loss contingency relating to any of these legal proceedings if it is probable that a liability was incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated because of the subjective nature inherent in assessing the outcome of litigation and because of the potential that an adverse outcome in a legal proceeding could 

have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows andor ordinary share price such estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates 

a variance of 5 between estimated and recorded litigation reserves and actual resolution of certain legal matters would have an effect on our litigation reserve balance of approximately 172 million refer to note 19 litigation included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of litigation matters 

impact of currency fluctuations and inflation 

because our results are reported in us dollars changes in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the local currencies in the markets in which we operate mainly the euro indian rupee chinese renminbi japanese yen australian dollar canadian dollar pound sterling and south korean won affect our results as previously noted we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our revenues or operations in any of the past three years 

recent accounting pronouncements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

a significant portion of our revenues and earnings are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we seek to manage this foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities 

from time to time foreign exchange risk is managed through the use of foreign currency forwardexchange contracts these contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency assets and liabilities that arise from operations and from intercompany loans viatris’ primary areas of foreign exchange risk relative to the us dollar are the euro indian rupee chinese renminbi japanese yen australian dollar canadian dollar pound sterling and south korean won any unhedged foreign exchange exposures continue to be subject to market fluctuations 

our financial instrument holdings at year end were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes the fair values of these instruments were determined as follows 

• foreign currency forwardexchange contracts — net present values 

• foreign currency denominated receivables payables debt and loans — changes in exchange rates 

in this sensitivity analysis we assumed that the change in one currency’s rate relative to the us dollar would not have an effect on other currencies’ rates relative to the us dollar all other factors were held constant 

if there were an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates of 10 the expected net effect on net income related to viatris’s foreign currency denominated financial instruments would not be material 

the company is also exposed to translation risk on nonus dollardenominated net assets nonus dollar borrowings principally our euro denominated longterm debt are used to hedge the foreign currency exposures of our net investment in certain foreign affiliates and are designated as hedges of net investments the foreign exchange gains or losses on these hedges is included in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss if our net investment decreases below the equivalent value of the nonus debt borrowings the change in the remeasurement basis of the debt would be subject to recognition in net income as changes occur 

interest rate and longterm debt risk 

viatris’ exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from our us dollar and euro borrowings and us dollar investments we invest primarily on a variablerate basis and we borrow on both a fixed and variable basis in order to maintain a certain ratio of fixed to variable rate debt from time to time depending on market conditions viatris will use derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to fix interest rates on variablerate borrowings or to convert fixedrate borrowings to variable interest rates 

as of december 31 2020 viatris’ outstanding fixed rate borrowings consist principally of 2330 billion notional amount of senior notes and euro notes generally the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall as of december 31 2020 the fair value of our outstanding fixed rate senior notes and euro notes was approximately 2590 billion a 100 basis point change in interest rates on viatris’ variable rate debt net of interest rate swaps would result in a change in interest expense of approximately 170 million per year
