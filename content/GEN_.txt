seasonality 

as is typical for many consumer technology companies portions of our business are impacted by seasonality however we believe the net impact on our business is limited seasonal behavior in orders primarily reflects consumer spending patterns where our fiscal third and fourth quarters are higher due to the holidays in our third quarter as well as followon holiday purchases and the us tax filing season which typically is in our fourth quarter revenue generally reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than orders because of our subscription business model as a large portion of our inperiod revenues are recognized ratably from our deferred revenue balance

industry overview  market opportunity 

cyber safety is a growing market fueled by the increase in activities online over the years as well as the years ahead the core markets that we participate in are security identity and privacy we believe the cyber safety market will continue to expand beyond these core markets and grow significantly driven by the growing number of people connected to the internet who have a digital life 

the cyber threat landscape is larger and more complicated than ever before exposing consumers to an increased risk to their digital lives the digitization of the world and the overlap between the physical and digital world is growing at a fast pace new technologies smart devices digital identities and an increasingly more connected world means consumers will encounter a range of new cyber safety challenges consumer demands and behaviors are rapidly changing and driving more activities online from shopping socializing working banking to other activities in healthcare entertainment and so much more almost every aspect of a person’s life has a digital component unfortunately many of those activities are left unprotected and attackers are exploiting this larger opportunity and the inherent security and privacy vulnerabilities cybercriminals have not only expanded their reach but the sophistication of digital threats and attacks are becoming increasingly more consumerrelated 

cybercrime and the ways in which cybercriminals target consumers continue to evolve along with behaviors and technology cybercrime encompasses any crime committed with devices over the internet and includes crimes where i malicious software or unauthorized access is detected on a device network or online account such as email social media online banking crypto currency online retail gaming online entertainment etc and unauthorized access or connection to cloud service accounts ii an individual is digitally victimized through a data breach cyber theft cyber extortion or fraud stolen personally identifiable information identity theft etc iii online stalking bullying or harassment is inflicted or iv attacks related to privacy or disinformation such as online tracking protection identity impersonation disinformation on social media deepfakes nontrustworthy wifi network eviltwin attacks etc 

as cybercrime becomes an intensifying threat to our world consumers are increasingly concerned our annual norton cyber safety insights report examines the impact of cybercrime and consumers’ online behaviors and concerns related to their online security privacy and identity according to the 2022 report which is based on research conducted online by the harris poll on behalf of us more than 415 million people across 10 countries were victims of cybercrime and more than 81 million people were victims of identity theft over the past year cybercrime victims collectively spent nearly 44 billion hours trying to resolve their issues and half of these victims were impacted financially for more insights or information related to our norton cyber safety insights report please visit httpswwwnortonlifelockcomusennortoncybersafetycenter

competitive landscape 

we operate in a highly competitive and dynamic environment we face global competition from a broad range of companies including software vendors focusing on cyber safety solutions operating system providers such as apple google and microsoft and ‘pure play’ companies that currently specialize in one or a few particular segments of the market and many of which are expanding their product portfolios into different segments we believe the competitive factors in our market include innovation access to a breadth of identity and consumer transaction data broad and effective service offerings brand recognition technology effective and costefficient customer acquisition having a strong retention rate customer satisfaction price convenience of purchase ease of use frequency of upgrades and updates and quality and reliable customer service our competitors may vary by offering geography business model and channel 

our principal competitors are set forth below 

• security our principal competitors in this segment include apple avast bitdefender google kaspersky mcafee microsoft and trend micro

• other competitors in addition to competition from independent software vendors such as avast bitdefender kaspersky mcafee and trend micro and from os providers such as apple google and microsoft we also face competition from other companies that currently focus on one or a few cyber safety or adjacent segments but are developing additional competing products and expanding their portfolios into new segments such as ‘pure play’ companies isps big tech platform providers insurance companies and financial service organizations 

we believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the strength of our technology people product offerings and presence in all of the current key cyber safety categories however some of our competitors have greater financial technical marketing distribution or other resources than we do including in new cyber safety and digital life segments we may enter which consequently affords them competitive advantages as a result they may be able to devote greater resources to develop promote and sell their offerings deliver competitive offerings at lower prices or for free and introduce new solutions and respond to market developments and customer requirements and preferences more quickly or cost effectively than we can in addition for individual solutions or features smaller wellfunded competitors may be able to innovate and adapt more nimbly to the dynamic nature of the market and shift consumer needs 

for more information on the risks associated with our competitors please see “risk factors” – risks related to our business strategy and industry – “we operate in a highly competitive and dynamic environment and if we are unable to compete effectively we could experience a loss in market share and a reduction in revenue” and “we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully” in item 1a included in this annual report on form 10k

risks related to covid19 

the covid19 pandemic has affected how we are operating our business and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain 

the covid19 pandemic has had widespread rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts on global society economies financial markets and business practices at the onset of the pandemic to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees partners and thirdparty service providers we facilitated a workfromhome requirement for most employees and established sitespecific covid19 prevention protocols we continue to monitor the situation and over the past several months have adjusted our policies and protocols to reflect changes to public health regulations and guidance a majority of our offices are now open to employees on a voluntary return basis and we anticipate opening the remaining offices on a voluntary return basis within the first quarter of fiscal 2023 to date we have not seen any meaningful negative impact on our customer success efforts sales and marketing efforts or employee productivity nevertheless as more employees partners or thirdparty services providers return to work during the covid19 pandemic the risk of inadvertent transmission of covid19 through human contact could still occur and result in litigation 

while the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted many sectors of the us and global economies the consumer cyber safety market experienced increased demand as the pandemic greatly accelerated the digital lives of people around the world however with the extended duration of the pandemic and the easing of prevention protocols and restrictions we are seeing decreasing demand and increased competition in addition should the negative macroeconomic impacts of the covid19 pandemic persist or worsen we may experience continued slowdowns in our business activity and an increase in cancellations by customers or a material reduction in our retention rate in the future especially in the event of a prolonged recession a prolonged recession could adversely affect demand for our offerings retention rates and harm our business and results of operations particularly in light of the fact that our solutions are discretionary purchases and thus may be more susceptible to macroeconomic pressures as well impact the value of our common stock ability to refinance our debt and our access to capital 

the duration and extent of the impact from the covid19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately forecasted at this time such as the severity and transmission rate of new variants of the disease the extent effectiveness and acceptance of containment actions such as vaccination programs and the impact of these and other factors on our employees customers and the overall demand for our products partners and thirdparty service providers if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively and if the macroeconomic conditions of the general economy or the industries in which we operate do not improve or deteriorate further our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

risks related to our business strategy and industry 

if we are unable to develop new and enhanced solutions or if we are unable to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our existing solutions our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our future success depends on our ability to effectively respond to evolving threats to consumers as well as competitive technological developments and industry changes by developing or introducing new and enhanced solutions on a timely basis we have in the past incurred and will continue to incur significant research and development expenses as we focus on organic growth through internal innovation we believe that we also must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to decrease our reliance on third parties if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected additionally we must continually address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends and competitive developments customers may require features and capabilities that our current solutions do not have our failure to develop new solutions and improve our existing solutions to satisfy customer preferences and effectively compete with other market offerings in a timely and costeffective manner may harm our ability to retain our customers and attract new customers a loss of customers would adversely impact our business and operating results 

the development and introduction of new solutions involve a significant commitment of time and resources and are subject to a number of risks and challenges including but not limited to 

• lengthy development cycles 

• evolving industry and regulatory standards and technological developments by our competitors and customers 

• rapidly changing customer preferences 

• evolving platforms operating systems and hardware products such as mobile devices 

• product and service interoperability challenges with customer’s technology and thirdparty vendors 

• the integration of products and solutions from acquired companies 

• entering into new or unproven market segments and 

• executing new product and service strategies 

table of conten ts 

in addition third parties including operating systems and internet browser companies may take steps to further limit the interoperability of our solutions with their own products and services in some cases to promote their own offerings this could delay the development of our solutions or our solutions may be unable to operate effectively this could also result in decreased demand for our solutions decreased revenue and harm to our reputation and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges or if our new or improved solutions are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

we operate in a highly competitive and dynamic environment and if we are unable to compete effectively we could experience a loss in market share and a reduction in revenue 

we operate in intensely competitive and dynamic markets that experience frequent and rapid technological developments changes in industry and regulatory standards changes in customer requirements and preferences and frequent new product introductions and improvements if we are unable to anticipate or react to these continually evolving conditions we could experience a loss of market share and a reduction in our revenues which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results to compete successfully we must maintain an innovative research and development effort to develop new solutions and enhance our existing solutions effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors as well as the ways our information is accessed used and stored by our customers and appropriately respond to competitive strategies 

we face competition from a broad range of companies including software vendors focusing on cyber safety solutions operating system providers such as apple google and microsoft and ‘pure play’ companies that currently specialize in one or a few particular segments of the market and many of which are expanding their product portfolios into different segments many of these competitors offer solutions or are currently developing solutions that directly compete with our offerings we also face growing competition from other technology companies as well as from companies in the identity threat protection space such as credit bureaus further many of our competitors are increasingly developing and incorporating into their products data protection software and other competing cyber safety products such as antivirus protection or vpn often free of charge that compete with our offerings our competitive position could be adversely affected by the functionality incorporated into these products rendering our existing solutions obsolete in addition the introduction of new products or services by competitors andor market acceptance of products or services based on emerging or alternative technologies could make it easier for other products or services to compete with our solutions 

we anticipate facing additional competition as new participants continue to enter the cyber safety market and as our current competitors seek to increase their market share and expand their existing offerings some of our competitors have greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do including in new cyber safety and digital life segments and consequently may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their products instead of ours including through investing more in internal innovation than we can and through benefiting from unique access to customer engagement points further consolidation among our competitors and within our industry or in addition to other changes in the competitive environment such as greater vertical integration from key computing and operating system suppliers could result in larger competitors that compete more frequently with us 

in addition to competing with these vendors directly for sales to endusers of our solutions we compete with them for the opportunity to have our solutions bundled with the offerings of our strategic partners such as computer hardware original equipment manufacturers oems and internet service providers isps and operating systems our competitors could gain market share from us if any of these strategic partners replace our solutions with those of our competitors or with their own solutions similarly they could gain market share from us if these partners more actively promote our competitors’ solutions or their own solutions than our solutions in addition software vendors who have bundled our solutions with theirs may choose to bundle their solutions with their own or other vendors’ solutions or may limit our access to standard interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop solutions for their platform in the future further product development by these vendors could cause our solutions to become redundant which could significantly impact our sales and operating results 

we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully 

the intense competition we face in addition to general and economic business conditions can put pressure on us to change our pricing practices if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain solutions or provide offerings or offer free introductory products that compete with ours we may need to lower prices or offer similar free introductory products in order to compete successfully similarly if external factors such as economic conditions or market trends require us to raise our prices our ability to acquire new customers and retain existing customers may be diminished any such changes may reduce revenue and margins and could adversely affect our financial results 

additionally our business may be affected by changes in the macroeconomic environment our solutions are discretionary purchases and customers may reduce or eliminate their discretionary spending on our solutions during a difficult macroeconomic environment although we did not experience a material increase in cancellations by customers or a material reduction in our retention rate in fiscal 2021 or fiscal 2022 we may experience such an increase or reduction in the future especially in the event of a prolonged recession or a worsening of current conditions as a result of the covid19 pandemic in addition during a recession consumers may experience a decline in their credit or disposable income which may result in less demand for our solutions as a result we may have to lower our prices or make other changes to our pricing model to address these dynamics any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results

in addition in january 2021 we acquired germanybased avira many of avira’s users are freemium subscribers meaning they do not pay for its basic services much of our anticipated growth in connection with the avira acquisition is attributable to attracting and converting avira’s freemium users to a paid subscription option numerous factors however may impede our ability to attract retain and convert these users into paying customers 

if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively or if our partners choose not to market and sell our solutions to their customers our operating results could be adversely affected 

a portion of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels including but not limited to distributors that sell our products to endusers and other resellers and oem partners that incorporate our products into or bundle our products with their products these channels involve a number of risks including 

• our resellers distributors and oems are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our solutions to their customers 

• our reseller and distributor agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause and our oem partners may terminate or renegotiate their arrangements with us and new terms may be less favorable due to competitive conditions in our markets and other factors 

• our resellers distributors and oems may encounter issues or have violations of applicable law or regulatory requirements or otherwise cause damage to our reputation through their actions 

• our resellers and distributors frequently market and distribute competing solutions and may from time to time place greater emphasis on the sale of these competing solutions due to pricing promotions and other terms offered by our competitors 

• any consolidation of electronics retailers can increase their negotiating power with respect to software providers such as us and any decline in the number of physical retailers could decrease the channels of distribution for us 

• the continued consolidation of online sales through a small number of larger channels has been increasing which could reduce the channels available for online distribution of our solutions and 

• sales through our partners are subject to changes in general economic conditions strategic direction competitive risks and other issues that could result in a reduction of sales or cause our partners to suffer financial difficulty which could delay payments to us affecting our operating results 

if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels successfully these channels may conflict with one another or otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate which could reduce our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our competitive position 

our revenue and operating results depend significantly on our ability to retain our existing customers convert existing nonpaying customers to paying customers and add new customers 

we generally sell our solutions to our customers on a monthly or annual subscription basis customers may choose not to renew their membership with us at any time renewing customers may require additional incentives to renew may not renew for the same contract period or may change their subscriptions we therefore may be unable to retain our existing customers on the same or on more profitable terms if at all in addition we may not be able to accurately predict or anticipate future trends in customer retention or effectively respond to such trends 

our customer retention rates may decline or fluctuate due to a variety of factors including the following 

• our customers’ levels of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our solutions and the value they place on our solutions 

• the quality breadth and prices of our solutions 

• our general reputation and events impacting that reputation 

• the services and related pricing offered by our competitors including increasing availability and efficacy of free solutions 

• disruption by new services or changes in law or regulations that impact the need for efficacy of our products and services 

• changes in autorenewal regulations 

• our customers’ dissatisfaction with our efforts to market additional products and services 

• our customer service and responsiveness to the needs of our customers and 

• changes in our target customers’ spending levels as a result of general economic conditions inflationary pressures or other factors 

declining customer retention rates could cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected or decline and our operating results gross margins and business will be harmed

our acquisitions and divestitures create special risks and challenges that could adversely affect our financial results 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire or divest businesses or assets for example in 2019 we completed the sale of certain of our enterprise security assets to broadcom inc the broadcom sale and in january 2021 we completed the acquisition of avira these activities can involve a number of risks and challenges including 

• complexity time and costs associated with managing these transactions including the integration of acquired and the winding down of divested business operations workforce products it systems and technologies 

• challenges in retaining customers of acquired businesses or providing the same level of service to existing customers with reduced resources 

• diversion of management time and attention 

• loss or termination of employees including costs associated with the termination or replacement of those employees 

• assumption of liabilities of the acquired and divested business or assets including pending or future litigation investigations or claims related to the acquired business or assets 

• the addition of acquisitionrelated debt 

• difficulty in entering into or expanding in new markets or geographies 

• increased or unexpected costs and working capital requirements 

• dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders 

• unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations 

• substantial accounting charges for acquisitionrelated costs asset impairments amortization of intangible assets and higher levels of stockbased compensation expense and 

• dif ficulty in realizing potential benefits including cost savings and operational efficiencies synergies and growth prospects from integrating acquired businesses 

moreover to be successful large complex acquisitions depend on largescale product technology and sales force integrations that are difficult to complete on a timely basis or at all and may be more susceptible to the special risks and challenges described above any of the foregoing and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability or other financial benefits from our acquired or divested businesses product lines or assets or to realize other anticipated benefits of divestitures or acquisitions 

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuance of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairments 

in response to changes in industry structure and market conditions we may be required to strategically reallocate our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting certain businesses any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions although in certain instances our vendor agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel reschedule or adjust with suppliers 

further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to evaluate goodwill impairment on an annual basis and between annual evaluations in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment evaluations may result in a charge to earnings 

risks related to our operations 

we are dependent upon broadcom for certain engineering and threat response services which are critical to our products and business 

our endpoint security solution has historically relied upon certain threat analytics software engines and other software the enginerelated services that have been developed and provided by engineering teams that have transferred to broadcom as part of the broadcom sale the technology including source code at issue is shared and pursuant to the terms of the broadcom sale we retain rights to use modify enhance and create derivative works from such technology broadcom has committed to provide these enginerelated services substantially to the same extent and in substantially the same manner as has been historically provided under a license agreement with a limited term 

table of conten ts 

as a result we are dependent on broadcom for services and technology that are critical to our norton business and if broadcom fails to deliver these enginerelated services it would result in significant business disruption and our business and operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected furthermore if our current sources become unavailable and if we are unable to develop or obtain alternatives to integrate or deploy them in time our ability to compete effectively could be impacted and have a material adverse effect on our business additionally in connection with the broadcom sale we lost other capabilities including certain threat intelligence data which were historically provided by our former enterprise security business the lack of which could have a negative impact on our business and products 

our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace 

our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key management technical including cyber security experts sales marketing ecommerce finance and other personnel our officers and other key personnel are “at will” employees and we generally do not have employment or noncompete agreements with our employees competition for people with the specific skills that we require is significant while we continue to monitor the competitive environment it is possible that the covid19 pandemic may affect the productivity of our employees and our ability to attract and retain key talent as a result of the pandemic in march 2020 we transitioned to a remote working environment for the substantial majority of our employees while our employees have transitioned effectively to working from home over time such remote operations may decrease the cohesiveness of our employees and our ability to maintain our culture both of which are integral to our success additionally a remote working environment may impede our ability to undertake new business projects to foster a creative environment to hire new employees and to retain existing employees 

in order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace we must provide competitive pay packages including cash and equitybased compensation additionally changes in immigration laws could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees if we fail to attract retain and motivate new or existing personnel our business results of operations and future growth prospects could suffer the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees in addition we may not have an adequate number of shares reserved under our equity compensation plans forcing us to reduce awards of equitybased compensation which could impair our efforts to attract retain and motivate necessary personnel if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees or conversely if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution from time to time key personnel leave our company and the frequency and number of such departures have widely varied and have in the past resulted in significant changes to our executive leadership team the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives our internal control over financial reporting and our results of operations in addition hiring training and successfully integrating replacement personnel can be time consuming and expensive may cause additional disruptions to our operations and may be unsuccessful which could negatively impact future financial results 

our inability to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity event could impair our ability to deliver our products and services and harm our business 

we are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure to provide our products and services to our customers for example we host many of our products using thirdparty data center facilities and while we require them to maintain formal service level agreements around availability we do not control the operation of these facilities these facilities are vulnerable to damage interruption or performance problems from earthquakes hurricanes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures pandemics and similar events they are also subject to breakins computer viruses sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct the occurrence of a natural disaster an act of terrorism a pandemic and similar events could result in a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems which in turn could result in lengthy interruptions in the delivery of our products and services which could negatively impact our sales and operating results 

furthermore our business administration human resources compliance efforts and finance services depend on the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations a disruption or failure of these systems or operations because of a disaster cyberattack or other business continuity event such as the covid19 pandemic could cause data to be lost or otherwise delay our ability to complete sales and provide the highest level of service to our customers in addition we could have difficulty producing accurate financial statements on a timely basis and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting which may impact our ability to certify our financial results all of which could adversely affect the trading value of our stock although we endeavor to ensure there is redundancy in these systems and that they are regularly backedup there are no assurances that data recovery in the event of a disaster would be effective or occur in an efficient manner   if these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions 

if we fail to offer highquality customer support our customer satisfaction may suffer and have a negative impact on our business and reputation 

many of our customers rely on our customer support services to resolve issues including technical support billing and subscription issues that may arise if demand increases or our resources decrease we may be unable to offer the level of support our customers expect any failure by us to maintain the expected level of support could reduce customer satisfaction and negatively impact our customer retention and our business

our international operations involve risks that could increase our expenses adversely affect our operating results and require increased time and attention of our management 

we derive a portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the us and we have significant operations outside of the us including engineering finance sales and customer support our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations including   

• potential loss of proprietary information due to misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us laws or that may not be adequately enforced 

• requirements of foreign laws and other governmental controls including tariffs trade barriers and labor restrictions and related laws that reduce the flexibility of our business operations 

• potential changes in trade relations arising from policy initiatives or other political factors 

• regulations or restrictions on the use import or export of encryption technologies that could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communications 

• local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulations 

• central bank and other restrictions on our ability to repatriate cash from our international subsidiaries or to exchange cash in international subsidiaries into cash available for use in the us 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates economic instability and inflationary conditions could make our solutions more expensive or could increase our costs of doing business in certain countries 

• limitations on future growth or inability to maintain current levels of revenues from international sales if we do not invest sufficiently in our international operations 

• difficulties in staffing managing and operating our international operations 

• difficulties in coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations 

• costs and delays associated with developing software and providing support in multiple languages and 

• political unrest war or terrorism or regional natural disasters particularly in areas in which we have facilities 

risks related to our solutions 

our solutions systems websites and the data on these sources may be subject to intentional disruption that could materially harm to our reputation and future sales 

despite our precautions and significant ongoing investments to protect against security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and other intentional disruptions of our solutions we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance and availability of our offerings and harm our reputation as a leading cyber security company similarly experienced computer programmers or other sophisticated individuals or entities including malicious hackers statesponsored organizations and insider threats including actions by employees and thirdparty service providers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our systems and websites and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our products and services such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication and if successful could expose us and the affected parties to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of our business operations 

while we engage in a number of measures aimed to protect against security breaches and to minimize the impact if a data breach were to occur our information technology systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage compromise disruption and shutdown due to attacks or breaches by hackers or other circumstances such as error or malfeasance by employees or third party service providers or technology malfunction the occurrence of any of these events as well as a failure to promptly remedy these events should they occur could compromise our systems and the information stored in our systems could be accessed publicly disclosed lost stolen or damaged any such circumstance could adversely affect our ability to attract and maintain customers as well as strategic partners cause us to suffer negative publicity or damage to our brand and subject us to legal claims and liabilities or regulatory penalties in addition unauthorized parties might alter information in our databases which would adversely affect both the reliability of that information and our ability to market and perform our services as well as undermine our ability to remain compliant with relevant laws and regulations techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently are constantly evolving and generally are difficult to recognize and react to effectively we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive or reactive measures several recent highly publicized data security breaches including a largescale attack on solarwinds customers by a foreign nation state actor and a significant uptick in ransomwareextortion attacks at other companies have heightened consumer awareness of this issue and may embolden individuals or groups to target our systems or those of our strategic partners or enterprise customers in december 2021 a critical remote code execution rce vulnerability was identified in the apache software foundation’s log4j software library log4j which if exploited could result in unauthorized access to company systems and data and acquisition of the same we are taking and have taken steps to remediate all known log4j vulnerabilities within our environment deployed compensating controls and implemented additional changes to protect against an exploit of those vulnerabilities a threat actor could exploit a log4j vulnerability or newly discovered vulnerabilities before we complete our remediation work or identify a vulnerability that we did not effectively remediate if that happens there could be unauthorized 

table of conten ts 

access to or acquisition of data we maintain and damage to company systems we could also face legal action from individuals business partners and regulators in connection with exploitation of those vulnerabilities which would result in increased costs and fees incurred in our defense against those proceedings 

our solutions are complex and operate in a wide variety of environments systems and configurations which could result in failures of our solutions to function as designed 

because we offer very complex solutions errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our solutions may and have occurred for example we may experience disruptions outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors including infrastructure changes human or software errors capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our websites simultaneously fraud or security attacks in some instances we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time interruptions in our solutions could impact our revenues or cause customers to cease doing business with us our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we could potentially lose customer data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of solutions to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario 

negative publicity regarding our brand solutions and business could harm our competitive position 

our brand recognition and reputation as a trusted service provider are critical aspects of our business and key to retaining existing customers and attracting new customers our business could be harmed due to errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our solutions causing our customers and potential customers to believe our solutions are unreliable furthermore negative publicity whether or not justified including intentional brand misappropriation relating to events or activities attributed to us our employees our strategic partners our affiliates or others associated with any of these parties may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands in addition the rapid rise and use of social media has the potential to harm our brand and reputation we may be unable to timely respond to and resolve negative and inaccurate social media posts regarding our company solutions and business in an appropriate manner damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our solutions and have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover any attempts to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands may be costly and time consuming and such efforts may not ultimately be successful 

we collect use disclose store or otherwise process personal information which subjects us to privacy and data security laws and contractual commitments 

we collect use process store transmit or disclose collectively process an increasingly large amount of confidential information including personally identifiable information credit card information and other critical data from employees and customers in connection with the operation of our business particularly in relation to our identity and information protection offerings 

the personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal state local and foreign laws regarding privacy and data security as well as contractual commitments any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions fines litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business 

additionally changes to applicable privacy or data security laws could impact how we process personal information and therefore limit the effectiveness of our solutions or our ability to develop new solutions for example the european union general data protection regulation imposes more stringent data protection requirements and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of €20 million or four percent of our worldwide annual revenues 

data protection legislation is also becoming increasingly common in the us at both the federal and state level for example the california consumer privacy act of 2018 the ccpa requires among other things covered companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers regarding the use of personal information gives california residents expanded rights to access their personal information that has been collected and allows such consumers new abilities to optout of certain sales of personal information further the new california privacy rights act the cpra significantly modifies the ccpa these modifications may result in additional uncertainty and require us to incur additional costs and expenses in our effort to comply additionally the federal trade commission the ftc and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection use dissemination and security of data the burdens imposed by the ccpa cpra and other similar laws that may be enacted at the federal and state level may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies adapt our goods and services and incur substantial expenditures in order to comply 

global privacy and data protection legislation enforcement and policy activity are rapidly expanding and evolving and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction we may be or become subject to data localization laws mandating that data collected in a foreign country be processed and stored only within that country if any country in which we have customers were to adopt a data localization law we could be required to expand our data storage facilities there or build new ones in order to comply the expenditure this would require as well as costs of compliance generally could harm our financial condition 

table of conten ts 

additionally third parties with whom we work such as vendors or developers may violate applicable laws or our policies and such violations can place personal information of our customers at risk in addition our customers may also accidentally disclose their passwords or store them on a device that is lost or stolen creating the perception that our systems are not secure against thirdparty access this could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business in addition such third parties could expose us to compromised data or technology or be the target of cyberattack and other data breaches which could impact our systems or our customers’ records further we could be the target of a cyberattack or other action that impacts our systems and results in a data breach of our customers’ records this could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business 

legal and compliance risks 

matters relating to or arising from our completed audit committee investigation including litigation matters and potential additional expenses may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

as previously disclosed in our public filings the audit committee completed its internal investigation in september 2018 in connection with the audit committee investigation we voluntarily selfreported to the sec the sec commenced a formal investigation with which we cooperated in april 2022 the sec staff informed the company that it concluded its investigation and does not intend to recommend an enforcement action by the commission against us 

we have incurred and may continue to incur significant expenses related to legal and other professional services in connection with or relating to the sec investigation which may continue to adversely affect our business and financial condition in addition securities class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against us certain current and former directors and former officers the outcome of the securities class actions and other litigation is difficult to predict and the cost to defend settle or otherwise resolve these matters may be significant plaintiffs in these matters may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts the monetary and other impact of these litigations proceedings or actions may remain unknown for substantial periods of time further an unfavorable resolution of litigations proceedings or actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and cash flows any future investigations or additional lawsuits may also adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our solutions are highly regulated which could impede our ability to market and provide our solutions or adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

our solutions are subject to a high degree of regulation including a wide variety of federal state and local laws and regulations such as the fair credit reporting act the grammleachbliley act the federal trade commission act ftc act and comparable state laws that are patterned after the ftc act lifelock has previously entered into consent decrees and similar arrangements with the ftc and the attorney generals of 35 states as well as a settlement with the ftc relating to allegations that certain of lifelock’s advertising marketing and security practices constituted deceptive acts or practices in violation of the ftc act which impose additional restrictions on our business including prohibitions against making any misrepresentation of “the means methods procedures effects effectiveness coverage or scope of” our solutions nortonlifelock signed an undertaking effective june 14 2021 with the united kingdom’s competition and markets authority cma requiring nortonlifelock to make certain changes to its policies and practices related to automatically renewing subscriptions in the united kingdom as part of the cma’s investigation into autorenewal practices in the antivirus sector it launched in december 2018 any of the laws and regulations that apply to our business are subject to revision or new or changed interpretations and we cannot predict the impact of such changes on our business 

additionally the nature of our identity and information protection products subjects us to the broad regulatory supervisory and enforcement powers of the consumer financial protection bureau which may exercise authority with respect to our services or the marketing and servicing of those services through the oversight of our financial institution or credit reporting agency customers and suppliers or by otherwise exercising its supervisory regulatory or enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services 

if we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology our financial results could be harmed 

much of our software and underlying technology is proprietary we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws however these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties third parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise obtain use distribute and sell our proprietary information without authorization 

third parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently by designing around our patents our consumer agreements do not require a signature and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions furthermore the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the us and we may be subject to the unauthorized use of our products in those countries the unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could adversely affect our ability to access software operating system and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor or cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products to their customers in addition any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in could be costly may distract management from daytoday operations and may lead to additional claims against us which could adversely affect our operating results 

table of conten ts 

from time to time we are a party to lawsuits and investigations which typically require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses 

we are frequently involved in litigation and other proceedings including but not limited to patent litigation class actions and governmental claims or investigations some of which may be material initially or become material over time the expense of initiating and defending and in some cases settling such matters may be costly and divert management’s attention from the daytoday operations of our business which could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows in addition such matters may thru the course of litigation or other proceedings incur an unfavorable change which could alter the profile of the matter and create potential material risk to the company any unfavorable outcome in a matter could result in significant fines settlements monetary damages or injunctive relief that could negatively and materially impact our ability to conduct our business results of operations and cash flows additionally in the event we did not previously accrue for such litigation or proceeding in our financial statements we may be required to record retrospective accruals that adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

from time to time third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights including claims regarding patents copyrights and trademarks because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that the number of these claims may grow in addition former employers of our former current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us confidential or proprietary information of these former employers any such claim with or without merit could result in costly litigation and distract management from daytoday operations if we are not successful in defending such claims we could be required to stop selling delay shipments of or redesign our solutions pay monetary amounts as damages enter into royalty or licensing arrangements or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our partners we cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to investigate defend and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

in addition we license and use software from third parties in our business these thirdparty software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and may expose us to additional liability this liability or our inability to use any of this thirdparty software could result in delivery delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

some of our products contain “open source” software and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business 

certain of our products are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under socalled “open source” licenses some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use by the terms of certain open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner in addition to risks related to license requirements usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software we have established processes to help alleviate these risks including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products in addition many of the risks associated with usage of open source may not or cannot be eliminated and could if not properly addressed negatively affect our business 

risks related to our liquidity and indebtedness 

there are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness that could adversely affect our financial condition 

as of april 1 2022 we had an aggregate of 3747 million of outstanding indebtedness that will mature in calendar years 2022 through 2030 and 1000 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information on our outstanding debt our ability to meet expenses remain in compliance with the covenants under our debt instruments pay interest and repay principal for our substantial level of indebtedness depends on among other things our operating performance competitive developments and financial market conditions all of which are significantly affected by financial business economic and other factors we are not able to control many of these factors accordingly our cash flow may not be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt including the notes and meet our other obligations our level of indebtedness could have other important consequences including the following  

• we must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on the term loans and revolving credit facility our existing senior notes and other indebtedness which reduces funds available to us for other purposes such as working capital capital expenditures other general corporate purposes and potential acquisitions 

table of conten ts 

• we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness or to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or general corporate purposes 

• we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates because borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities bear interest at variable rates 

• our leverage may be greater than that of some of our competitors which may put us at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our flexibility in responding to current and changing industry and financial market conditions 

• we may be more vulnerable to an economic downturn or recession and adverse developments in our business 

• we may be unable to comply with financial and other covenants in our debt agreements which could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived may result in acceleration of certain of our debt and would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects and could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation 

• changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of our debt andor our common stock adversely affect our access to debt markets and increase the interest we pay on outstanding or future debt and 

• conversion of our convertible note could result in significant dilution of our common stock which could result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully in addition we conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries accordingly repayment of our indebtedness will be dependent in part on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise which may not always be possible in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make the required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

the elimination of libor after june 2023 may affect our financial results 

all libor tenors relevant to us will cease to be published or will no longer be representative after june 30 2023 this means that any of our liborbased borrowings that extend beyond june 30 2023 will need to be converted to a replacement rate in the us the alternative reference rates committee a committee of private sector entities convened by the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york has recommended the secured overnight financing rate sofr plus a recommended spread adjustment as libors replacement there are significant differences between libor and sofr such as libor being an unsecured lending rate while sofr is a secured lending rate and sofr is an overnight rate while libor reflects term rates at different maturities if our liborbased borrowings are converted to sofr the differences between libor and sofr plus the recommended spread adjustment could result in interest costs that are higher than if libor remained available which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results although sofr is the arrcs recommended replacement rate it is also possible that lenders may instead choose alternative replacement rates that may differ from libor in ways similar to sofr or in other ways that would result in higher interest costs for us it is not yet possible to predict the magnitude of libors end on our borrowing costs given the remaining uncertainty about which rates will replace libor 

our term loan and revolving credit facility agreement impose operating and financial restrictions on us 

our term loan and revolving credit facility agreement contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to 

• incur additional debt 

• create liens on certain assets to secure debt 

• enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions 

• pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments and 

• consolidate merge sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets 

all of these covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance our operations meet or otherwise address our capital needs pursue business opportunities react to market conditions or otherwise restrict activities or business plans a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness if a default occurs the relevant lenders could elect to declare the indebtedness together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable and to the extent such indebtedness is secured in the future proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness 

general risks 

fluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected the trading price of our outstanding securities in the past and could affect the trading price of our outstanding securities in the future 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary in the future due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts and investors the trading price of our outstanding securities could be negatively affected volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions 

table of conten ts 

factors associated with our industry the operation of our business and the markets for our solutions may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate including but not limited to 

• fluctuations in demand for our solutions 

• disruptions in our business operations or target markets caused by among other things terrorism or other intentional acts outbreaks of disease such as the covid19 pandemic or earthquakes floods or other natural disasters 

• entry of new competition into our markets 

• our ability to achieve targeted operating income and margins and revenues 

• competitive pricing pressure or free offerings that compete with one or more of our solutions 

• our ability to timely complete the release of new or enhanced versions of our solutions 

• the amount and timing of commencement and termination of major marketing campaigns 

• the number severity and timing of threat outbreaks and cyber security incidents 

• loss of customers or strategic partners 

• changes in the mix or type of solutions and subscriptions sold and changes in consumer retention rates 

• the rate of adoption of new technologies and new releases of operating systems and new business processes 

• consumer confidence and spending changes 

• the impact of litigation regulatory inquiries or investigations 

• the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and our ability to achieve expected synergies or attendant cost savings 

• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

• the publication of unfavorable or inaccurate research reports about our business by cybersecurity industry analysts 

• the success of our corporate responsibility initiatives 

• changes in tax laws rules and regulations and 

• changes in consumer protection laws and regulations 

any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of our outstanding securities to fluctuate significantly 

changes to our effective tax rate could increase our income tax expense and reduce increase our net income loss cash flows and working capital 

our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

• changes to the us federal income tax laws including the potential for federal tax law changes put forward by congress and the biden administration including potentially increased corporate tax rates new minimum taxes and other changes to the way that our us tax liability has been calculated following the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act certain of these proposals could have significant retroactive adjustments adding cash tax paymentsliabilities if adopted 

• changes to other tax laws regulations and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate including actions resulting from the organisation for economic cooperation and developments oecd base erosion and profit shifting project including recent proposals for a global minimum tax rate proposed actions by international bodies such as digital services taxation as well as the requirements of certain tax rulings in october 2021 the oecdg20 inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting the inclusive framework published a statement updating and finalizing the key components of a twopillar plan on global tax reform which has now been agreed upon by the majority of oecd members pillar one allows countries to reallocate a portion of residual profits earned by multinational enterprises mne with an annual global turnover exceeding €20 billion and a profit margin over 10 to other market jurisdictions pillar two requires mnes with an annual global turnover exceeding €750 million to pay a global minimum tax of 15 additional guidance is expected to be published in 2022 we will continue to monitor the implementation of the inclusive framework agreement by the countries in which we operate we are unable to predict if and how these legislative changes will be enacted into law and it is possible that they could have a material effect on our corporate tax liability and our global effective tax rate 

• changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates 

• the tax effects of significant infrequently occurring events that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods 

• tax assessments or any related tax interest or penalties that could significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in which the settlements take place and 

• taxes arising in connection to changes in our workforce corporate entity structure or operations as they relate to tax incentives and tax rates 

table of conten ts 

from time to time we receive notices that a tax authority in a particular jurisdiction believes that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority we are regularly engaged in discussions and sometimes disputes with these tax authorities if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected

covid19 update 

  the covid19 pandemic has had widespread rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts on global society economies financial markets and business practices at the onset of the pandemic to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees partners and thirdparty service providers we facilitated a workfromhome requirement for most employees and established sitespecific covid19 prevention protocols we continue to monitor the situation and over the past several months have adjusted our policies and protocols to reflect changes to public health regulations and guidance a majority of our offices are now open to employees on a voluntary return basis and we anticipate opening the remaining offices on a voluntary return basis within the first quarter of fiscal 2023 to date we have not seen any meaningful negative impact on our employee productivity nevertheless as more employees partners or thirdparty services providers return to work during the covid19 pandemic the risk of inadvertent transmission of covid19 through human contact could still occur and result in litigation 

while the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted many sectors of the us and global economies the consumer cyber safety market experienced increased demand as the pandemic greatly accelerated the digital lives of people around the world however with the extended duration of the pandemic and the easing of prevention protocols and restrictions we are seeing decreasing demand and increased competition in addition while we did not experience a material increase in cancellations by customers or a material reduction in retention rate in fiscal 2021 or fiscal 2022 should the negative macroeconomic impacts of the covid19 pandemic persist or worsen we may experience continued slowdowns in our business activity and an increase in cancellations by customers or a material reduction in our retention rate in the future especially in the event of a prolonged recession a prolonged recession could adversely affect demand for our offerings retention rates and harm our business and results of operations particularly in light of the fact that our solutions are discretionary purchases and thus may be more susceptible to macroeconomic pressures as well impact the value of our common stock ability to refinance our debt and our access to capital 

the duration and extent of the impact from the covid19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately forecasted at this time such as the severity and transmission rate of new variants of the disease the extent effectiveness and acceptance of containment actions such as vaccination programs and the impact of these and other factors on our employees customers partners and thirdparty service providers for more information on the risks associated with the covid19 pandemic please see “risk factors” in item 1a 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap requires us to make estimates including judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1 and a description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and the company’s expectations of the impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures is included in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

business combinations 

we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of purchase price requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in determining the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets 

critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships developed technology trade names and acquired patents and discount rates management estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable thirdparty valuation specialists are also utilized for certain estimates unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

income taxes 

we are subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions we are required to estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess the temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes we apply judgment in the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes which includes the following critical accounting estimates 

table of conten ts 

we use a twostep process to recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any if we determine that the tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of various outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period 

loss contingencies 

we are subject to contingencies that expose us to losses including various legal and regulatory proceedings asserted and potential claims that arise in the ordinary course of business an estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and we may revise our estimates until the final resolution of such matters there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for that reporting period 

results of operations 

we have elected to omit discussion on the earliest of the three years presented in the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10k refer to part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended april 2 2021 for yearoveryear comparisons of the results of operation between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 as well as discussion of fiscal 2020 performance metrics and cash flow activity all of which are incorporated herein by reference 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 





note the percentages may not add due to rounding 

net revenues 



fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 

net revenues increased 245 million primarily due to a 156 million increase in sales of our consumer security products and a 89 million increase in sales of our identity and protection products this was driven by the increase in our direct customer count yearoveryear and revenue attributable to avira which was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 

table of conten ts 

performance metrics 

we regularly monitor a number of metrics in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance our metrics may be calculated in a manner different than similar metrics used by other companies 

the following table summarizes supplemental key performance metrics for our solutions 





1 direct customer revenues in fiscal 2022 and 2021 excludes a 11 million and 5 million respectively reduction of revenue from a contract liability purchase accounting adjustment which was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we believe that eliminating the impact of this adjustment improves the comparability of revenues between periods in addition although the adjustment amounts will never be recognized in our gaap financial statements we do not expect the acquisitions to affect the future renewal rates of revenues excluded by the adjustments 

2 the average direct customer count for the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2021 was prorated to include 16 million customers from the avira acquisition 

we define direct customer revenues as revenues from sales of our consumer solutions to direct customers which we define as active paid users who have a direct billing relationship with us at the end of the reported period we exclude users on free trials and promotions and users who have indirectly purchased our product or services through partners unless such users convert or renew their subscriptions directly with us or sign up for a paid membership through our web store 

from time to time we update our methodology due to changes in the business in fiscal 2021 the average direct customer count calculation was refined primarily to prorate for acquisitions that happen during a quarter such as avira which was acquired in january 2021 the full year average direct customer count is calculated as an average across the quarters 

arpu is calculated as estimated direct customer revenues for the period divided by the average direct customer count for the same period expressed as a monthly figure we monitor arpu because it helps us understand the rate at which we are monetizing our consumer customer base 

annual retention rate is defined as the number of direct customers who have more than a oneyear tenure as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal period divided by the total number of direct customers as of the end of the period from one year ago we monitor annual retention rate to evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies to improve renewals of subscriptions 

net revenues by geographic region 

percentage of revenue by geographic region as presented below is based on the billing location of the customer 



the americas include us canada and latin america emea includes europe middle east and africa apj includes asia pacific and japan 

percentage of revenue by geographic region remained consistent in fiscal 2022 and 2021 

cost of revenues 



fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 

our cost of revenues increased 46 million primarily due to higher revenue share costs payment processing fees and technical support costs associated with yearoveryear business growth and costs attributable to avira which was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 

table of conten ts 

operating expenses 



fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 

sales and marketing expense increased 46 million primarily due to a 70 million increase in advertising and promotional expenses as a result of increased investment in advertising this is partially offset by a 20 million decrease in it and related support costs from corporate restructuring and cost reduction efforts in fiscal 2021 

research and development expense decreased 14 million primarily due to a 13 million decrease in shared facility and it costs 

general and administrative expense increased 177 million primarily due to a 185 million legal accrual relating to an ongoing patent infringement lawsuit partially offset by a decrease in compensation and benefits 

amortization of intangible assets increased 11 million as a result of the avira acquisition 

restructuring and other costs decreased 130 million in connection with the november 2019 plan which was substantially completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details of the fiscal 2022 restructuring activities

nonoperating income expense net increased 61 million primarily due to a 175 million gain on the sale of certain land and buildings in mountain view california during fiscal 2022 compared to an aggregate 98 million gain on the sale of two properties during fiscal 2021 this is partially offset by the absence of a 20 million gain on early extinguishment of debt during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as well as a 7 million impairment of longterm assets primarily associated with one of our equity investments which is measured at cost minus impairment 

provision for income taxes 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and international tax jurisdictions our results of operations would be adversely affected to the extent that our geographical mix of income becomes more weighted toward jurisdictions with higher tax rates and would be favorably affected to the extent the relative geographic mix shifts to lower tax jurisdictions any change in our mix of earnings is dependent upon many factors and is therefore difficult to predict 



fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 

our effective tax rate is consistent with prior year

discontinued operations 

fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 

income loss from discontinued operations net of tax decreased primarily due to the completion of the discontinued operations activities in fiscal 2021 there was no discontinued operations activity during the year ended april 1 2022 

liquidity capital resources and cash requirements 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically relied on cash generated from operations borrowings under credit facilities issuances of debt and proceeds from divestitures for our liquidity needs 

our capital allocation strategy is to balance driving stockholder returns managing financial risk and preserving our flexibility to pursue strategic options including acquisitions and mergers historically this has included a quarterly cash dividend the repayment of debt and the repurchase of our common stock 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flow activities in fiscal 2022 and 2021 



cash from operating activities 

our cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal 2022 increased 268 million primarily due to higher profit before taxes adjusted by noncash items compared to fiscal 2021 

cash from investing activities 

our cash flows provided by investing activities in fiscal 2022 increased 395 million primarily due to higher proceeds from the sale of properties and fewer payments for business acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from the maturities and sales of shortterm investments 

cash from financing activities 

our cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2022 decreased 1570 million primarily due to a decrease in repayments of debt and no repurchases of common stock fiscal 2022 reflects the settlement of our new 25 convertible notes of 364 million and partial settlement of our new 20 convertible notes of 139 million compared to the settlement of our 20 convertible notes and repayment of our 42 senior notes of 1941 million as well as repurchases of common stock of 304 million during fiscal 2021 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of april 1 2022 we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of approximately 1891 million of which 671 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are managed with the objective to preserve principal maintain liquidity and generate investment returns the participation exemption system under current us federal tax regulations generally allows us to make distributions of nonus earnings to the us without incurring additional us federal tax however these distributions may be subject to applicable state or nonus taxes

dividends 

on may 5 2022 we announced a cash dividend of 0125 per share of common stock to be paid in june 2022 we currently expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends to stockholders in the future but such payments will be subject to the approval of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition results of operations capital requirements general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities 

share repurchase program 

under our stock repurchase program we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through accelerated stock repurchase transactions open market transactions including through trading plans intended to qualify under rule 10b51 under the exchange act and privatelynegotiated transactions as of april 1 2022 the remaining balance of our stock repurchase authorization is 1774 million and does not have an expiration date we currently expect to repurchase shares in the future but the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities 

subsequent to april 1 2022 we executed repurchases of 4 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate amount of 107 million as a result we have 1667 million remaining under our existing share repurchase program

contractual obligations 

the following is a schedule of our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of april 1 2022 the expected timing and amount of shortterm and longterm payments of the obligations in the following table is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for certain obligations 





1 as of april 1 2022 our total outstanding principal amount of indebtedness is comprised of 1713 million in term loans 1500 million in senior notes 525 million in convertible senior notes and 9 million in mortgage loans see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information about our debt and debt covenants 

the credit agreement we entered into in november 2019 which was amended and extended through may 2026 on may 7 2021 contains customary representations and warranties nonfinancial covenants for financial reporting affirmative and negative covenants including a covenant that we maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 525 to 10 or 575 to 10 if we acquire assets or business in an aggregate amount greater than 250 million and restrictions on indebtedness liens investments stock repurchases and dividends with exceptions permitting our regular quarterly dividend and other specific capital returns as of april 1 2022  we were in compliance with all debt covenants 

2 interest payments calculated based on the contractual terms of the related senior notes convertible senior notes and credit facility interest on variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate in effect as of april 1 2022 see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information on the senior notes convertible senior notes and term loans 

3 agreements for purchases of goods or services with terms that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction these amounts include agreements to purchase goods or services that have cancellation provisions requiring little or no payment the amounts under such contracts are included because management believes that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely and we expect to make future cash payments according to the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials 

4 transition tax payments on previously untaxed foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries under the tax cuts and jobs act which may be paid through july 2025 

5 payments for various noncancelable operating lease agreements that expire on various dates through fiscal 2029 the amounts in the table above exclude expected sublease income see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information on leases 

due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits and other longterm taxes as of april 1 2022 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities therefore 556 million in longterm income taxes payable has been excluded from the contractual obligations table see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information 

under the terms of the proposed merger we expect to pay a purchase price for the avast shares ranging from 81 billion to 86 billion upon the completion of the transaction in midtolate calendar year 2022 in conjunction with the proposed merger we have secured debt under the interim facilities which will be available upon the close of the transaction if the proposed merger is completed our debt obligations will include principal and interest payments related to these credit facilities see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding this business combination and the related debt instruments 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and support ongoing business activities through at least the next 12 months and to satisfy our known longterm contractual obligations we plan to finance the cash consideration payable to avast primarily with borrowings under our definitive facilities we believe that our existing cash and cash to be generated by operations along with amounts available under the new credit facility will satisfy our longterm cash requirements for this transaction however our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those as of april 1 2022 depending on several factors including but not limited to economic conditions political climate the expansion of sales and marketing activities the costs to acquire or invest in businesses and the risks and uncertainties discussed in “risk factors” in item 1a

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies we do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

our shortterm investments and cash equivalents primarily consist of corporate bonds and certificate of deposits respectively a change in interest could have an adverse impact on their market value as of april 1 2022 the carrying value and fair value of our shortterm investments and cash equivalents was 4 million a hypothetical change in the yield curve of 100 basis points would not result in a significant reduction in fair value 

as of april 1 2022 we had 20 billion in aggregate principal amount of fixedrate senior notes and convertible debt outstanding with a carrying amount and a fair value of 20 billion based on level 2 inputs the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change since these notes bear interest at fixed rates financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates is limited to future refinancing of current debt obligations if these notes were refinanced at higher interest rates prior to maturity our total interest payments could increase by a material amount however this risk is mitigated by our strong cash position and expected future cash generated from operations which will be sufficient to satisfy this increase in obligation 

as of april 1 2022 we also had 17 billion outstanding debt with variable interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate libor a reasonably possible hypothetical adverse change of 200 basis points in libor would not result in a significant increase in interest expense on an annualized basis 

in addition we have a 1 billion revolving credit facility that if drawn bears interest at a variable rate based on libor and would be subject to the same risks associated with adverse changes in libor 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we conduct business in numerous currencies through our worldwide operations and our entities hold monetary assets or liabilities earn revenues or incur costs in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency primarily in euro japanese yen singapore dollar british pound and australian dollar in addition we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services we provide our cash flow results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities as a result we are exposed to foreign exchange gains or losses which impacts our operating results 

we have a foreign exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures manage these exposures and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our results of operations through which we enter into monthly foreign exchange forward contracts on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of the changes in foreign exchange rates the gains and losses on these foreign exchange contracts are recorded in other income expense net in the consolidated statements of operations 

as of april 1 2022 and april 2 2021 we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of 346 million and 338 million respectively to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposure with an insignificant fair value a hypothetical ten percent depreciation of foreign currency would not result in a significant reduction in fair value of our forward contracts this analysis disregards the possibilities that the rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area 

additional information with respect to our derivative instruments is included in note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k

seasonality 

as is typical for many consumer technology companies portions of our business are impacted by seasonality however we believe the net impact to our business is limited seasonal behavior in orders primarily reflects consumer spending patterns where our fiscal third and fourth quarters are higher due to the holidays in our third quarter as well as followon holiday purchases and the us tax filing season in our fourth quarter revenue generally reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than orders because of our subscription business model and because a large portion of our inperiod revenues are recognized ratably from our deferred revenue balance

industry overview  market opportunity 

cyber safety is a growing market fueled by the increase in activities online over the years as well as the years ahead the core markets that we participate in are security identity and privacy we believe the cyber safety market will continue to expand beyond these core markets and grow significantly – driven by the growing number of people connected to the internet who have a digital life 

the cyber threat landscape is larger and more complicated than ever before exposing consumers to an increased risk to their digital lives the digitization of the world and the overlap between the physical and digital world is growing at a fast pace new technologies smart devices digital identities and an increasingly more connected world means consumers will encounter a range of new cyber safety challenges consumer demands and behaviors are rapidly changing and driving more activities online from shopping socializing working banking to other activities in healthcare entertainment and so much more almost every aspect of a person’s life has a digital component unfortunately many of those activities are left unprotected and attackers are exploiting this larger opportunity and the inherent security and privacy vulnerabilities cyber criminals have not only expanded their reach but the sophistication of digital threats and attacks are becoming increasingly more consumerrelated 

cyber crime and the ways in which cyber criminals target consumers continue to evolve along with behaviors and technology cyber crime encompasses any crime committed digitally over the internet and includes crimes where i malicious software or unauthorized access is detected on a device network or online account such as email social media online banking online retail gaming online entertainment etc and unauthorized access or connection to cloud service accounts ii an individual is digitally victimized through a data breach cyber theft cyber extortion or fraud stolen personally identifiable information identity theft etc iii online stalking bullying or harassment is inflicted or iv attacks related to privacy or disinformation such as online tracking protection identity impersonation disinformation on social media deepfakes nontrustworthy wifis eviltwin attacks etc

 item 1a risk factors 

covid19 risks 

the covid19 pandemic has affected how we are operating our business and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain 

the covid19 pandemic is having widespread rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts on global society economies financial markets and business practices to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees partners and thirdparty service providers we have implemented a near companywide workfromhome requirement for most employees until further notice made substantial modifications to employee travel policies and cancelled or shifted our conferences and other marketing events to virtualonly for the foreseeable future we continue to monitor the situation and will adjust our current policies as recommendations and public health guidance changes to date we have not seen any meaningful negative impact on our customer success efforts sales and marketing efforts or employee productivity nevertheless as employees partners or thirdparty services providers return to work during the covid19 pandemic the risk of inadvertent transmission of covid19 through human contact could still occur and result in litigation 

the us and global economies have experienced a recession due to the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic although we did not experience a material increase in cancellations by customers or a material reduction in our retention rate in 2021 we may experience such an increase or reduction in the future especially in the event of a prolonged recession as a result of the covid19 pandemic a prolonged recession could adversely affect demand for our offerings retention rates and harm our business and results of operations particularly in light of the fact that our solutions are discretionary purchases and thus may be more susceptible to macroeconomic pressures as well impact the value of our common stock ability to refinance our debt and our access to capital 

the duration and extent of the impact from the covid19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately forecasted at this time such as the severity and transmission rate of new variants of the disease the extent effectiveness and acceptance of containment actions such as vaccination programs and the impact of these and other factors on our employees customers partners and thirdparty service providers if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively and if the macroeconomic conditions of the general economy or the industries in which we operate do not improve or deteriorate further our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

risks related to our business strategy and industry 

if we are unable to develop new and enhanced solutions or if we are unable to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our existing solutions our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our future success depends on our ability to effectively respond to evolving threats to consumers as well as competitive technological developments and industry changes by developing or introducing new and enhanced solutions on a timely basis we have in the past incurred and will continue to incur significant research and development expenses as we focus on organic growth through internal innovation we believe that we also must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to decrease our reliance on third parties if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected additionally we must continually address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends and competitive developments customers may require features and capabilities that our current solutions do not have our failure to develop 

table of contents 

new solutions and improve our existing solutions to satisfy customer preferences and effectively compete with other market offerings in a timely and costeffective manner may harm our ability to retain our customers and attract new customers a loss of customers would adversely impact our business and operating results 

the development and introduction of new solutions involve a significant commitment of time and resources and are subject to a number of risks and challenges including but not limited to 

• lengthy development cycles 

• evolving industry and regulatory standards and technological developments by our competitors and customers 

• rapidly changing customer preferences 

• evolving platforms operating systems and hardware products such as mobile devices 

• product and service interoperability challenges with customer’s technology and thirdparty vendors 

• entering into new or unproven markets and 

• executing new product and service strategies 

in addition third parties including operating systems and internet browser companies may take steps to limit the interoperability of our solutions with their own products and services in some cases to promote their own offerings this could delay the development of our solutions or our solutions may be unable to operate effectively this could also result in decreased demand for our solutions decreased revenue and harm to our reputation and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges or if our new or improved solutions are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

we operate in a highly competitive environment and our competitors may gain market share in the markets for our solutions 

we operate in intensely competitive markets that experience frequent technological developments changes in industry and regulatory standards changes in customer requirements and preferences and frequent new product introductions and improvements if we are unable to anticipate or react to these continually evolving conditions we could lose market share and experience a decline in our revenues to compete successfully we must maintain an innovative research and development effort to develop new solutions and enhance our existing solutions effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors as well as the ways our information is accessed used and stored by our customers and appropriately respond to competitive strategies 

our competitors include software vendors and operating system providers that offer solutions that directly compete with our offerings we face growing competition from other technology companies as well as from companies in the identity threat protection space such as credit bureaus many of our competitors are increasingly developing and incorporating into their products data protection software and other competing products often free of charge that compete at some level with our offerings our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our solutions we face additional risks that these products could limit the operability of our solutions for our customers some of our competitors have greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do and consequently may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their products instead of ours including through investing more in internal innovation than we can further consolidation within our industry or other changes in the competitive environment such as greater vertical integration from key computing and operating system suppliers could result in larger competitors that compete more directly with us we also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the market in which we compete 

in addition to competing with these vendors directly for sales to endusers of our solutions we compete with them for the opportunity to have our solutions bundled with the offerings of our strategic partners such as computer hardware original equipment manufacturers oems and internet service providers isps and operating systems our competitors could gain market share from us if any of these strategic partners replace our solutions with those of our competitors or if these partners more actively promote our competitors’ solutions than our own in addition software vendors who have bundled our solutions with theirs may choose to bundle their solutions with their own or other vendors’ solutions or may limit our access to standard interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop solutions for their platform in the future further product development by these vendors could cause our solutions to become redundant which could significantly impact our sales and operating results 

we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully 

the intense competition we face in addition to general and economic business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain solutions or provide offerings or offer free introductory products freemium products that compete with ours we may need to lower prices or offer similar freemium products in order to compete successfully similarly if external factors require us to raise our prices our ability to acquire new customers and retain existing customers may be diminished any such changes may reduce revenue and margins and could adversely affect our financial results 

additionally our business may be affected by changes in the macroeconomic environment our solutions are discretionary purchases and customers may reduce or eliminate their discretionary spending on our solutions during a difficult 

table of contents 

macroeconomic environment although we did not experience a material increase in cancellations by customers or a material reduction in our retention rate in fiscal 2021 we may experience such an increase or reduction in the future especially in the event of a prolonged recession or a worsening of current conditions as a result of the covid19 pandemic in addition during a recession consumers may experience a decline in their credit or disposable income which may result in less demand for our solutions as a result we may have to lower our prices or make other changes to our pricing model to address these dynamics any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

in addition in january 2021 we acquired germanybased avira many of avira’s users are freemium subscribers meaning they do not pay for its basic services much of our anticipated growth in connection with the avira acquisition is attributable to converting avira’s freemium users to a paid subscription option numerous factors however may impede our ability to retain and convert these users into paying customers 

if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively or if our partners choose not to market and sell our solutions to their customers our operating results could be adversely affected 

a portion of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels including but not limited to distributors that sell our products to endusers and other resellers and oem partners that incorporate our products into or bundle our products with their products these channels involve a number of risks including 

• our resellers distributors and oems are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our solutions to their customers 

• our reseller and distributor agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause and our oem partners may terminate or renegotiate their arrangements with us and new terms may be less favorable due to competitive conditions in our markets and other factors 

• our resellers distributors and oems may encounter issues or have violations of applicable law or regulatory requirements or otherwise cause damage to our reputation through their actions 

• our resellers and distributors frequently market and distribute competing solutions and may from time to time place greater emphasis on the sale of these competing solutions due to pricing promotions and other terms offered by our competitors 

• any consolidation of electronics retailers can increase their negotiating power with respect to software providers such as us and any decline in the number of physical retailers could decrease the channels of distribution for us 

• the continued consolidation of online sales through a small number of larger channels has been increasing which could reduce the channels available for online distribution of our solutions and 

• sales through our partners are subject to changes in general economic conditions strategic direction competitive risks and other issues that could result in a reduction of sales or cause our partners to suffer financial difficulty which could delay payments to us affecting our operating results 

if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels successfully these channels may conflict with one another or otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate which could reduce our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our competitive position 

our revenue and operating results depend significantly on our ability to retain our existing customers convert existing nonpaying customers to paying customers and add new customers 

we generally sell our solutions to our customers on a monthly or annual subscription basis customers may choose not to renew their membership with us at any time renewing customers may require additional incentives to renew may not renew for the same contract period or may change their subscriptions we therefore may be unable to retain our existing customers on the same or on more profitable terms if at all in addition we may not be able to accurately predict or anticipate future trends in customer retention or effectively respond to such trends 

our customer retention rates may decline or fluctuate due to a variety of factors including the following 

• our customers’ levels of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our solutions and the value they place on our solutions 

• the quality breadth and prices of our solutions 

• our general reputation and events impacting that reputation 

• the services and related pricing offered by our competitors 

• disruption by new services or changes in law or regulations that impact the need for efficacy or of our products and services 

• changes in autorenewal regulations 

• our customer service and responsiveness to the needs of our customers and 

• changes in our target customers’ spending levels as a result of general economic conditions or other factors 

declining customer retention rates could cause our revenue to may grow more slowly than expected or decline and our operating results gross margins and business will be harmed 

our acquisitions and divestitures create special risks and challenges that could adversely affect our financial results 

table of contents 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire or divest businesses or assets for example in 2019 we completed the sale of certain of our enterprise security assets to broadcom inc the “broadcom sale” and in january 2021 we completed the acquisition of avira these activities can involve a number of risks and challenges including 

• complexity time and costs associated with managing these transactions including the integration of acquired and the winding down of divested business operations workforce products it systems and technologies 

• challenges in retaining customers of acquired businesses or providing the same level of service to existing customers with reduced resources 

• diversion of management time and attention 

• loss or termination of employees including costs associated with the termination or replacement of those employees 

• assumption of liabilities of the acquired and divested business or assets including pending or future litigation investigations or claims related to the acquired business or assets 

• the addition of acquisitionrelated debt 

• difficulty in entering into or expanding in new markets or geographies 

• increased or unexpected costs and working capital requirements 

• dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders 

• unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations 

• substantial accounting charges for acquisitionrelated costs asset impairments amortization of intangible assets and higher levels of stockbased compensation expense and 

• dif ficulty in realizing potential benefits including cost savings and operational efficiencies synergies and growth prospects from integrating acquired businesses 

moreover to be successful large complex acquisitions depend on largescale product technology and sales force integrations that are difficult to complete on a timely basis or at all and may be more susceptible to the special risks and challenges described above any of the foregoing and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability or other financial benefits from our acquired or divested businesses product lines or assets or to realize other anticipated benefits of divestitures or acquisitions 

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuance of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairments 

in response to changes in industry structure and market conditions we may be required to strategically reallocate our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting certain businesses any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions although in certain instances our vendor agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel reschedule or adjust with suppliers 

further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to evaluate goodwill impairment on an annual basis and between annual evaluations in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment evaluations may result in a charge to earnings 

risks related to our operations 

we are dependent upon broadcom for certain engineering and threat response services which are critical to our products and business 

our endpoint security solution has historically relied upon certain threat analytics software engines and other software the enginerelated services that have been developed and provided by engineering teams that have transferred to broadcom as part of the broadcom sale the technology including source code at issue is shared and pursuant to the terms of the broadcom sale we retain rights to use modify enhance and create derivative works from such technology broadcom has committed to provide these enginerelated services substantially to the same extent and in substantially the same manner as has been historically provided under a license agreement with a limited term 

as a result we are dependent on broadcom for services and technology that are critical to our norton business and if broadcom fails to deliver these enginerelated services it would result in significant business disruption and our business and operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected furthermore if our current sources become unavailable and if we are unable to develop or obtain alternatives to integrate or deploy them in time our ability to compete effectively could be impacted and have a material adverse effect on our business additionally in connection with the broadcom sale we lost other capabilities including certain threat intelligence data which were historically provided by our former enterprise security business the lack of which could have a negative impact on our business and products 

our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace 

table of contents 

our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key management technical including cyber security experts sales marketing ecommerce finance and other personnel our officers and other key personnel are “at will” employees and we generally do not have employment or noncompete agreements with our employees competition for people with the specific skills that we require is significant while we continue to monitor the competitive environment it is possible that the covid19 pandemic may affect the productivity of our employees and our ability to attract and retain key talent as a result of the pandemic in march 2020 we transitioned to a remote working environment for the substantial majority of our employees while our employees have transitioned effectively to working from home over time such remote operations may decrease the cohesiveness of our employees and our ability to maintain our culture both of which are integral to our success additionally a remote working environment may impede our ability to undertake new business projects to foster a creative environment to hire new employees and to retain existing employees 

in order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace we must provide competitive pay packages including cash and equitybased compensation additionally changes in immigration laws could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees if we fail to attract retain and motivate new or existing personnel our business results of operations and future growth prospects could suffer the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees in addition we may not have an adequate number of shares reserved under our equity compensation plans forcing us to reduce awards of equitybased compensation which could impair our efforts to attract retain and motivate necessary personnel if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees or conversely if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution from time to time key personnel leave our company and the frequency and number of such departures have widely varied and have in the past resulted in significant changes to our executive leadership team the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives our internal control over financial reporting and our results of operations in addition hiring training and successfully integrating replacement personnel can be time consuming and expensive may cause additional disruptions to our operations and may be unsuccessful which could negatively impact future financial results 

our inability to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity event could impair our ability to deliver our products and services and harm our business 

we are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure to provide our products and services to our customers for example we host many of our products using thirdparty data center facilities and while we require them to maintain formal service level agreements around availability we do not control the operation of these facilities these facilities are vulnerable to damage interruption or performance problems from earthquakes hurricanes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures pandemics and similar events they are also subject to breakins computer viruses sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct the occurrence of a natural disaster an act of terrorism a pandemic and similar events could result in a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems which in turn could result in lengthy interruptions in the delivery of our products and services which could negatively impact our sales and operating results 

furthermore our business administration human resources compliance efforts and finance services depend on the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations a disruption or failure of these systems or operations because of a disaster cyberattack or other business continuity event such as the covid19 pandemic could cause data to be lost or otherwise delay our ability to complete sales and provide the highest level of service to our customers in addition we could have difficulty producing accurate financial statements on a timely basis and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting which may impact our ability to certify our financial results all of which could adversely affect the trading value of our stock although we endeavor to ensure there is redundancy in these systems and that they are regularly backedup there are no assurances that data recovery in the event of a disaster would be effective or occur in an efficient manner   if these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions 

if we fail to offer highquality customer support our customer satisfaction may suffer and have a negative impact our business and reputation 

many of our customers rely on our customer support services to resolve issues including technical support billing and subscription issues that may arise if demand increases or our resources decrease we may be unable to offer the level of support our customers expect any failure by us to maintain the expected level of support could reduce customer satisfaction and negatively impact our customer retention and our business 

our international operations involve risks that could increase our expenses adversely affect our operating results and require increased time and attention of our management 

we derive a portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the us and we have significant operations outside of the us including engineering finance sales and customer support our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations including   

• potential loss of proprietary information due to misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us laws or that may not be adequately enforced 

table of contents 

• requirements of foreign laws and other governmental controls including tariffs trade barriers and labor restrictions and related laws that reduce the flexibility of our business operations 

• potential changes in trade relations arising from policy initiatives or other political factors 

• regulations or restrictions on the use import or export of encryption technologies that could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communications 

• local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulations 

• central bank and other restrictions on our ability to repatriate cash from our international subsidiaries or to exchange cash in international subsidiaries into cash available for use in the us 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates economic instability and inflationary conditions could make our solutions more expensive or could increase our costs of doing business in certain countries 

• limitations on future growth or inability to maintain current levels of revenues from international sales if we do not invest sufficiently in our international operations 

• difficulties in staffing managing and operating our international operations 

• difficulties in coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations 

• costs and delays associated with developing software and providing support in multiple languages and 

• political unrest war or terrorism or regional natural disasters particularly in areas in which we have facilities 

risks related to our solutions 

our solutions systems websites and the data on these sources may be subject to intentional disruption that could materially harm to our reputation and future sales 

despite our precautions and significant ongoing investments to protect against security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and other intentional disruptions of our solutions we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance and availability of our offerings and harm our reputation as a leading cyber security company similarly experienced computer programmers or other sophisticated individuals or entities including malicious hackers statesponsored organizations and insider threats including actions by employees and thirdparty service providers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our systems and websites and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our products and services such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication and if successful could expose us and the affected parties to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of our business operations 

while we engage in a number of measures aimed to protect against security breaches and to minimize the impact if a data breach were to occur our information technology systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage compromise disruption and shutdown due to attacks or breaches by hackers or other circumstances such as error or malfeasance by employees or third party service providers or technology malfunction the occurrence of any of these events as well as a failure to promptly remedy these events should they occur could compromise our systems and the information stored in our systems could be accessed publicly disclosed lost stolen or damaged any such circumstance could adversely affect our ability to attract and maintain customers as well as strategic partners cause us to suffer negative publicity or damage to our brand and subject us to legal claims and liabilities or regulatory penalties in addition unauthorized parties might alter information in our databases which would adversely affect both the reliability of that information and our ability to market and perform our services as well as undermine our ability to remain compliant with relevant laws and regulations techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently are constantly evolving and generally are difficult to recognize and react to effectively we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive or reactive measures several recent highly publicized data security breaches including a largescale attack on solarwinds customers by a foreign nation state actor and a significant uptick in ransomwareextortion attacks at other companies have heightened consumer awareness of this issue and may embolden individuals or groups to target our systems or those of our strategic partners or enterprise customers 

our solutions are complex and operate in a wide variety of environments systems and configurations which could result in failures of our solutions to function as designed 

because we offer very complex solutions errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our solutions may and have occurred for example we may experience disruptions outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors including infrastructure changes human or software errors capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our websites simultaneously fraud or security attacks in some instances we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time interruptions in our solutions could impact our revenues or cause customers to cease doing business with us our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we could potentially lose customer data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of solutions to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario 

negative publicity regarding our brand solutions and business could harm our competitive position 

table of contents 

our brand recognition and reputation as a trusted service provider are critical aspects of our business and key to retaining existing customers and attracting new customers our business could be harmed due to errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our solutions causing our customers and potential customers to believe our solutions are unreliable furthermore negative publicity whether or not justified including intentional brand misappropriation relating to events or activities attributed to us our employees our strategic partners our affiliates or others associated with any of these parties may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands in addition the rapid rise and use of social media has the potential to harm our brand and reputation we may be unable to timely respond to and resolve negative and inaccurate social media posts regarding our company solutions and business in an appropriate manner damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our solutions and have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover any attempts to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands may be costly and time consuming and such efforts may not ultimately be successful 

we collect use disclose store or otherwise process personal information which subjects us to privacy and data security laws and contractual commitments 

we collect use process store transmit or disclose collectively process an increasingly large amount of confidential information including personally identifiable information credit card information and other critical data from employees and customers in connection with the operation of our business particularly in relation to our identity and information protection offerings 

the personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal state local and foreign laws regarding privacy and data security as well as contractual commitments any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions fines litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business 

additionally changes to applicable privacy or data security laws could impact how we process personal information and therefore limit the effectiveness of our solutions or our ability to develop new solutions for example the european union general data protection regulation imposes more stringent data protection requirements and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of €20 million or four percent of our worldwide annual revenues 

data protection legislation is also becoming increasingly common in the us at both the federal and state level for example the california consumer privacy act of 2018 the ccpa requires among other things covered companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers regarding the use of personal information gives california residents expanded rights to access their personal information that has been collected and allows such consumers new abilities to optout of certain sales of personal information further the new california privacy rights act the cpra significantly modifies the ccpa these modifications may result in additional uncertainty and require us to incur additional costs and expenses in our effort to comply additionally the federal trade commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection use dissemination and security of data the burdens imposed by the ccpa cpra and other similar laws that may be enacted at the federal and state level may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies adapt our goods and services and incur substantial expenditures in order to comply 

global privacy and data protection legislation enforcement and policy activity are rapidly expanding and evolving and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction we may be or become subject to data localization laws mandating that data collected in a foreign country be processed and stored only within that country if any country in which we have customers were to adopt a data localization law we could be required to expand our data storage facilities there or build new ones in order to comply the expenditure this would require as well as costs of compliance generally could harm our financial condition 

additionally third parties with whom we work such as vendors or developers may violate applicable laws or our policies and such violations can place personal information of our customers at risk in addition our customers may also accidentally disclose their passwords or store them on a device that is lost or stolen creating the perception that our systems are not secure against thirdparty access this could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business in addition such third parties could expose us to compromised data or technology or be the target of cyberattack and other data breaches which could impact our systems or our customers’ records further we could be the target of a cyberattack or other action that impacts our systems and results in a data breach of our customers’ records this could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business 

legal and compliance risks 

matters relating to or arising from our completed audit committee investigation including regulatory investigations and proceedings litigation matters and potential additional expenses may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

as previously disclosed in our public filings the audit committee completed its internal investigation in september 2018 in connection with the audit committee investigation we voluntarily selfreported to the sec the sec commenced a formal investigation and we continue to cooperate with that investigation the outcome of such an investigation is difficult to predict if the sec commences legal action we could be required to pay significant penalties and become subject to injunctions a cease and desist order and other equitable remedies we can provide no assurances as to the outcome of any governmental investigation 

we have incurred and may continue to incur significant expenses related to legal and other professional services in connection with the ongoing sec investigation which may continue to adversely affect our business and financial condition in 

table of contents 

addition securities class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against us certain current and former directors and former officers the outcome of the securities class actions and other litigation and regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions is difficult to predict and the cost to defend settle or otherwise resolve these matters may be significant plaintiffs or regulatory agencies or authorities in these matters may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts or seek to impose sanctions including significant monetary penalties the monetary and other impact of these litigations proceedings or actions may remain unknown for substantial periods of time further an unfavorable resolution of litigations proceedings or actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and cash flows any future investigations or additional lawsuits may also adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our solutions are highly regulated which could impede our ability to market and provide our solutions or adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

our solutions are subject to a high degree of regulation including a wide variety of federal state and local laws and regulations such as the fair credit reporting act the grammleachbliley act the federal trade commission act ftc act and comparable state laws that are patterned after the ftc act lifelock has previously entered into consent decrees and similar arrangements with the ftc and the attorney generals of 35 states as well as a settlement with the ftc relating to allegations that certain of lifelock’s advertising marketing and security practices constituted deceptive acts or practices in violation of the ftc act which impose additional restrictions on our business including prohibitions against making any misrepresentation of “the means methods procedures effects effectiveness coverage or scope of” our solutions any of the laws and regulations that apply to our business are subject to revision or new or changed interpretations and we cannot predict the impact of such changes on our business 

additionally the nature of our identity and information protection products subjects us to the broad regulatory supervisory and enforcement powers of the consumer financial protection bureau which may exercise authority with respect to our services or the marketing and servicing of those services through the oversight of our financial institution or credit reporting agency customers and suppliers or by otherwise exercising its supervisory regulatory or enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services 

if we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology our financial results could be harmed 

much of our software and underlying technology is proprietary we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws however these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties third parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise obtain use distribute and sell our proprietary information without authorization 

third parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently by designing around our patents our consumer agreements do not require a signature and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions furthermore the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the us and we may be subject to the unauthorized use of our products in those countries the unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could adversely affect our ability to access software operating system and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor or cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products to their customers in addition any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in could be costly may distract management from daytoday operations and may lead to additional claims against us which could adversely affect our operating results 

from time to time we are a party to lawsuits and investigations which typically require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses 

we have initiated and been named as a party to lawsuits including patent litigation class actions and governmental claims and we may be named in additional litigation the expense of initiating and defending and in some cases settling such litigation may be costly and divert management’s attention from the daytoday operations of our business which could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows in addition an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could result in significant fines settlements monetary damages or injunctive relief that could negatively and materially impact our ability to conduct our business results of operations and cash flows 

for example in december 2018 the united kingdom’s competition and markets authority cma launched an investigation into autorenewal practices in the antivirus sector and recently announced that nortonlifelock was one of the companies it was investigating we continue to cooperate with the cma in the course of its investigation and believe our business practices are fair and compliant with uk consumer law however we have been expending management time and resources on this matter and an unfavorable outcome of this investigation and any resulting litigation could impact our marketing practices to consumers and potentially damage our reputation and otherwise harm our business and financial results 

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

from time to time third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights including claims regarding patents copyrights and trademarks because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete the 

table of contents 

extensive patent coverage of existing technologies and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that the number of these claims may grow in addition former employers of our former current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us confidential or proprietary information of these former employers any such claim with or without merit could result in costly litigation and distract management from daytoday operations if we are not successful in defending such claims we could be required to stop selling delay shipments of or redesign our solutions pay monetary amounts as damages enter into royalty or licensing arrangements or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our partners we cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to investigate defend and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

in addition we license and use software from third parties in our business these thirdparty software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and may expose us to additional liability this liability or our inability to use any of this thirdparty software could result in delivery delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

some of our products contain “open source” software and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business 

certain of our products are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under socalled “open source” licenses some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use by the terms of certain open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner in addition to risks related to license requirements usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software we have established processes to help alleviate these risks including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products in addition many of the risks associated with usage of open source may not or cannot be eliminated and could if not properly addressed negatively affect our business 

risks related to our liquidity and indebtedness 

there are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness that could adversely affect our financial condition 

as of april 2 2021 we had an aggregate of 3620 million of outstanding indebtedness that will mature in calendar years 2022 through 2030 and 1000 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information on our outstanding debt our ability to meet expenses remain in compliance with the covenants under our debt instruments pay interest and repay principal for our substantial level of indebtedness depends on among other things our operating performance competitive developments and financial market conditions all of which are significantly affected by financial business economic and other factors we are not able to control many of these factors accordingly our cash flow may not be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt including the notes and meet our other obligations our level of indebtedness could have other important consequences including the following  

• we must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on the term loans and revolving credit facility our existing senior notes and other indebtedness which reduces funds available to us for other purposes such as working capital capital expenditures other general corporate purposes and potential acquisitions 

• we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness or to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or general corporate purposes 

• we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates because borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities bear interest at variable rates 

• our leverage may be greater than that of some of our competitors which may put us at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our flexibility in responding to current and changing industry and financial market conditions 

• we may be more vulnerable to an economic downturn or recession and adverse developments in our business 

• we may be unable to comply with financial and other covenants in our debt agreements which could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived may result in acceleration of certain of our debt and would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects and could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation 

• changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of our debt andor our common stock adversely affect our access to debt markets and increase the interest we pay on outstanding or future debt and 

• conversion of our convertible note could result in significant dilution of our common stock which could result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

table of contents 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully in addition we conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries accordingly repayment of our indebtedness will be dependent in part on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise which may not always be possible in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make the required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

the elimination of libor after june 2023 may affect our financial results 

on march 5 2021 the united kingdom financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that all libor tenors relevant to us will cease to be published or will no longer be representative after june 30 2023 this means that any of our liborbased borrowings that extend beyond june 30 2023 will need to be converted to a replacement rate in the us the alternative reference rates committee or arrc a committee of private sector entities with exofficio official sector members convened by the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york has recommended the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” plus a recommended spread adjustment as libors replacement there are significant differences between libor and sofr such as libor being an unsecured lending rate while sofr is a secured lending rate and sofr is an overnight rate while libor reflects term rates at different maturities if our liborbased borrowings are converted to sofr the differences between libor and sofr plus the recommended spread adjustment could result in interest costs that are higher than if libor remained available which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results although sofr is the arrcs recommended replacement rate it is also possible that lenders may instead choose alternative replacement rates that may differ from libor in ways similar to sofr or in other ways that would result in higher interest costs for us it is not yet possible to predict the magnitude of libors end on our borrowing costs given the remaining uncertainty about which rates will replace libor 

our term loan and revolving credit facility agreement impose operating and financial restrictions on us 

our term loan and revolving credit facility agreement contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to 

• incur additional debt 

• create liens on certain assets to secure debt 

• enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions 

• pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments and 

• consolidate merge sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets 

all of these covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance our operations meet or otherwise address our capital needs pursue business opportunities react to market conditions or otherwise restrict activities or business plans a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness if a default occurs the relevant lenders could elect to declare the indebtedness together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable and to the extent such indebtedness is secured in the future proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness 

general risks 

fluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected the trading price of our outstanding securities in the past and could affect the trading price of our outstanding securities in the future 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary in the future due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts and investors the trading price of our outstanding securities could be negatively affected volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions 

factors associated with our industry the operation of our business and the markets for our solutions may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate including but not limited to 

• fluctuations in demand for our solutions 

• disruptions in our business operations or target markets caused by among other things terrorism or other intentional acts outbreaks of disease such as the covid19 pandemic or earthquakes floods or other natural disasters 

• entry of new competition into our markets 

• our ability to achieve targeted operating income and margins and revenues 

• competitive pricing pressure or free offerings that compete with one or more of our solutions 

• our ability to timely complete the release of new or enhanced versions of our solutions 

• the amount and timing of commencement and termination of major marketing campaigns 

• the number severity and timing of threat outbreaks and cyber security incidents 

• loss of customers or strategic partners 

• changes in the mix or type of solutions and subscriptions sold and changes in consumer retention rates 

table of contents 

• the rate of adoption of new technologies and new releases of operating systems and new business processes 

• consumer confidence and spending changes 

• the impact of litigation regulatory inquiries or investigations 

• the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and our ability to achieve expected synergies or attendant cost savings 

• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

• the publication of unfavorable or inaccurate research reports about our business by cybersecurity industry analysts 

• the success of our corporate responsibility initiatives 

• changes in tax laws rules and regulations and 

• changes in consumer protection laws and regulations 

any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of our outstanding securities to fluctuate significantly 

changes to our effective tax rate could increase our income tax expense and reduce increase our net income loss cash flows and working capital 

our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

• changes to the us federal income tax laws including the potential for corporate tax increases under the new biden administration 

• changes to other tax laws regulations and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate including actions resulting from the organisation for economic cooperation and developments base erosion and profit shifting project proposed actions by international bodies such as digital services taxation as well as the requirements of certain tax rulings 

• changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates 

• the tax effects of significant infrequently occurring events that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods 

• tax assessments or any related tax interest or penalties that could significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in which the settlements take place and 

• taxes arising in connection to changes in our workforce corporate entity structure or operations as they relate to tax incentives and tax rates 

from time to time we receive notices that a tax authority in a particular jurisdiction believes that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority we are regularly engaged in discussions and sometimes disputes with these tax authorities if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected

key financial metrics 

the following table provides our key financial metrics for fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 



• net revenues increased 61 million primarily due to increased sales of our consumer security products and our identity and protection products partially offset by the divestiture of our id analytics solutions and the additional week of revenue recognized during fiscal 2020 

• operating income increased 541 million primarily due to lower compensation expense outside services expense and facility and it costs that were driven by our cost reduction programs partially offset by a legal accrual relating to an ongoing civil lawsuit involving a government contract with the us general services administration gsa 

• income from continuing operations increased 118 million primarily due to higher operating income gain on sale of our culver city and certain mountain view properties gain on extinguishment of debt and lower income tax expense partially offset by the absence of the 379 million gain on sale of our equity method investment in digicert and the 250 million gain on the sale of our id analytics solutions which were divested in fiscal 2020 

• we incurred a loss from discontinued operations net of tax compared to a gain during the corresponding period in fiscal 2020 primarily due to the absence of gain on the sale of certain of our enterprise security assets and certain liabilities to broadcom inc the “broadcom sale” the absence of operating income as a result of the broadcom sale and a settlement with broadcom in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 of all outstanding payments and certain claims related to the broadcom sale 

• net income and net income per share decreased primarily due to the loss from discontinued operations for the reasons discussed above partially offset by higher income from continuing operations

• contract liabilities increased 189 million compared to april 3 2020 primarily due to higher billings than recognized revenue and the acquisition of avira 

covid19 update 

  the covid19 pandemic is having widespread rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts on global society economies financial markets and business practices to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees partners and thirdparty service providers we implemented a near companywide workfromhome requirement for most employees made substantial modifications to employee travel policies and cancelled or shifted our conferences and other marketing events to virtualonly we continue to monitor the situation and plan to adjust our current policies as recommendations and public health guidance is changing to date we have not seen any meaningful negative impact on our customer success efforts sales and marketing efforts or employee productivity nevertheless as employees partners or thirdparty services providers return to work during the covid19 pandemic the risk of inadvertent transmission of covid19 through human contact could still occur and result in litigation 

the us and global economies have experienced a recession due to the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic although we did not experience a material increase in cancellations by customers or a material reduction in our retention rate in 

table of contents 

2021 we may experience such an increase or reduction in the future especially in the event of a prolonged recession as a result of the covid19 pandemic a prolonged recession could adversely affect demand for our offerings retention rates and harm our business and results of operations particularly in light of the fact that our solutions are discretionary purchases and thus may be more susceptible to macroeconomic pressures as well impact the value of our common stock ability to refinance our debt and our access to capital 

the duration and extent of the impact from the covid19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately forecasted at this time such as the severity and transmission rate of new variants of the disease the extent effectiveness and acceptance of containment actions such as vaccination programs and the impact of these and other factors on our employees customers partners and thirdparty service providers for more information on the risks associated with the covid19 pandemic please see “risk factors” in item 1a 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap requires us to make estimates including judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

business combinations 

we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of purchase price requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in determining the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets 

critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships developed technology trade names and acquired patents and discount rates management estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable thirdparty valuation specialists are also utilized for certain estimates unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

income taxes 

we are subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions we are required to estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess the temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes we apply judgment in the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes which includes the following critical accounting estimates 

we use a twostep process to recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any if we determine that the tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of various outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period 

loss contingencies 

we are subject to contingencies that expose us to losses including various legal and regulatory proceedings asserted and potential claims that arise in the ordinary course of business an estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and we may revise our estimates until the final resolution of such matters there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for that reporting period

results of operations 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 





note the percentages may not add due to rounding 

net revenues 



fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

net revenues increased 61 million primarily due to a 91 million increase in sales of our consumer security products and a 60 million increase in sales of our identity and protection products this was driven by the increase in our direct customer count yearoveryear and stable annual retention rate and average revenue per user arpu in fiscal 2021 the increase was partially offset by a 46 million decrease as a result of the divestiture of our id analytics solutions in january 2020 and 44 million of revenue recognized during an additional week in fiscal 2020 

fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 

net revenues increased 34 million primarily due to approximately 44 million of revenues from the additional week in fiscal 2020 

performance metrics 

we regularly monitor a number of metrics in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance our metrics may be calculated in a manner different than similar metrics used by other companies 

the following table summarizes supplemental key performance metrics for our solutions 

table of contents 





1 direct customer revenues in fiscal 2021 excludes a 5 million reduction of revenue from a contract liability purchase accounting adjustment recognized during the last quarter due to the acquisition of avira direct customer revenues in fiscal 2020 and 2019 excludes 46 million and 48 million respectively of revenue from id analytics solutions which were divested in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 

2 average direct customer count for fiscal 2021 is calculated as an average of the fiscal quarters the average direct customer count for the fourth fiscal quarter was prorated to include 16 million customers from the avira acquisition 

3 arpu in fiscal 2020 was normalized to exclude the impact of the extra week on direct revenue which we estimate to be approximately 41 million of direct customer revenue excluding this adjustment arpu would have been 907 in fiscal 2020 

we define direct customer revenues as revenues from sales of our consumer solutions to direct customers which we define as active paid users who have a direct billing relationship with us at the end of the reported period users with multiple products or entitlements are counted for based on which solutions they are subscribed we exclude users on free trials and promotions and users who have indirectly purchased our product or services through partners unless such users convert or renew their subscriptions directly with us 

from time to time we update our methodology due to changes in the business in fiscal 2021 the average direct customer count calculation has been refined primarily to prorate for acquisitions that happen during a quarter such as avira which was acquired in january 2021 the full year average direct customer count is calculated as an average across the quarters this change in methodology had an immaterial impact to historical amounts presented 

arpu is calculated as estimated direct customer revenues for the period divided by the average direct customer count for the same period expressed as a monthly figure we monitor arpu because it helps us understand the rate at which we are monetizing our consumer customer base 

annual retention rate is defined as the number of direct customers who have more than a oneyear tenure as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal period divided by the total number of direct customers as of the end of the period from one year ago we monitor annual retention rate to evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies to improve renewals of subscriptions 

net revenues by geographic region 

percentage of revenue by geographic region as presented below is based on the billing location of the customer 





percentages may not add to 100 due to rounding 

the americas include us canada and latin america emea includes europe middle east and africa apj includes asia pacific and japan 

percentage of revenue by geographic region remained consistent in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 

cost of revenues 



fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

our cost of revenues decreased 31 million primarily due to decreases in royalty charges and technical support costs partially offset by an increase in commissions reflecting higher investments in affiliate marketing programs 

fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 

table of contents 

our cost of revenues decreased 62 million primarily due to decreases in technical support costs and service costs partially offset by an increase in royalty charges in addition during fiscal 2019 we recorded higher inventory writeoffs of 10 million due to our discontinuation of our consumer hardware product line 

operating expenses 



fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

sales and marketing expense decreased 125 million primarily due to a 147 million decrease in shared facility and it costs partially offset by a 12 million increase in advertising and promotional expense 

research and development expense decreased 61 million due to a 44 million decrease in shared facility and it costs and a 17 million decrease in compensation driven by lower headcount 

general and administrative expense decreased 153 million primarily due to a 70 million decrease in compensation expense a 55 million decrease in shared facility and it costs and a 43 million decrease in outside services expense partially offset by an additional legal accrual of 25 million in fiscal 2021 relating to an ongoing civil lawsuit involving a government contract with the gsa 

the overall decreases in our sales and marketing research and development and general and administrative expenses were driven by our cost reduction initiatives 

amortization of intangible assets was relatively flat compared to fiscal 2020 

restructuring transition and other costs decreased 105 million primarily due to a 50 million decrease of contract cancellation charges and a 59 million decrease in severance costs in connection with our november 2019 restructuring plan the november 2019 plan the decrease was partially offset by a 11 million increase in asset writeoffs and impairments see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information on our restructuring plans 

fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 

sales and marketing expense decreased 11 million primarily due to a 75 million decrease in compensation expense and allocated corporate costs reflecting our cost reduction initiatives these decreases were partially offset by a 64 million increase in advertising and promotional expense reflecting our higher investments in direct marketing programs 

research and development expense decreased 92 million primarily due to a 77 million decrease in compensation expense and allocated corporate costs and a 23 million decrease in outside services reflecting our cost reduction initiatives 

general and administrative expense decreased 42 million primarily due to a 34 million decrease in compensation expense other than stockbased compensation and allocated corporate costs and a 18 million decrease in stockbased compensation expense

nonoperating income expense net 



fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

nonoperating income net of expense decreased 488 million primarily due the absence of the 379 million gain on sale of our equity method investment in digicert and the 250 million gain on the sale of our id analytics solutions which were divested in fiscal 2020 the decrease was partially offset by the absence of loss from our equity interest in digicert gain on sale of our culver city property and certain mountain view properties and the gain on extinguishment of debt due to the repayment of our 20 convertible notes in fiscal 2021 

fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 

nonoperating income net of expense increased 729 million primarily due to a 379 million gain on the sale of the digicert equity method investment and a 250 million gain on the sale of our id analytics solutions in fiscal 2020 in addition our loss from equity interest that was divested in fiscal 2020 decreased 70 million and our interest income increased 38 million as a result of higher investments in money market funds purchased with proceeds from the broadcom sale 

provision for income taxes 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and international tax jurisdictions our results of operations would be adversely affected to the extent that our geographical mix of income becomes more weighted toward jurisdictions with higher tax rates and would be favorably affected to the extent the relative geographic mix shifts to lower tax jurisdictions any change in our mix of earnings is dependent upon many factors and is therefore difficult to predict 



fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to releases in uncertain tax positions and favorable withholding tax rulings 

fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 

our effective tax rate increased primarily due to an increase in income taxes from nondeductible goodwill and an increase in income taxes as a result of the altera ninth circuit opinion see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for information about the altera ninth circuit opinion 

table of contents 

discontinued operations 



fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

we incurred a loss from discontinued operations in fiscal 2021 compared to a gain during the corresponding period in fiscal 2020 primarily due to the absence of gain on the broadcom sale the absence of operating income as a result of the broadcom sale and a 200 million settlement with broadcom in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 of all outstanding payments and certain claims related to the broadcom sale 

fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019

completed in fiscal 2022 see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further cash flow information associated with our restructuring activities 

contractual obligations 

the following is a schedule of our significant contractual obligations as of april 2 2021 including those associated with our discontinued operations the expected timing of payments of the obligations in the following table is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 





1 interest payments were calculated based on the contractual terms of the related senior notes convertible senior notes and credit facility interest on variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate in effect as of april 2 2021 see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information on the senior notes convertible senior notes and term loans 

2 these amounts are associated with agreements for purchases of goods or services generally including agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction the table above also includes agreements to purchase goods or services that have cancellation provisions requiring little or no payment the amounts under such contracts are included in the table above because management believes that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely and we expect to make future cash payments according to the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials 

3 these amounts represent the transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries under the tax cuts and jobs act which may be paid through july 2025 

4 we have entered into various noncancelable operating lease agreements that expire on various dates through fiscal 2028 the amounts in the table above exclude expected sublease income see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information on leases 

due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits and other longterm taxes as of april 2 2021 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities therefore 525 million in longterm income taxes payable has been excluded from the contractual obligations table see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information 

indemnifications 

in the ordinary course of business we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers vendors lessors business partners subsidiaries and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of agreements or representations and warranties made by us in connection with the sale of veritas and the sale of our enterprise security business to broadcom we assigned several leases to veritas technologies llc or broadcom andor their related subsidiaries in addition our bylaws contain indemnification obligations to our directors officers employees and agents and we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers to give such directors and officers additional contractual assurances regarding the scope of the indemnification set forth in our bylaws and to provide additional procedural protections we maintain director and officer insurance which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers refer to note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information on our indemnifications 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies we do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

our shortterm investments and cash equivalents primarily consist of corporate bonds and certificate of deposits respectively a change in interest could have an adverse impact on their market value as of april 2 2021 the carrying value and fair value of our shortterm investments and cash equivalents was 18 million a hypothetical change in the yield curve of 100 basis points would not result in a significant reduction in fair value 

as of april 2 2021 we had 24 billion in aggregate principal amount of fixedrate senior notes and convertible debt outstanding with a carrying amount and a fair value of 24 billion based on level 2 inputs since these notes bear interest at 

table of contents 

fixed rates they do not result in any financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change 

as of april 2 2021 we also had 12 billion outstanding debt with variable interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate libor a reasonably possible hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points in libor would not result in a significant increase in interest expense on an annualized basis 

in addition we have a 1 billion revolving credit facility that if drawn bears interest at a variable rate based on libor and would be subject to the same risks associated with adverse changes in libor 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we conduct business in numerous currencies through our worldwide operations and our entities hold monetary assets or liabilities earn revenues or incur costs in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency primarily in euro japanese yen british pound israeli new shekel swiss franc singapore dollar and indian rupee in addition we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services we provide our cash flow results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities as a result we are exposed to foreign exchange gains or losses which impacts our operating results 

we have a foreign exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures manage these exposures and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our results of operations through which we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries with up to twelve months in duration we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of the changes in foreign exchange rates the gains and losses on these foreign exchange contracts are recorded in other income expense net in the consolidated statements of operations 

as of april 2 2021 and april 3 2020 we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of 338 million and 419 million respectively to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposure with an insignificant fair value a hypothetical ten percent depreciation of foreign currency would result in a reduction in fair value of our forward contracts of 20 million and 30 million for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively this analysis disregards the possibilities that the rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area

 item 9a controls and procedures 

a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the sec defines the term “disclosure controls and procedures” to mean a company’s controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms “disclosure controls and procedures” include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act 

based on such evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report 

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f of the exchange act for nortonlifelock our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of april 2 2021 based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” 

we acquired avira during january 2021 management excluded avira from its assessment of the effectiveness of nortonlifelock inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of april 2 2021 total assets and total revenues of avira represent approximately 1 or 67 million and 1 or 21 million respectively of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended april 2 2021 management did not assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting at avira due to the complexity associated with assessing internal control during integration efforts as well as the limited amount of time between the transaction date and the assessment date of april 2 2021 

our management has concluded that as of april 2 2021 our internal control over financial reporting was effective at the reasonable assurance level based on these criteria 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of april 2 2021 has been audited by kpmg llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k 

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended april 2 2021 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting we have not experienced any significant impact to our internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that a significant number of employees continue to work remotely due to the covid19 pandemic the design of our processes and controls allow for remote execution with accessibility to secure data we are continually monitoring and assessing the covid19 situation to minimize the impact if any on the design and operating effectiveness on our internal controls 

d limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within our company have been detected

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving business environment we believe that the competitive factors in our market include access to a breadth of identity and consumer transaction data broad and effective service offerings brand recognition technology effective and costefficient customer acquisition having a large customer base and strong retention rate customer satisfaction price convenience of purchase ease of use frequency of upgrades and updates and quality and reliable customer service our competitors vary by offering geography and channel 

our principal competitors are set forth below 

 we believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the strength of our technology people product offerings and integration across all the cyber safety pillars however some of our competitors have substantially greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we possess that afford them competitive advantages as a result they may be able to devote greater resources to develop promote and sell their offerings deliver competitive offerings at lower prices or for free and introduce new solutions and respond to market developments and customer requirements more quickly than we can for more information on the risks associated with our competitors please see “risk factors” in item 1a 

research and development 

as cyber threats evolve we are focused on delivering a portfolio that protects each element of our customers’ digital lives to do this we embrace innovation and have developed a global research and development strategy across our cyber safety platform our engineering and product management teams are focused on delivering new versions of existing offerings as well as developing entirely new offerings to drive the company’s global leadership in cyber safety we have a technology research organization focused on applied research projects with the goal of rapidly creating new products to address consumer trends and grow the business including defending consumer digital privacy also nortonlifelock’s threat response and security technology organization is a global organization made up of leading threat and security researchers supported by advanced systems to innovate security technology and threat intelligence as the consumer ally for cyber safety protecting our customers against known and emerging threats 

nortonlifelock has a long history of innovation and we plan to invest in research and development to drive our longterm success 

intellectual property 

we are a leader amongst cyber safety solutions for consumers in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 1000 us and international patents issued with many pending we protect our intellectual property rights and investments in a variety of ways to safeguard our technologies and our longterm success we work actively in the us and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright trademark trade secret and other protections that apply to our software products and services the term of the patents we hold is on average twelve years from time to time we enter into crosslicense agreements with other technology companies covering broad groups of patents we have an additional portfolio of over 2500 us and international patents crosslicensed to us as part of our arrangement with broadcom as a result of the asset sale of our former enterprise security business 

circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights effective intellectual property protection may not be available and the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete in addition protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results 

companies in the technology industry may own a large number of patents copyrights and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of 

intellectual property rights from time to time we face and we expect to face in the future allegations that we have infringed the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties including our competitors as we face increasing competition and as our business grows we may face more claims of infringement for more information on the risks associated with our intellectual property please see “risk factors” in item 1a 

thirdparty service providers 

we are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure to provide our products and services to our customers for example we host many of our products using thirdparty data center facilities and we do not control the operation of these facilities in addition our endpoint security solution has historically relied upon certain threat analytics software engines and other software enginerelated services that have been developed and provided by engineering teams that have transferred to broadcom as part of the broadcom sale the technology including source code at issue is shared and pursuant to the terms of the broadcom sale we retain rights to use modify enhance and create derivative works from such technology broadcom has committed to provide these enginerelated services under a transition services agreement substantially to the same extent and in substantially the same manner as has been historically provided for information on the risks associated with our dependence on such thirdparty service providers please see “risk factors” in item 1a 

governmental regulation 

we collect use store or disclose an increasingly high volume variety and velocity of personal information including from employees and customers in connection with the operation of our business particularly in relation to our identity and information protection offerings which rely on large data repositories of personal information and consumer transactions the personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal state local and foreign laws regarding privacy and data security for information on the risks associated with complying with privacy and data security laws please see “risk factors” in item 1a 

seasonality

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business strategy and industry 

the covid19 pandemic has affected how we are operating our business and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain 

the covid19 pandemic is having widespread rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts on global society economies financial markets and business practices federal and state governments have implemented measures to contain the virus including social distancing travel restrictions border closures limitations on public gatherings work from home and closure of nonessential businesses to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees partners and thirdparty service providers we have implemented a near companywide workfromhome requirement for most employees until further notice made substantial modifications to employee travel policies and cancelled or shifted our conferences and other marketing events to virtualonly for the foreseeable future while we continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies as more information and public health guidance become available such precautionary measures could negatively affect our customer success efforts sales and marketing efforts or create operational or other challenges such as a reduction in employee productivity because of the work from home requirement any of which could harm our business and results of operations further if the covid19 

pandemic has a substantial impact on our employees partners or thirdparty service providers’ health attendance or productivity our results of operations and overall financial performance may be adversely impacted additionally if employees partners or thirdparty services providers return to work during the covid19 pandemic the risk of inadvertent transmission of covid 19 through human contact could still occur and result in litigation  

beginning in march 2020 the us and global economies have reacted negatively in response to worldwide concerns due to the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic although we have not yet experienced a material increase in customers cancellations or a material reduction in our retention rate in 2020 we may experience such an increase or reduction in the future especially in the event of a prolonged economic down turn as a result of the covid19 pandemic a prolonged economic downturn could result adversely affect demand for our offerings retention rates and harm our business and results of operations particularly in light of the fact that our solutions are discretionary purchases and thus may be more susceptible to macroeconomic pressures  as well impact the value of our common stock ability to refinance our debt and our access to capital 

the duration and extent of the impact from the covid19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately forecasted at this time such as the severity and transmission rate of the disease the extent and effectiveness of containment actions and the impact of these and other factors on our employees customers partners and thirdparty service providers if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively and if the macroeconomic conditions of the general economy or the industries in which we operate do not improve or deteriorate further our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to develop new and enhanced solutions or if we are unable to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our existing solutions our competitive position may weaken and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our future success depends on our ability to effectively respond to evolving threats to consumers as well as competitive technological developments and industry changes by developing or introducing new and enhanced solutions on a timely basis 

we have in the past incurred and will continue to incur significant research and development expenses as we strive to remain competitive and as we focus on organic growth through internal innovation following the broadcom sale as defined below our resources for research and development have decreased which could put us at a competitive disadvantage nevertheless we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position which include for example decreasing our reliance on third parties for our enginerelated services if we are unable to anticipate or react to competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a decline in our revenues that could adversely affect our business and operating results if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected additionally we must continually address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends and competitive developments customers may require features and capabilities that our current solutions do not have our failure to develop new solutions and improve our existing solutions to satisfy customer preferences and effectively compete with other market offerings   in a timely and costeffective manner may harm our ability to retain our customers and to create or increase demand for our solutions which may adversely impact our operating results 

the development and introduction of new solutions involve a significant commitment of time and resources and are subject to a number of risks and challenges including but not limited to 

 if we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges or if our new or improved solutions are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

we operate in a highly competitive environment and our competitors may gain market share in the markets for our solutions that could adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to decline 

we operate in intensely competitive markets that experience frequent technological developments changes in industry and regulatory standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements if we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a decline in our revenues that could adversely affect our business and operating results to compete successfully we must maintain an innovative research and development effort to develop new solutions and enhance our existing solutions effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors appropriately respond to competitive strategies and effectively adapt to technological changes and changes in the ways that our information is accessed used and stored by our customers if we are unsuccessful in responding to our 

competitors or to changing technological and customer demands our competitive position and our financial results could be adversely affected 

our competitors include software vendors that offer solutions that directly compete with our offerings in addition to competing with these vendors directly for sales to endusers of our solutions we compete with them for the opportunity to have our solutions bundled with the offerings of our strategic partners such as computer hardware original equipment manufacturers oems and internet service providers isps and operating systems our competitors could gain market share from us if any of these strategic partners replace our solutions with those of our competitors or if these partners more actively promote our competitors’ solutions than our own in addition software vendors who have bundled our solutions with theirs may choose to bundle their solutions with their own or other vendors’ solutions or may limit our access to standard interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop solutions for their platform in the future further product development by these vendors could cause our solutions to become redundant which could significantly impact our sales and financial results 

we face growing competition from other technology companies as well as from companies in the identity threat protection space such as credit bureaus many of these competitors are increasingly developing and incorporating into their products data protection software that competes at some levels with our offerings our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our solutions 

security protection is also offered by some of our competitors at prices lower than our prices or in some cases is offered free of charge our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive these lower cost or free security products as replacing the need for full featured solutions like ours the expansion of these competitive trends could have a significant negative impact on our revenues and operating results by causing among other things price reductions of our solutions reduced profitability and loss of market share 

many of our competitors have greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do and consequently may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their products instead of ours further consolidation within our industry or other changes in the competitive environment could result in larger competitors that compete with us we also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the market in which we compete 

we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully 

the intense competition we face in addition to general and economic business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain solutions or provide offerings we may need to lower prices in order to compete successfully similarly if there is pressure by competitors to raise prices our ability to acquire new customers and retain existing customers may be diminished any such changes may reduce revenue and margins and could adversely affect our financial results 

additionally our business may be affected by changes in the macroeconomic environment our solutions are discretionary purchases and customers may reduce or eliminate their discretionary spending on our solutions during a difficult macroeconomic environment although we have not yet experienced a material increase in customers cancellations or a material reduction in our retention rate in 2020 we may experience such an increase or reduction in the future especially in the event of a prolonged economic down turn or a worsening of current conditions as a result of the covid19 pandemic in addition during an economic downturn consumers may experience a decline in their credit or disposable income which may result in less demand for our solutions as a result we may have to lower our prices or make other changes to our pricing model to address these dynamics any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively or if our partners choose not to market and sell our solutions to their customers our operating results could be adversely affected 

a portion of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels including but not limited to distributors that sell our products to endusers and other resellers and oem partners that incorporate our products into or bundle our products with their products these channels involve a number of risks including 



if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels successfully these channels may conflict with one another or otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate which could reduce our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our competitive position if our partners suffer financial difficulties in the future because of general economic conditions or for other reasons these partners may delay paying their obligations to us and we may have reduced revenues or collections that could adversely affect our operating results in addition reliance on multiple channels subjects us to events that could cause unpredictability in demand which could increase the risk that we may be unable to plan effectively for the future and adversely affect our operating results 

our revenue and operating results depend significantly on our ability to retain our existing customers and add new customers and any decline in our retention rates or failure to add new customers will harm our future revenue and operating results 

our revenue and operating results depend significantly on our ability to retain our existing customers and add new customers we sell our solutions to our customers on a monthly or annual subscription basis customers may cancel their membership with us at any time without penalty we therefore may be unable to retain our existing customers on the same or on more profitable terms if at all in addition we may not be able to predict or anticipate accurately future trends in customer retention or effectively respond to such trends our customer retention rates may decline or fluctuate due to a variety of factors including the following 

 if we do not retain our existing customers and add new customers our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline and our operating results and gross margins will be harmed in addition our business and operating results may be harmed if we are unable to increase our retention rates 

we also must continually add new customers both to replace customers who cancel or elect not to renew their agreements with us and to grow our business beyond our current customer base if we are unable to attract new customers in numbers greater than the percentage of customers who cancel or elect not to renew their agreements with us our customer base will decrease and our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our acquisitions and divestitures create special risks and challenges that could adversely affect our financial results 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire or divest businesses or assets for example we recently completed the sale of certain of our enterprise security assets to broadcom inc the “broadcom sale” these activities can involve a number of risks and challenges including 

 we have invested and continue to invest and devote significant resources in the integration of businesses we acquire the success of each acquisition depends in part on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities including certain cost savings and operational efficiencies or synergies and growth prospects from integrating these businesses in an efficient and 

effective manner if integration of our acquired businesses is not successful we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects to integrate acquired businesses we must integrate and manage the personnel and business systems of the acquired operations further we may need to enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions moreover to be successful large complex acquisitions depend on largescale product technology and sales force integrations that are difficult to complete on a timely basis or at all and may be more susceptible to the special risks and challenges described above 

in addition we have and may in the future divest businesses product lines or assets with the broadcom sale being a recent example such initiatives may require significant separation activities that could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention loss of employees substantial separation costs and accounting charges for asset impairments please see “risks related to the broadcom sale” below for additional information regarding our divestiture risks 

any of the foregoing and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability or other financial benefits from our acquired or divested businesses product lines or assets or to realize other anticipated benefits of divestitures or acquisitions 

risks related to the broadcom sale 

we may not achieve the intended benefits of the broadcom sale 

we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the broadcom sale the resource constraints that resulted from the completion of the transaction included the loss of employees and could have a continuing impact on the execution of our business strategy and our overall operating results further our remaining employees may become concerned about the future of our remaining operations and lose focus or seek other employment 

we are dependent upon broadcom for certain engineering and threat response services which are critical to our products and business  we could lose our access to these or other data sources including threat intelligence which could cause us competitive harm and have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

our endpoint security solution has historically relied upon certain threat analytics software engines and other software the enginerelated services that have been developed and provided by engineering teams that have transferred to broadcom as part of the broadcom sale the technology including source code at issue is shared and pursuant to the terms of the broadcom sale we retain rights to use modify enhance and create derivative works from such technology broadcom has committed to provide these enginerelated services under a transition services agreement substantially to the same extent and in substantially the same manner as has been historically provided as a result we are dependent on broadcom for services and technology that are critical to our business and if broadcom fails to deliver these enginerelated services it would result in significant business disruption and our business and operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected furthermore we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain data from alternative or additional sources if our current sources become unavailable and if we are able to obtain alternative sources we could be unable to integrate or deploy them in time which could cause us competitive harm and have a material adverse effect on our business additionally in connection with the broadcom sale we lost many industryspecific engineers and other capabilities including certain threat intelligence data which were historically provided by our former enterprise security business the lack of which could have a negative impact on our business and products 

any cost reduction initiatives that we undertake may not deliver the results we expect and these actions may adversely affect our business 

in november 2019 our board of directors approved a restructuring plan the november 2019 plan in connection with the strategic decision to divest our enterprise security business actions under this plan include the reduction of our workforce by approximately 3100 employees as well as asset writeoffs contract terminations facilities closures and the sale of underutilized facilities we estimate that we will incur total costs of 550 million in connection with the november 2019 plan excluding stockbased compensation expense of which approximately 200 million are expected to consist of cash expenditures for severance and termination benefits and 110 million of cash expenditures for contract terminations noncash costs are estimated to be up to 240 million related to asset writeoffs and other restructuring costs these actions are expected to be completed by september 2020 this initiative could result in disruptions to our operations any costcutting measures could also negatively impact our business by delaying the introduction of new products or technologies interrupting service of additional products or impacting employee retention in addition we cannot assure you that the cost reduction and streamlining initiatives will be as successful in reducing our overall expenses as we expect or that additional costs will not offset any such reductions or streamlining of our operations if our operating costs are higher than we expect if the expected proceeds from the sale of underutilized assets do not meet expectations or if we do not maintain adequate control of our costs and expenses our results of operations will suffer 

if we are unsuccessful at executing the transition of the enterprise security business assets from the broadcom sale our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited 

for the last several years we have experienced transitions in our business with the integration of two major acquisitions the completion of several smaller acquisitions and the broadcom sale which comprised an operating segment these transitions have involved significant turnover in executive management and other key personnel and changes in our strategic direction as well as resulted in the relocation of our headquarters to tempe arizona transitions of this type can be disruptive result in the 

loss of focus and employee morale and make the execution of business strategies more difficult we may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to such transitions and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs if we do not succeed in these efforts or if these efforts are more costly or timeconsuming than expected our business and results of operations may be adversely affected which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business 

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuance of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairments 

in response to changes in industry structure and market conditions and in connection with the broadcom sale we may be required to strategically reallocate our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting certain businesses any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions although in certain instances our vendor agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel reschedule or adjust with suppliers 

further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to evaluate goodwill impairment on an annual basis and between annual evaluations in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment evaluations may result in a charge to earnings 

risks related to our operations 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees lose key personnel fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully or fail to manage our employee base effectively we may be unable to develop new and enhanced solutions effectively manage or expand our business or increase our revenues 

our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key management technical including cyber security experts sales marketing ecommerce finance and other personnel our officers and other key personnel are “at will” employees and we generally do not have employment or noncompete agreements with our employees and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them competition for people with the specific skills that we require is significant and we may face new and unexpected difficulties in attracting retaining and motivating employees in connection with the relocation of our headquarters to tempe arizona in connection with the broadcom sale we experienced employee attrition and related difficulties and these difficulties and loss of certain expertise and capabilities may continue or increase 

in order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace we must provide competitive pay packages including cash and equitybased compensation additionally changes in immigration laws could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business results of operations and future growth prospects could suffer the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees in addition we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number of shares required for issuance under our equity compensation plans as a result we may issue fewer equitybased incentives and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees or conversely if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution from time to time key personnel leave our company and the frequency and number of such departures has widely varied and have resulted in significant changes to our executive leadership team although we strive to reduce the negative impact of changes in our leadership the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives our internal control over financial reporting and our results of operations in addition hiring training and successfully integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time consuming and expensive may cause additional disruptions to our operations and may be unsuccessful which could negatively impact future financial results 

our inability to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity event could impair our ability to deliver our products and services and harm our business 

we are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure to provide our products and services to our customers for example we host many of our products using thirdparty data center facilities and we do not control the operation of these facilities these facilities are vulnerable to damage interruption or performance problems from earthquakes hurricanes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures pandemics such as the recent covid19 pandemic and similar events they are also subject to breakins computer viruses sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct the occurrence of a natural disaster an act of terrorism a pandemic such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic and similar events could result in a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems which in turn could result in lengthy interruptions in the delivery of our products and services which could negatively impact our sales and operating results 

furthermore our business administration human resources compliance efforts and finance services depend on the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations a disruption or failure of these systems or operations because of a disaster or other business continuity event such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic could 

cause data to be lost or otherwise delay our ability to complete sales and provide the highest level of service to our customers in addition we could have difficulty producing accurate financial statements on a timely basis and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting which may impact our ability to certify our financial results all of which could adversely affect the trading value of our stock although we endeavor to ensure there is redundancy in these systems and that they are regularly backedup there are no assurances that data recovery in the event of a disaster would be effective or occur in an efficient manner including the operation of our global civilian cyber intelligence threat network   if these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions 

in light of the ongoing covid19 pandemic we have implemented a near companywide workfromhome requirement for most employees until further notice while we have not experienced any material disruptions to date there can be no assurance that our technological systems or infrastructure is or will be equipped to facilitate effective remote working arrangements and effectively operate in full compliance with all laws and regulations for our employees in the short or long term 

our international operations involve risks that could increase our expenses adversely affect our operating results and require increased time and attention of our management 

we derive a portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the us and we have significant operations outside of the us including engineering sales and customer support our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations including   

 a significant portion of our transactions outside of the us is denominated in foreign currencies accordingly our revenues and expenses will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates we have in the past and expect in the future to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates especially if international sales grow as a percentage of our total sales or our operations outside the us continue to increase and foreign currency rates continue to experience increased volatility due to the covid19 pandemics 

risks related to our solutions 

our solutions systems and website and the data on these sources may be subject to intentional disruption that could materially harm to our reputation and future sales 

despite our precautions and significant ongoing investments to protect against security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and other intentional disruptions of our solutions we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance and availability of our offerings and harm our reputation as a company similarly experienced computer programmers or other sophisticated individuals or entities including malicious hackers statesponsored organizations and insider threats including actions by employees and thirdparty service providers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our systems and websites and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services including the operation of the global civilian cyber intelligence threat network this risk may be increased during the current covid19 pandemic as more individuals are work from home and utilize home networks for the transmission of sensitive information such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication and if successful could expose us and the affected parties to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of our business operations 

while we engage in a number of measures aimed to protect against security breaches and to minimize problems if a data breach were to occur our information technology systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage compromise 

disruption and shutdown due to attacks or breaches by hackers or due to other circumstances such as error or malfeasance by employees or third party service providers or technology malfunction the occurrence of any of these events as well as a failure to promptly remedy these events should they occur could compromise our systems and the information stored in our systems could be accessed publicly disclosed lost stolen or damaged any such circumstance could adversely affect our ability to attract and maintain customers as well as strategic partners cause us to suffer negative publicity and subject us to legal claims and liabilities or regulatory penalties in addition unauthorized parties might alter information in our databases which would adversely affect both the reliability of that information and our ability to market and perform our services techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently are constantly evolving and generally are difficult to recognize and react to effectively we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive or reactive measures several recent highly publicized data security breaches at other companies have heightened consumer awareness of this issue and may embolden individuals or groups to target our systems or those of our strategic partners or enterprise customers 

our solutions are complex and operate in a wide variety of environments systems and configurations which could result in failures of our solutions to function as designed and negatively impact our brand recognition and reputation  

because we offer very complex solutions errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our solutions may and have occurred for example we may experience disruptions outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors including infrastructure changes human or software errors capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our websites simultaneously fraud or security attacks in some instances we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time interruptions in our solutions including the operati on of the global civilian cyber intelligence threat network could impact our revenues or cause customers to cease doing business with us our operations are d ependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we could potentially lose customer data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of solutions to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario 

further our business would be harmed if any of the events of this nature caused our customers and potential customers to believe our solutions are unreliable our brand recognition and reputation are critical aspects of our business to retaining existing customers and attracting new customers furthermore negative publicity whether or not justified relating to events or activities attributed to us our employees our strategic partners our affiliates or others associated with any of these parties may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our solutions and have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover any attempts to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands may be costly and time consuming and such efforts may not ultimately be successful 

we collect use disclose store or otherwise process personal information which subjects us to privacy and data security laws and contractual commitments and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and commitments could harm our business 

we collect use process store transmit or disclose collectively process an increasingly large amount of confidential information including personally identifiable information credit card information and other critical data from employees and customers in connection with the operation of our business particularly in relation to our identity and information protection offerings 

the personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal state local and foreign laws regarding privacy and data security as well as contractual commitments any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions fines litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business 

additionally changes to applicable privacy or data security laws could impact how we process personal information and therefore limit the effectiveness of our solutions or our ability to develop new solutions for example the european union general data protection regulation imposes more stringent data protection requirements and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of €20 million or four percent of worldwide annual revenues 

data protection legislation is also becoming increasingly common in the us at both the federal and state level for example the california consumer privacy act of 2018 the ccpa came into effect on january 1 2020 the ccpa requires companies that process information on california residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection use and sharing practices allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches additionally the federal trade commission the ftc and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection use dissemination and security of data the burdens imposed by the ccpa and other similar laws that may be enacted at the federal and state level may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial expenditures in order to comply 

global privacy and data protection legislation enforcement and policy activity are rapidly expanding and evolving and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction we may be or become subject to data localization laws mandating that data collected in a foreign country be processed and stored only within that country if any country in which we have customers were to adopt a data localization law we could be required to expand our data storage facilities there or build new ones in order to comply the expenditure this would require as well as costs of compliance generally could harm our financial condition 

additionally third parties with whom we work such as vendors or developers may violate applicable laws or our policies and such violations can place personal information of our customers at risk in addition o ur customers may also accidentally disclose their passwords or store them on a device that is lost or stolen creating the perception that our systems are not secure against thirdparty access this could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business in addition such third parties could be the target of cyberattack and other data breaches which could impact our systems or our customers’ records 

legal and compliance risks 

matters relating to or arising from our completed audit committee investigation including regulatory investigations and proceedings litigation matters and potential additional expenses may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

as previously disclosed in our public filings the audit committee completed its internal investigation in september 2018 in connection with the audit committee investigation we voluntarily selfreported to the sec the sec commenced a formal investigation and we continue to cooperate with that investigation the outcome of such an investigation is difficult to predict if the sec commences legal action we could be required to pay significant penalties and become subject to injunctions a cease and desist order and other equitable remedies we can provide no assurances as to the outcome of any governmental investigation 

we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses related to legal and other professional services in connection with the ongoing sec investigation which may continue to adversely affect our business and financial condition in addition securities class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against us our directors and officers the outcome of the securities class actions and other litigation and regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions is difficult to predict and the cost to defend settle or otherwise resolve these matters may be significant plaintiffs or regulatory agencies or authorities in these matters may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts or seek to impose sanctions including significant monetary penalties the monetary and other impact of these litigations proceedings or actions may remain unknown for substantial periods of time further an unfavorable resolution of litigations proceedings or actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and cash flows any future investigations or additional lawsuits may also adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our solutions are highly regulated which could impede our ability to market and provide our solutions or adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

our solutions are subject to a high degree of regulation including a wide variety of federal state and local laws and regulations such as the fair credit reporting act the grammleachbliley act the federal trade commission act ftc act and comparable state laws that are patterned after the ftc act lifelock has previously entered into consent decrees and similar arrangements with the ftc and the attorney generals of 35 states as well as a settlement with the ftc relating to allegations that certain of lifelock’s advertising marketing and security practices constituted deceptive acts or practices in violation of the ftc act which impose additional restrictions on our business including prohibitions against making any misrepresentation of “the means methods procedures effects effectiveness coverage or scope of” our solutions any of the laws and regulations that apply to our business are subject to revision or new or changed interpretations and we cannot predict the impact of such changes on our business 

additionally the nature of our identity and information protection products subjects us to the broad regulatory supervisory and enforcement powers of the consumer financial protection bureau which may exercise authority with respect to our services or the marketing and servicing of those services by overseeing our financial institution or credit reporting agency customers and suppliers or by otherwise exercising its supervisory regulatory or enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services 

if we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology our financial results could be harmed 

much of our software and underlying technology is proprietary we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws however these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties third parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise obtain use distribute and sell our proprietary information without authorization 

third parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently by designing around our patents our consumer agreements do not require a signature and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions furthermore the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the us and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries the unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could adversely affect our ability to access software operating system and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor or cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products to their customers in addition any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in could be costly may distract management from daytoday operations and may lead to additional claims against us which could adversely affect our operating results 

from time to time we are a party to lawsuits and investigations which typically require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses and which could negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have initiated and been named as a party to lawsuits including patent litigation class actions and governmental claims and we may be named in additional litigation the expense of initiating and defending and in some cases settling such litigation may be costly and divert management’s attention from the daytoday operations of our business which could adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows in addition an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could result in significant fines settlements monetary damages or injunctive relief that could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business results of operations and cash flows 

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

from time to time third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights including claims regarding patents copyrights and trademarks because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that the number of these claims may grow in addition former employers of our former current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us confidential or proprietary information of these former employers any such claim with or without merit could result in costly litigation and distract management from daytoday operations if we are not successful in defending such claims we could be required to stop selling delay shipments of or redesign our solutions pay monetary amounts as damages enter into royalty or licensing arrangements or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers we cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to investigate defend and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

in addition we license and use software from third parties in our business these thirdparty software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and may expose us to additional liability this liability or our inability to use any of this thirdparty software could result in delivery delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

some of our products contain “open source” software and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business 

certain of our products are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under socalled “open source” licenses which may include by way of example the gnu general public license gnu lesser general public license the mozilla public license the bsd license and the apache license 

some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use by the terms of certain open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner in addition to risks related to license requirements usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software we have established processes to help alleviate these risks including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products in addition many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated and could if not properly addressed negatively affect our business 

risks related to our financial results 

fluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected the trading price of our outstanding securities in the past and could affect the trading price of our outstanding securities in the future 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary in the future due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts and investors the trading price of our outstanding securities could be negatively affected volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance 

factors associated with our industry the operation of our business and the markets for our solutions may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate including but not limited to 



 any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of our outstanding securities to fluctuate significantly 

changes to our effective tax rate could increase our income tax expense and reduce increase our net income loss cash flows and working capital 

our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

 we report our results of operations based on our determination of the aggregate amount of taxes owed in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate from time to time we receive notices that a tax authority in a particular jurisdiction believes that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority we are regularly engaged in discussions and sometimes disputes with these tax authorities if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks related to our liquidity and indebtedness 

we cannot predict our future capital needs and we may be unable to obtain financing which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

adverse economic conditions or a change in our business performance may make it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations investing activities including potential acquisitions or divestitures or financing activities any required financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all if we raise additional funds by obtaining loans from third parties the terms of those financing arrangements may include negative covenants or other restrictions on our business that could impair our financial or operational flexibility and would also require us to fund additional interest expense if additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to successfully develop or enhance our solutions through acquisitions in order to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures which could have a material adverse effect on our solutions offerings revenues results of operations and financial condition 

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity capital position ability to hedge certain financial risks borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

our credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies and such agencies have in the past and could in the future downgrade our ratings we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position ability to hedge certain financial risks and access to capital markets in addition changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could increase the interest we pay on outstanding or future debt 

there are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness that could adversely affect our financial condition 

as of april 3 2020 we had an aggregate of 43 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature in calendar years 2020 through 2025 including approximately 15 billion in aggregate principal amount of existing convertible notes 23 billion of senior notes and 05 billion of outstanding term loans under our senior secured credit facility and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future andor enter into new financing arrangements in addition as of april 3 2020 we had 10 billion available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility our ability to meet expenses to remain in compliance with the covenants under our debt instruments and to pay interest and repay principal for our substantial level of indebtedness depends on among other things our operating performance competitive developments and financial market conditions all of which are significantly affected by financial business economic and other factors we are not able to control many of these factors accordingly our cash flow may not be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt including the notes and meet our other obligations 

our level of indebtedness could have other important consequences including the following 

 there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully 

in addition we conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries which are generally not guarantors of our debt accordingly repayment of our indebtedness will be dependent in part on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise in general our subsidiaries will not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our debt or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make the required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

changes in the method of determining libor or the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate may adversely affect interest rates on our current or future indebtedness and may otherwise adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

certain of our indebtedness is made at variable interest rates that use the london interbank offered rate or libor or metrics derived from or related to libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate in 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 if libor ceases to exist we may need to renegotiate our debt arrangements that extend beyond 2021 that utilize libor as a factor in determining the interest rate which may negatively impact the terms of such indebtedness in addition the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase out or replacement of libor disruption in the financial markets could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

our existing credit agreements impose operating and financial restrictions on us 

the existing credit agreements contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to 

 all of these covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance our operations meet or otherwise address our capital needs pursue business opportunities react to market conditions or otherwise restrict activities or business plans a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness if a default occurs the relevant lenders could elect to declare the indebtedness together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable and to the extent such indebtedness is secured in the future proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included under item 15 of this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

we are a leading provider of cyber safety solutions for consumers during fiscal year 2020 we completed the sale of our enterprise security assets to broadcom inc broadcom and the sale of our id analytics solutions to lexisnexis risk solutions part of relx inc with the sale of our enterprise assets we have transformed ourselves into a pure consumer company our nortonlifelock branded solutions help customers protect their devices online privacy identity and home networks 

fiscal year highlights 

 the divestiture of our enterprise security business allowed us to shift our operational focus to our consumer business and represented a strategic shift in our operations as a result the results of our enterprise security business are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and thus are excluded from both continuing operations for all periods presented accordingly we now have one reportable segment revenues and associated costs of our id analytics solutions which were formerly included in the enterprise security segment were included in our remaining reportable segment 

 subsequent event 

in may 2020 we settled the principal and conversion rights of 625 million of our 20 convertible notes for 118 billion in cash 

fiscal calendar and basis of presentation 

we have a 5253week fiscal year ending on the friday closest to march 31 fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 in this report refers to fiscal year ended april 3 2020  march 29 2019  and march 30 2018  respectively fiscal 2020 was a 53week year whereas fiscal 2019 and 2018 each consisted of 52 weeks 

key financial metrics 

the following table provides our key financial metrics for fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019 



 covid19 update 

  the covid19 pandemic is having widespread rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts on global society economies financial markets and business practices federal and state governments have implemented measures to contain the virus including social distancing travel restrictions border closures limitations on public gatherings work from home and closure of nonessential businesses further beginning in march 2020 the us and global economies have reacted negatively in response to worldwide concerns due to the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic 

to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees partners and thirdparty service providers we have implemented a near companywide workfromhome requirement for most employees until further notice made substantial modifications to employee travel policies and cancelled or shifted our conferences and other marketing events to virtualonly for the foreseeable future while we continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies as more information and public health guidance become available such precautionary measures could negatively affect our customer success efforts sales and marketing efforts or create operational or other challenges such as a reduction in employee productivity because of the work from home requirement any of which could harm our business and results of operations further if the covid19 pandemic has a substantial impact on our employees partners or thirdparty service providers’ health attendance or productivity our results of operations and overall financial performance may be adversely impacted additionally if employees partners or thirdparty services providers return to work during the covid19 pandemic the risk of inadvertent transmission of covid 19 through human contact could still occur and result in litigation  although we have not yet experienced a material increase in customers cancellations or a material reduction in our retention rate in 2020 a prolonged economic downturn could result adversely affect demand for our offerings retention rates and harm our business and results of operations particularly in light of the fact that our 

solutions are discretionary purchases and thus may be more susceptible to macroeconomic pressures  as well impact the value of our common stock our ability to refinance our debt and our access to capital 

the duration and extent of the impact from the covid19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately forecasted at this time such as the severity and transmission rate of the disease the extent and effectiveness of containment actions and the impact of these and other factors on our employees customers partners and thirdparty service providers for more information on the risks associated with the covid19 pandemic please see “risk factors” in item 1a 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap requires us to make estimates including judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

business combinations 

we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of purchase price requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in determining the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets 

critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships developed technology trade names and acquired patents and discount rates management estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

income taxes 

we are subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions we are required to estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess the temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes we apply judgment in the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes which includes the following critical accounting estimates 

we use a twostep process to recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any if we determine that the tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of various outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period 

loss contingencies 

we are subject to contingencies that expose us to losses including various legal and regulatory proceedings asserted and potential claims that arise in the ordinary course of business an estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and we may revise our estimates until the final resolution of such matters there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for that reporting period 

discontinued operations 

we review the presentation of planned business dispositions in the consolidated financial statements based on the available information and events that have occurred the review consists of evaluating whether the business meets the definition of a 

component for which the operations and cash flows are clearly distinguishable from the other components of the business and if so whether it is anticipated that after the disposal the cash flows of the component would be eliminated from continuing operations and whether the disposition represents a strategic shift that has a major effect on operations and financial results in addition we evaluate whether the business has met the criteria as a business held for sale in order for a planned disposition to be classified as a business held for sale the established criteria must be met as of the reporting date including an active program to market the business and the expected disposition of the business within one year 

planned business dispositions are presented as discontinued operations when all the criteria described above are met for those divestitures that qualify as discontinued operations all comparative periods presented are reclassified in the consolidated balance sheets additionally the results of operations of a discontinued operation are reclassified to income from discontinued operations net of tax for all periods presented results of discontinued operations include all revenues and expenses directly derived from such businesses general corporate overhead is not allocated to discontinued operations see note 3  divestiture and discontinued operations in our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

net revenues decreased 103 million primarily due to a 238 million decrease as a result of the divestiture of our website security wss and public key infrastructure pki solutions and 33 million decrease in revenue from our consumer security solutions partially offset by a 161 million increase in revenues of our identity and information protection solutions 

performance metrics 

we regularly monitor a number of metrics in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance our metrics may be calculated in a manner different than similar metrics used by other companies 

the following table summarizes supplemental key performance metrics for our solutions 





1 arpu in fiscal 2020 was normalized to exclude the impact of the extra week on direct revenue which we estimate to be approximately 41 million of direct customer revenue excluding this adjustment apru would have been 907 in fiscal 2020 

2 represents a nongaap financial measure estimated net revenue generated from direct customers during fiscal year 2018 used in the calculation of arpu excluded a reduction in revenue related to contract liability purchase accounting adjustments required by gaap as further discussed below 

we define direct customer revenues as revenues from sales of our consumer solutions to direct customers which we define as those customers who have a direct billing relationship with us such customer sources include online acquisition and retention affiliates comarketing and original equipment manufacturer channels direct customers excludes customers of our partners and our id analytics solutions and wss and pki solutions all of which have now been divested the excluded revenues are summarized in the following table 



average direct customer count presents the average of the total number of direct customers at the beginning and end of the fiscal year 

arpu is calculated as estimated direct customer revenues for the period divided by the average direct customer count for the same period expressed as a monthly figure nongaap fiscal 2018 estimated direct customer revenues used in the calculation of arpu is adjusted only to exclude a reduction in revenue of 60 million related to purchase accounting adjustments related to the february 2017 acquisition of lifelock inc arpu for fiscal 2018 would have been 799 without this adjustment we believe the adjustment is useful to investors to reflect arpu trends in our business by improving the comparability of arpu between periods fiscal 2020 and 2019 did not include any adjustments to estimated direct customer revenue as the purchase accounting adjustments were fully amortized prior to fiscal 2019 nongaap estimated direct customer revenues and arpu have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for gaap estimated direct customer revenues or other gaap measures we monitor apru because it helps us understand the rate at which we are monetizing our consumer customer base 

annual retention rate is defined as the number of direct customers who have more than a oneyear tenure as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal period divided by the total number of direct customers as of the end of the period from one year ago we monitor annual retention rate to evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies to improve renewals of subscriptions 

net revenues by geographic region 

percentage of revenue by geographic region as presented below is based on the billing location of the customer 





percentages may not add to 100 due to rounding 

the americas include us canada and latin america emea includes europe middle east and africa apj includes asia pacific and japan 

percentage of revenue by geographic region in fiscal 2020 was similar to fiscal 2019 americas revenues as a percentage of total revenues increased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 as a result of the sale of our wss and pki solutions which proportionally had more revenues in emea and apj than the remaining solutions and higher revenues from our identity and information protection solutions in us during fiscal 2019 

cost of revenues 



fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 

our cost of revenues decreased 62 million primarily due to decreases in technical support costs and service costs partially offset by an increase in royalty charges in addition during fiscal 2019 we recorded higher inventory writeoffs of 10 million due to our discontinuation of our consumer hardware product line 

fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 

our cost of revenues decreased 8 million primarily due to a 37 million decrease from the divestiture of our wss and pki solutions partially offset by higher inventory and royalty writeoffs due to our discontinuation of our consumer hardware product line in fiscal 2019 and higher fulfillment costs 

operating expenses 



fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 

sales and marketing expense decreased 11 million primarily due to a 75 million decrease in compensation expense and allocated corporate costs reflecting our cost reduction initiatives these decreases were partially offset by a 64 million increase in advertising and promotional expense reflecting our higher investments in direct marketing programs 

research and development expense decreased 92 million primarily due to a 77 million decrease in compensation expense and allocated corporate costs and a 23 million decrease in outside services reflecting our cost reduction initiatives 

general and administrative expense decreased 42 million primarily due to a 34 million decrease in compensation expense other than stockbased compensation and allocated corporate costs and a 18 million decrease in stockbased compensation expense 

amortization of intangible assets was relatively flat compared to fiscal 2019 

restructuring transition and other costs increased 45 million primarily due to 101 million of contract cancellation charges incurred in fiscal 2020 a 71 million increase in severance costs a 45 million increase in asset impairments and a 20 million increase in stockbased compensation these increases were partially offset by 185 million costs related to transition projects incurred in fiscal 2019 that were completed by the end of that period see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our restructuring plans 

fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018

restructuring transition and other costs decreased 159 million primarily due to a 75 million decrease in severance and other restructuring costs in addition fiscal 2018 costs included 88 million of transition related costs related to our fiscal 2018 divestiture of our wss and pki solutions compared to 3 million in fiscal 2019 

nonoperating income expense net 



fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 

nonoperating income net of expense increased 729 million primarily due to a 379 million gain on the sale of the digicert equity method investment and a 250 million gain on the sale of our id analytics solutions in fiscal 2020 in addition our loss from equity interest that was divested in fiscal 2020 decreased 70 million and our interest income increased 38 million as a result of higher investments in money market funds purchased with proceeds from the broadcom sale 

fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 

nonoperating income net of expense decreased 663 million primarily due to the absence of the 653 million gain on the divestiture of our wss and pki solutions in fiscal 2018 in addition our loss from our equity interest that was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 75 million  interest expense decreased 48 million as a result of lower outstanding borrowings during fiscal 2019 due to repayments 

provision for income taxes 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and international tax jurisdictions a substantial portion of our international earnings were generated from subsidiaries organized in ireland and singapore our results of operations would be adversely affected to the extent that our geographical mix of income becomes more weighted toward jurisdictions with higher tax rates and would be favorably affected to the extent the relative geographic mix shifts to lower tax jurisdictions any change in our mix of earnings is dependent upon many factors and is therefore difficult to predict 



fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 

our effective tax rate increased primarily due to an increase in income taxes from nondeductible goodwill and an increase in income taxes as a result of the altera ninth circuit opinion see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for information about the altera ninth circuit opinion 

fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2 018 

our effective tax rate increased primarily due to onetime benefits from tax cuts and jobs act hr1 the 2017 tax act in fiscal 2018 in addition increases in tax expense in fiscal 2019 are attributable to the valuation allowance on capital losses for which we cannot yet recognize a tax benefit 

discontinued operations 



fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 

income from discontinued operations in fiscal 2020 reflects a 5434 million gain on the broadcom sale and 2122 million income tax expense primarily related to the gain in addition we recognized 261 million restructuring transition and other costs in fiscal 2020 compared to 20 million in fiscal 2019 

fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 

income from discontinued operations decreased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher income tax expense as we had higher foreign tax benefit and stockbased compensation windfalls in fiscal 2018 

liquidity capital resources and cash requirements 

liquidity 

we have historically relied on cash generated from operations borrowings under credit facilities issuances of debt and proceeds from divestitures for our liquidity needs 

as of april 3 2020  we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 23 billion  of which 09 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are managed with the objective to preserve principal maintain liquidity and generate investment returns the participation exemption system under current us federal tax regulations generally allows us to make distributions of nonus earnings to the us without incurring additional us federal tax however these distributions may be subject to applicable state or nonus taxes we have recognized deferred income taxes for local country income and withholding taxes that could be incurred on distributions of certain nonus earnings or for outside basis differences in our subsidiaries 

we also have an undrawn revolving credit facility of 10 billion which expires in november 2024 

our principal cash requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs and support ongoing business activities including payment of taxes and cash dividends funding capital expenditures servicing existing debt repurchasing our common stock and investing in business acquisitions 

our capital allocation strategy is to balance driving stockholder returns managing financial risk and preserving our flexibility to pursue strategic options including acquisitions historically this has included a quarterly cash dividend the repayment of debt and the repurchase of our common stock

accounts receivable decreased 583 million  primarily due to the collections of receivables related to our enterprise security solutions such receivables were not included in the assets that were sold in connection with the broadcom sale 

contract liabilities decreased 121 million  primarily due to seasonally higher recognized revenue from our enterprise security solutions than billings during the period prior to the broadcom sale 

accrued compensation and benefits decreased 117 million  primarily due to a decrease in headcount as a result of the broadcom sale and our restructuring activities 

income taxes payable increased 383 million primarily due to taxes owed on the broadcom sale and the sale of our digicert equity method investment during fiscal 2020 we made aggregate tax payments of 2 billion related to these transactions

changes in operating assets and liabilities during fiscal 2018 consisted primarily of the following 

accounts receivable increased 170 million  reflecting higher billings in the last months of fiscal 2018 and our shift in sales to solutions with ratable revenue recognition related to our enterprise security solutions 

contract liabilities increased 491 million  reflecting our shift in sales to contracts related to our enterprise security solutions with longer durations subject to ratable versus point in time revenue recognition this resulted in less inperiod revenue recognized and higher billings towards the end of the fiscal year due to the seasonal sales cycles for those solutions these factors were primarily offset by a decrease of 319 million related to our fiscal 2018 divestiture of our wss and pki solutions 

income taxes payable increased 880 million  reflecting the onetime transition tax of 896 million under the 2017 tax act

contractual obligations 

the following is a schedule of our significant contractual obligations as of april 3 2020  including those associated with our discontinued operations the expected timing of payments of the obligations in the following table is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 





 due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits and other longterm taxes as of april 3 2020  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities therefore 695 million in longterm income taxes payable has been excluded from the contractual obligations table see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

indemnifications 

in the ordinary course of business we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers vendors lessors business partners subsidiaries and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of agreements or representations and warranties made by us in connection with the sale of veritas and the sale of our enterprise security business to broadcom we assigned several leases to veritas technologies llc or broadcom andor their related subsidiaries r efer to note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our indemnifications 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies we do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

our shortterm investments and cash equivalents primarily consist of corporate bonds and certificate of deposits respectively a change in interest could have an adverse impact on their market value as of april 3 2020  the carrying value and fair value of our shortterm investments and cash equivalents was 434 million  a hypothetical change in the yield curve of 100 basis points would not result in a significant reduction in fair value 

as of april 3 2020  we had 38 billion in aggregate principal amount of fixedrate senior notes and convertible debt outstanding with a carrying amount and a fair value of 36 billion  based on level 2 inputs since these notes bear interest at fixed rates they do not result in any financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change 

as of april 3 2020  we also had 500 million outstanding debt with variable interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate libor a reasonably possible hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points in libor would not result in a significant increase in interest expense on an annualized basis 

in addition we have a 10 billion revolving credit facility that if drawn bears interest at a variable rate based on libor and would be subject to the same risks associated with adverse changes in libor 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we conduct business in numerous currencies through our worldwide operations and our entities hold monetary assets or liabilities earn revenues or incur costs in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency primarily in euro japanese yen british pound and indian rupee in addition we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services we provide our cash flow results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities as a result we are exposed to foreign exchange gains or losses which impacts our operating results 

we have a foreign exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures manage these exposures and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our results of operations through which we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries with up to twelve months in duration we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of the changes in foreign exchange rates the gains and losses on these foreign exchange contracts are recorded in interest and other net in our statement of operations 

as of april 3 2020 and march 29 2019  we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of 419 million and  11 billion  respectively to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposure with an insignificant fair value a hypothetical ten percent depreciation of foreign currency would result in a reduction in fair value of our forward contracts of 30 million and 84 million for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 respectively this analysis disregards the possibilities that the rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area

 item 1a risk factors 

a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below the list is not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock 

a decrease in demand for our solutions could adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to fluctuations in demand for our solutions due to a variety of factors including market transitions general economic conditions competition product obsolescence technological change shifts in buying patterns the timing and duration of hardware refresh cycles financial difficulties and budget constraints of our current and potential customers public awareness of security threats to it systems and other factors while such factors may in some periods increase product sales fluctuations in demand can also negatively impact our sales if demand for our solutions declines whether due to general economic conditions a shift in buying patterns or otherwise our revenues and margins would likely be adversely affected 

fluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected the trading price of our outstanding securities in the past and could affect the trading price of our outstanding securities in the future 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary in the future due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts and investors the trading price of our outstanding securities could be negatively affected volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or  pursue acquisitions our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance 

factors associated with our industry the operation of our business and the markets for our solutions may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate including but not limited to 

 any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of our outstanding securities to fluctuate significantly 

our business depends on customers renewing their arrangements for maintenance subscriptions managed security services and cloudbased cloud offerings 

a large portion of our enterprise security revenue is derived from arrangements for maintenance subscriptions managed security services and cloud offerings yet customers have no contractual obligation to purchase additional solutions after the initial subscription or contract period in particular termbased license subscriptions and cloudbased products are increasing as 

a percentage of our total revenues while we believe our customers’ renewal rates in general have been relatively stable in recent periods customer retention and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including our customers’ level of satisfaction with our solutions or our customer support customer budgets and the pricing of our solutions compared with the solutions offered by our competitors any of which may cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected or to decline accordingly we must invest significant time and resources in providing ongoing value to our customers if these efforts fail if our customers do not renew for other reasons or if our customers renew on terms less favorable to us our revenue may decline and our business will suffer 

if we are unable to develop new and enhanced solutions that achieve widespread market acceptance or if we are unable to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our existing solutions or adapt our business model to keep pace with industry trends our competitive position may weaken and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our future success depends on our ability to effectively respond to the rapidly changing needs of our customers as well as competitive technological developments and industry changes by developing or introducing new and enhanced solutions on a timely basis 

we have in the past incurred and will continue to incur significant research and development expenses as we strive to remain competitive if we are unable to anticipate or react to competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a decline in our sales that could adversely affect our business and operating results additionally we must continually address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends and competitive developments such as the emergence of advanced persistent threats in the security space the continued volatility in the pc market the market shift towards mobility and the increasing transition towards subscription and cloudbased solutions all of which continue to make it more difficult for us to compete effectively for example although we have been investing heavily in solutions that address the cloud security market we cannot be certain that it will develop at a rate or in the manner we expect or that we will be able to compete successfully with new entrants or more established competitors customers may require features and capabilities that our current solutions do not have our failure to develop new solutions and improve our existing solutions that satisfy customer preferences and effectively compete with other market offerings   in a timely and costeffective manner may harm our ability to renew our subscriptions with existing customers and to create or increase demand for our solutions which may adversely impact our operating results the development and introduction of new solutions involves a significant commitment of time and resources and are subject to a number of risks and challenges including but not limited to 

 if we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges or if our new or improved solutions are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees lose key personnel fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully or fail to manage our employee base effectively we may be unable to develop new and enhanced solutions effectively manage or expand our business or increase our revenues 

our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key management technical including cybersecurity experts sales marketing finance and other personnel our officers and other key personnel are employeesatwill and we generally do not have employment or noncompete agreements with our employees and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them competition for people with the specific skills that we require is significant especially in and around our headquarters in the silicon valley and we face difficulties in attracting retaining and motivating employees as a result in order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace we must provide competitive pay packages including cash and equitybased compensation additionally changes in immigration laws could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business results of operations and future growth prospects could suffer the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees in addition we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number of shares required for issuance under our equity compensation plans as a result we may issue fewer equitybased incentives and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees or conversely if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution from time to time key personnel leave our company and the frequency and number of such departures has widely varied and have resulted in significant changes to our executive leadership team for example we are initiating a chief executive officer transition process and appointed an interim president and chief executive officer additionally our chief operating officer resigned in november 2018 and as previously disclosed our chief financial officer is stepping down and is being replaced by a new chief financial officer as of the date hereof although we strive to reduce the negative impact of changes in our leadership the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures our internal control over financial reporting and our results of operations in addition hiring training and successfully integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time consuming and expensive may cause additional disruptions to our operations and may be unsuccessful which could negatively impact future financial results 

we operate in a highly competitive environment and our competitors may gain market share in the markets for our solutions that could adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to decline 

we operate in intensely competitive markets that experience rapid technological developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements if we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a decline in our sales that could adversely affect our business and operating results to compete successfully we must maintain an innovative research and development effort to develop new solutions and enhance our existing solutions effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors appropriately respond to competitive strategies and effectively adapt to technological changes and changes in the ways that our information is accessed used and stored by our customers if we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors or to changing technological and customer demands our competitive position and our financial results could be adversely affected 

our competitors include software and cloudbased vendors that offer solutions that directly compete with our offerings in addition to competing with these vendors directly for sales to endusers of our solutions we compete with them for the opportunity to have our solutions bundled with the offerings of our strategic partners such as computer hardware original equipment manufacturers oems and internet service providers isps our competitors could gain market share from us if any of these strategic partners replace our solutions with those of our competitors or if these partners more actively promote our competitors’ solutions than our own in addition software and cloudbased vendors who have bundled our solutions with theirs may choose to bundle their solutions with their own or other vendors’ solutions or may limit our access to standard interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop solutions for their platform in the future further product development by these vendors could cause our solutions to become redundant which could significantly impact our sales and financial results 

we face growing competition from network equipment computer hardware manufacturers large operating system providers and other technology companies as well as from companies in the identity threat protection space such as credit bureaus many of these competitors are increasingly developing and incorporating into their products data protection software that competes at some levels with our offerings our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our solutions 

security protection is also offered by some of our competitors at prices lower than our prices or in some cases is offered free of charge some companies offer lowerpriced or free security products within their computer hardware or software products our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive these lower cost or free security products as replacing the need for more effective full featured solutions such as those that we provide the expansion of these competitive trends could have a significant negative impact on our sales and operating results by causing among other things price reductions of our solutions reduced profitability and loss of market share 

many of our competitors have greater financial technical sales marketing or other resources than we do and consequently may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their products instead of ours further consolidation within our industry or other changes in the competitive environment could result in larger competitors that compete with us on several levels we also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the markets in which we compete 

our cloud offerings present execution and competitive risks 

our cloud offerings are critical to our business our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud offerings for consumers and business customers pricing and delivery models are evolving devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud we have made and are continuing to make significant investments in and devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own cloud strategies we cannot assure you that our ongoing investments in and development of our cloud infrastructure and related cloud offerings will achieve the expected returns for us or that we will be able to compete successfully in the marketplace in addition to software development costs we are incurring significant costs to build execute upon and maintain the infrastructure needed to support our cloud offerings these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we are successful in this business model depends on our execution in a number of areas including 



 we invest in research and development activities in both the short and long term and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results 

while we continue to focus on managing our costs and expenses we also continue to invest significantly in research and development activities in both the short and long term as we focus on organic growth through internal innovation in each of our business segments we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position and that the level of these investments will increase in future periods we recognize the costs associated with these research and development investments earlier than the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuance of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairments 

in response to changes in industry structure and market conditions we may be required to strategically reallocate our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting certain businesses any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel reschedule or adjust with contract manufacturers and suppliers 

further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to evaluate goodwill impairment on an annual basis and between annual evaluations in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment evaluations may result in a charge to earnings 

matters relating to or arising from our completed audit committee investigation including regulatory investigations and proceedings litigation matters and potential additional expenses may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

as previously disclosed in our public filings the audit committee completed its internal investigation in september 2018 in connection with the audit committee investigation we voluntarily contacted the sec the sec commenced a formal investigation and we continue to cooperate with that investigation the outcome of such an investigation is difficult to predict if the sec commences legal action we could be required to pay significant penalties and become subject to injunctions a cease and desist order and other equitable remedies we can provide no assurances as to the outcome of any governmental investigation 

we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses related to legal and other professional services in connection with the ongoing sec investigation which may continue to adversely affect our business and financial condition in addition securities class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against us our directors and officers see also “we are subject to pending securities class action and stockholder derivative legal proceedings   ” below the outcome of the securities class actions and other litigation and regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions is difficult to predict and the cost to defend settle or otherwise resolve these matters may be significant plaintiffs or regulatory agencies or authorities in these matters may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts or seek to impose sanctions including significant monetary penalties the monetary and other impact of these litigations proceedings or actions may remain unknown for substantial periods of time further an unfavorable resolution of litigations proceedings or actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and cash flows any future investigations or additional lawsuits may also adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to pending securities class action and stockholder derivative legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business 

several securities class action and purported derivative lawsuits have been filed against us arising out of the announcement of the audit committee investigation in addition we have received demands from purported stockholders to inspect corporate books and records under delaware law no specific amounts of damages have been alleged in these lawsuits we will continue to incur legal fees in connection with these pending cases including expenses for the reimbursement of legal fees of present and former officers and directors under indemnification obligations the expense of continuing to defend such litigation may be significant we intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any defense if any of the lawsuits related to our audit committee investigation are decided adversely we may be liable for significant damages directly or under our indemnification obligations which could adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows further the amount of time that will be required to resolve these lawsuits is unpredictable and these actions may divert management’s attention from the daytoday operations of our business which could further adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows 

the delayed filing of some of our periodic sec reports has made us currently ineligible to use a registration statement on form s3 to register the offer and sale of securities which could adversely affect our ability to raise future capital or complete acquisitions 

as a result of the delayed filing of some of our periodic reports with the sec in connection with the completed audit committee investigation we will not be eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on form s3 until december 2019 at the earliest registering the offer and sale of our securities prior to the time we are eligible to use form s3 may increase our transaction costs and the amount of time required to complete the transaction could increase making it more difficult to execute any such transaction successfully and potentially harming our financial condition 

our indemnification obligations and limitations of our director and officer liability insurance may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

under delaware law our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and certain indemnification agreements to which we are a party we have an obligation to indemnify or we have otherwise agreed to indemnify certain of our current and former directors and officers with respect to past current and future investigations and litigation 

the scope of our indemnification obligations may be broader than the coverage available under our directors’ and officers’ liability insurance or there may be insufficient coverage available further in the event the directors and officers are ultimately determined not to be entitled to indemnification we may not be able to recover any amounts we previously advanced to them 

we cannot provide any assurances that future indemnification claims including the cost of fees penalties or other expenses will not exceed the limits of our insurance policies that such claims are covered by the terms of our insurance policies or that our insurance carrier will be able to cover such claims further should a coverage dispute arise we may also incur significant expenses in relation to litigating or attempting to resolve any such dispute accordingly we may incur significant unreimbursed costs to satisfy our indemnification obligations which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully 

the intense competition we face in addition to general and economic business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain solutions or develop products or support offerings that the marketplace considers more valuable we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully any such changes may reduce margins and could adversely affect our operating results 

in addition a weakening of economic conditions or significant uncertainty regarding the stability of financial markets could adversely impact our business financial condition and operating results in a number of ways impacts could include longer sales cycles pressure to lower prices for our solutions a reduction in the rate of adoption of our solutions by new customers and a lower rate of current customers purchasing upgrades to our current solutions 

any broadbased change to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies we or our competitors may bundle solutions for promotional purposes or as a longterm gotomarket or pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our offerings 

defects disruptions or risks related to our cloud offerings could impair our ability to deliver our services and could expose us to liability damage our brand and reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business 

our cloud offerings may contain errors or defects that users identify after they begin using them that could result in unanticipated service interruptions which could harm our reputation and our business since our customers use our cloud offerings for missioncritical protection from threats to electronic information endpoint devices and computer networks any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems with our cloud offerings could significantly harm our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses if any such performance problems occur customers could elect not to renew or delay or withhold payment to us we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts or warranty an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation 

we currently serve our cloudbased customers from hosting facilities including thirdparty hosting facilities located across the globe damage to or failure of any significant element of these hosting facilities could result in interruptions in our service which could harm our customers and expose us to liability  the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in the delivery of our solutions  global climate change may result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity such as drought wildfires storms sealevel rise and flooding interruptions or failures in our service delivery could cause customers to terminate their subscriptions with us could adversely affect our renewal rates and could harm our ability to attract new customers our business would also be harmed if our customers believe that our cloud offerings are unreliable 

our solutions are complex and operate in a wide variety of environments systems applications and configurations which could result in failures of our solutions to function as designed 

because we offer very complex solutions undetected errors failures or bugs may occur especially when solutions are first introduced or when new versions are released our products are often installed and used in largescale computing environments with different operating systems system management software and equipment and networking configurations which may cause errors or failures in our solutions or may expose undetected errors failures or bugs in our solutions our customers’ 

computing environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and nonstandard configurations that make prerelease testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and timeconsuming in addition despite testing by us and others errors failures or bugs may not be found in new solutions or releases until after they are delivered to customers in the past we have discovered software errors failures and bugs in certain of our solutions after their introduction and in some cases have experienced delayed or lost revenues as a result of these errors 

errors failures or bugs in solutions released by us could result in negative publicity damage to our brand and reputation returns loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products loss of competitive position or claims by customers or others many of our enduser customers use our solutions in applications that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects in our solutions than to defects in other less critical software products in addition if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity security or availability occurs in one of our enduser customer’s systems regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our solutions could be harmed alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions delays or cessation of our licensing which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating results 

our products solutions cloud offerings systems and website may be subject to intentional disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future sales 

despite our precautions and significant ongoing investments to protect against security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and other intentional disruptions of our solutions we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance and availability of our offerings and harm our reputation as a company similarly experienced computer programmers or other sophisticated individuals or entities including malicious hackers statesponsored organizations and insider threats including actions by employees and thirdparty service providers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our systems and websites and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services including the operation of our global civilian cyber intelligence threat network such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication and if successful could expose us and the affected parties to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of our business operations while we invest and devote significant resources to maintain and continually enhance and update our methods to detect and alert us to such breaches attacks and disruptions these efforts may not be sufficient even with rapid detection to prevent the damage such a breach of our products solutions cloud offerings systems and websites may cause 

our inability to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity event could impair our ability to deliver our products and services and harm our business 

we are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure to provide our products and services to our customers for example we host many of our products using thirdparty data center facilities and we do not control the operation of these facilities these facilities are vulnerable to damage interruption or performance problems from earthquakes hurricanes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they are also subject to breakins computer viruses sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in the delivery of our products and services 

furthermore our business administration human resources and finance services depend on the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations a disruption or failure of these systems or operations because of a disaster or other business continuity event could cause data to be lost or otherwise delay our ability to complete sales and provide the highest level of service to our customers in addition we could have difficulty producing accurate financial statements on a timely basis and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting which may impact our ability to certify our financial results all of which could adversely affect the trading value of our stock although we endeavor to ensure there is redundancy in these systems and that they are regularly backedup there are no assurances that data recovery in the event of a disaster would be effective or occur in an efficient manner including the operation of our global civilian cyber intelligence threat network   if these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions 

any errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our products and services could harm our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses for example we may experience disruptions outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors including infrastructure changes human or software errors capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our websites simultaneously fraud or security attacks in some instances we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time interruptions in our products and services including the operation of our global civilian cyber intelligence threat network could impact our revenues or cause customers to cease doing business with us in addition our business would be harmed if any of the events of this nature caused our customers and potential customers to believe our services are unreliable our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we could potentially lose customer data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario 

we collect use disclose store or otherwise process personal information which subjects us to privacy and data security laws and contractual commitments and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and commitments could harm our business 

we collect use store or disclose collectively process an increasingly large amount of personal information including from employees and customers in connection with the operation of our business particularly in relation to our identity and information protection offerings we process an increasingly high volume variety and velocity of personal information as a result of our identity and information protection offerings that rely on large data repositories of personal information and consumer transactions the personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal state local and foreign laws regarding privacy and data security as well as contractual commitments any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions fines litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business   

additionally changes to applicable privacy or data security laws could impact how we process personal information and therefore limit the effectiveness of our solutions or our ability to develop new solutions  for example the european union general data protection regulation imposes more stringent data protection requirements and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of €20 million or four percent of worldwide annual revenues 

data protection legislation is also becoming increasingly common in the us at both the federal and state level for example in june 2018 the state of california enacted the california consumer privacy act of 2018 the ccpa which will come into effect on january 1 2020 the ccpa requires companies that process information on california residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection use and sharing practices allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches however california legislators have stated that they intend to propose amendments to the ccpa and it remains unclear what if any modifications will be made to the ccpa or how it will be interpreted additionally the federal trade commission the ftc and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection use dissemination and security of data the burdens imposed by the ccpa and other similar laws that may be enacted at the federal and state level may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial expenditures in order to comply 

global privacy and data protection legislation enforcement and policy activity are rapidly expanding and evolving and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  we may be or become subject to data localization laws mandating that data collected in a foreign country be processed and stored only within that country if any country in which we have customers were to adopt a data localization law we could be required to expand our data storage facilities there or build new ones in order to comply the expenditure this would require as well as costs of compliance generally could harm our financial condition 

additionally third parties with whom we work such as vendors or developers may violate applicable laws or our policies and such violations can place personal information of our customers at risk in addition o ur customers may also accidentally disclose their passwords or store them on a device that is lost or stolen creating the perception that our systems are not secure against thirdparty access this could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business in addition such third parties could be the target of cyberattack and other data breaches which could impact our systems or our customers’ records 

our acquisitions and divestitures create special risks and challenges that could adversely affect our financial results 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire or divest businesses or assets these activities can involve a number of risks and challenges including 

 we have invested and continue to invest and devote significant resources in the integration of businesses we acquire the success of each acquisition depends in part on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities including certain cost savings and operational efficiencies or synergies and growth prospects from integrating these businesses in an efficient and effective manner if integration of our acquired businesses is not successful we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects to integrate acquired businesses we must integrate and manage the personnel and 

business systems of the acquired operations we also must effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired business organizations into our own in a way that aligns various interests and we may need to enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions moreover to be successful large complex acquisitions depend on largescale product technology and sales force integrations that are difficult to complete on a timely basis or at all and may be more susceptible to the special risks and challenges described above 

in addition we have in the past and may in the future divest businesses product lines or assets such initiatives may require significant separation activities that could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention loss of employees substantial separation costs and accounting charges for asset impairments 

any of the foregoing and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability or other financial benefits from our acquired or divested businesses product lines or assets or to realize other anticipated benefits of divestitures or acquisitions 

if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively or if our partners choose not to market and sell our solutions to their customers our operating results could be adversely affected 

we sell our solutions to customers around the world through multitiered sales and distribution networks 

sales through these different channels involve distinct risks including the following 

direct sales  a portion of our revenues from enterprise products is derived from sales by our direct sales force to endusers risks associated with direct sales include 

 indirect sales channels  a portion of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels including but not limited to distributors that sell our products to endusers and other resellers this channel involves a number of risks including 

 oem sales channels a portion of our revenues is derived from sales through our oem partners that incorporate our products into or bundle our products with their products our reliance on this sales channel involves many risks including 



 if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels successfully these channels may conflict with one another or otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate which could reduce our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our competitive position some of our distribution partners have experienced financial difficulties in the past and if our partners suffer financial difficulties in the future because of general economic conditions or for other reasons these partners may delay paying their obligations to us and we may have reduced revenues or collections that could adversely affect our operating results in addition reliance on multiple channels subjects us to events that could cause unpredictability in demand which could increase the risk that we may be unable to plan effectively for the future and could adversely affect our operating results   

we face heightened regulation in our consumer cyber safety segment which could impede our ability to market and provide our solutions or adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

we are subject to heightened regulation in our consumer cyber safety segment as a result of the sale of our identity and information protection products which we sell as a result of our acquisition of lifelock including a wide variety of federal state and local laws and regulations including the fair credit reporting act the grammleachbliley act the federal trade commission act ftc act and comparable state laws that are patterned after the ftc act moreover lifelock entered into consent decrees and similar arrangements with the ftc and 35 states’ attorneys general in 2010 and a settlement with the ftc in 2015 relating to allegations that certain of lifelock’s advertising and marketing practices constituted deceptive acts or practices in violation of the ftc act which impose additional restrictions on the lifelock business including prohibitions against making any misrepresentation of “the means methods procedures effects effectiveness coverage or scope of” lifelock’s identity theft protection services any of the laws and regulations that apply to our business are subject to revision or new or changed interpretations and we cannot predict the impact of such changes on our business 

additionally the nature of our identity and information protection products subjects us to the broad regulatory supervisory and enforcement powers of the consumer financial protection bureau which may exercise authority with respect to our services or the marketing and servicing of those services by overseeing our financial institution or credit reporting agency customers and suppliers or by otherwise exercising its supervisory regulatory or enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services 

our international operations involve risks that could increase our expenses adversely affect our operating results and require increased time and attention of our management 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the us and we have significant operations outside of the us including engineering sales customer support and production our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations including 



a significant portion of our transactions outside of the us is denominated in foreign currencies accordingly our revenues and expenses will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates we have in the past and expect in the future to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates especially if international sales grow as a percentage of our total sales or our operations outside the us continue to increase 

for example the united kingdom’s uk planned exit from the european union eu brexit has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets and will likely have an adverse impact on labor and trade in addition to creating further shortterm uncertainty and currency volatility in the absence of a future trade deal the uk’s trade with the european union and the rest of the world would be subject to tariffs and duties set by the world trade organization any adjustments we make to our business and operations as a result of brexit could result in significant time and expense to complete while we have not experienced any material financial impact from brexit on our business to date we cannot predict its future implications any impact from brexit on our business and operations over the long term will depend in part on the outcome of tariff tax treaties trade regulatory and other negotiations the uk conducts 

if we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology our financial results could be harmed 

most of our software and underlying technology is proprietary we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws however these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties third parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise obtain use distribute and sell our proprietary information without authorization 

third parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently by designing around our patents our shrinkwrap license agreements are not signed by licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions furthermore the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the us and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries the unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could adversely affect our ability to access software operating system and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor or cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products to their customers in addition any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in could be costly may distract management from daytoday operations and may lead to additional claims against us which could adversely affect our operating results 

from time to time we are a party to lawsuits and investigations which typically require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses and which could negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have initiated and been named as a party to lawsuits including patent litigation class actions and governmental claims and we may be named in additional litigation the expense of initiating and defending and in some cases settling such litigation may be costly and divert management’s attention from the daytoday operations of our business which could adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows in addition an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could result in significant fines settlements monetary damages or injunctive relief that could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business results of operations and cash flows 

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

from time to time third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights including claims regarding patents copyrights and trademarks because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that the number of these claims may grow in addition former employers of our former current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us confidential or proprietary information of these former employers any such claim with or without merit could result in costly litigation and distract management from daytoday operations if we are not successful in defending such claims we could be required to stop selling delay shipments of or redesign our products pay monetary amounts as damages enter into royalty or licensing arrangements or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers we cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to investigate defend and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

in addition we license and use software from third parties in our business these thirdparty software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and may expose us to additional liability this liability or our inability to use any of this thirdparty software could result in delivery delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

changes to our effective tax rate could increase our income tax expense and reduce increase our net income loss 

our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

 we report our results of operations based on our determination of the aggregate amount of taxes owed in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate from time to time we receive notices that a tax authority in a particular jurisdiction believes that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority we are regularly engaged in discussions and sometimes disputes with these tax authorities if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we cannot predict our future capital needs and we may be unable to obtain financing which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

adverse economic conditions or a change in our business performance may make it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations investing activities including potential acquisitions or divestitures or financing activities any required financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all if we raise additional funds by obtaining loans from third parties the terms of those financing arrangements may include negative covenants or other restrictions on our business that could impair our financial or operational flexibility and would also require us to fund additional interest expense if additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to successfully develop or enhance our software and services through acquisitions in order to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures which could have a material adverse effect on our software and services offerings revenues results of operations and financial condition 

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity capital position ability to hedge certain financial risks borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

our credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies and such agencies have in the past and could in the future downgrade our ratings we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position ability to hedge certain financial risks and access to capital markets in addition changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could increase the interest we pay on outstanding or future debt 

there are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness that could adversely affect our financial condition 

as of march 29 2019 we had an aggregate of 45 billion  of outstanding indebtedness that will mature in calendar years 2020 through 2025 including approximately 40 billion in aggregate principal amount of existing senior notes and 05 billion  of outstanding term loans under our senior credit facilities and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future andor enter into new financing arrangements in addition as of march 29 2019 we had 10 billion available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility our ability to meet expenses to remain in compliance with the covenants under our debt instruments and to pay interest and repay principal for our substantial level of indebtedness depends on among other things our operating performance competitive developments and financial market conditions all of which are significantly affected by financial business economic and other factors we are not able to control many of these factors accordingly our cash flow may not be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt including the notes and meet our other obligations 

our level of indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 



 there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully 

in addition we conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries which are generally not guarantors of our debt accordingly repayment of our indebtedness will be dependent in part on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise in general our subsidiaries will not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our debt or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make the  required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our existing credit agreements impose operating and financial restrictions on us 

the existing credit agreements contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to 

 all of these covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance our operations meet or otherwise address our capital needs pursue business opportunities react to market conditions or otherwise restrict activities or business plans a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness if a default occurs the relevant lenders could elect to declare the indebtedness together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable and to the extent such indebtedness is secured in the future proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness 

some of our products contain “open source” software and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business 

certain of our products are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under socalled “open source” licenses which may include by way of example the gnu general public license gnu lesser general public license the mozilla public license the bsd license and the apache license 

some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use by the terms of certain open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner in addition to risks related to license requirements usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software we have established processes to help alleviate these risks including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products in addition many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated and could if not properly addressed negatively affect our business 

our contracts with the us government include compliance audit and review obligations any failure to meet these obligations could result in civil damages andor penalties being assessed against us by the government 

we sell products and services through government contracting programs directly and via partners though we no longer hold a gsa contract in the ordinary course of business sales under these government contracting programs may be subject to audit or investigation by the us government noncompliance identified as a result of such reviews as well as noncompliance identified on our own could subject us to damages and other penalties which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition

fiscal calendar and basis of presentation 

we have a 5253week fiscal year ending on the friday closest to march 31 fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 in this report refers to fiscal year ended march 29 2019  march 30 2018  and march 31 2017  respectively each of which was a 52week year 

our financial results for fiscal 2019 are presented in accordance with the new revenue standard that was adopted under the modified retrospective method at the beginning of fiscal 2019 prior period results have not been restated refer to note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further details about our recent adoption of this accounting guidance  

key financial metrics 

the following table provides our key financial metrics for fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 





critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap requires us to make estimates including judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue primarily pursuant to the requirements under the authoritative guidance on contracts with customers revenue recognition requirements are very complex and require us to make estimates and assumptions 

we enter into arrangements with multiple performance obligations which may include hardware software licenses cloud services support and maintenance and professional services we allocate revenue to each performance obligation on a relative fair value basis based on management’s estimate of standalone selling price ssp judgments are required to determine the ssp for each performance obligation the determination of ssp is made by taking into consideration observable prices in historical transactions when observable prices in historical transactions are not available or are inconsistent we estimate ssp based on observable prices in historical transactions of similar products pricing discount practices product margins and other factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation changes to the performance obligations in an arrangement the judgments required to estimate the ssp for the respective performance obligations and increasing variability in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition 

valuation of goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets 

business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill goodwill is allocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination the allocation of purchase price requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in determining the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets 

critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships developed technology trade names and acquired patents and discount rates management estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

income taxes 

we are subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions we are required to estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess the temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes we apply judgment in the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes which includes the following critical accounting estimates 

we use a twostep process to recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any if we determine that the tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of various outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period 

as of december 28 2018 we have completed our accounting for the effects of the enactment of the 2017 tax act in accordance with us securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 118 and the amounts are no longer considered provisional we continue to evaluate any new guidance from the us department of treasury and the irs as issued 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award we recognize stockbased compensation cost over the award’s requisite service period on a straightline basis except for performancebased restricted stock units prus with graded vesting which we recognize on a graded basis for awards with performance conditions the amount of compensation cost we recognize over the requisite service period is based on the actual achievement of the performance condition or management’s best estimate of the achievement if not yet known no compensation cost is ultimately recognized for forfeited awards in which employees do not render the requisite service we estimate the number of stockbased awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover our forfeiture assumption is primarily based on historical experience 

the fair value of each restricted stock unit rsu and pru that does not contain a market condition is equal to the market value of our common stock on the date of grant the fair value of each pru that contains a market condition is estimated using the monte carlo simulation option pricing model the fair values of rsus and prus are not discounted by the dividend yield because our rsus and prus are entitled to dividend equivalents to be paid in the form of cash upon vesting for each share of the underlying unit 

we use the blackscholes model to determine the fair value of unvested stock options assumed in acquisitions the determination of the fair value of awards using the blackscholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables if the acquired companies lack sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term we estimate the expected life of assumed options using the “simplified method” for vested options this represents the midpoint between the valuation date and the contractual term for unvested options this represents the midpoint between the average vesting time and full contractual term expected volatility is based on the average of historical volatility over the most recent period commensurate with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of traded options the riskfree interest rate is equal to the us treasury rates for the period equal to the expected life the options assumed are without dividend equivalents and their fair values are discounted by our dividend yield 

we will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stockbased compensation on a prospective basis as we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock we may have refinements to our estimates which could materially impact our future stockbased compensation expense 

loss contingencies 

we are subject to contingencies that expose us to losses including various legal and regulatory proceedings asserted and potential claims that arise in the ordinary course of business an estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and we may revise our estimates until the final resolution of such matters there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for that reporting period 

results of operations 

pursuant to instruction 1 of the instructions to paragraph 303a of regulation sk discussion of the results of operations from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2017 has been omitted such omitted discussion can be found under item 7 of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended march 30 2018 filed with the commission on october 26 2018 

fiscal 2019  compared to fiscal 2018 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 





note the percentages may not add due to rounding 

net revenues 



net revenues decreased primarily due to a 231 million  decrease from our enterprise security segment as a result of the divestiture of our wss and pki solutions partially offset by an increase of 128 million  from our consumer cyber safety segment the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard had a favorable impact of 47 million on our fiscal 2019 revenues 

net revenues by geographical region 

percentage of revenue by geographic region as presented below is based on the billing location of the customer 





percentages may not add to 100 due to rounding 

the americas include us canada and latin america emea includes europe middle east and africa apj includes asia pacific and japan 

cost of revenues 



our cost of revenues increased primarily due to a 51 million increase in our consumer cyber safety segment partially offset by a 37 million decrease from the divestiture of our wss and pki solutions 

operating expenses 



sales and marketing expense decreased primarily due to a 51 million  decrease in stockbased compensation expense and a 41 million decrease as a result of the divestiture of our wss and pki solutions 

research and development expense decreased primarily due to a 66 million  decrease in stockbased compensation expense 

general and administrative expense decreased primarily due to a 130 million  decrease in stockbased compensation expense 

amortization of intangible assets decreased primarily due to the intangible assets sold with the divestiture of wss and pki solutions 

restructuring transition and other costs reflect a decrease of 70 million  in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 in severance and other restructuring costs in addition fiscal 2018 costs included 88 million of transition related costs related to our fiscal 2018 divestiture of our wss and pki solutions compared to 3 million in fiscal 2019 

nonoperating income expense net 



nonoperating income expense net decreased primarily due to the absence of the fiscal 2018 653 million  gain on the divestiture of our wss and pki solutions in addition our loss from our equity interest received in connection with the divestiture of our wss and pki solutions increased 75 million  which was partially offset by a 48 million  decrease in interest expense as a result of lower outstanding borrowings due to repayments 

provision for income taxes 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and international tax jurisdictions a substantial portion of our international earnings were generated from subsidiaries organized in ireland and singapore our results of operations would be adversely affected to the extent that our geographical mix of income becomes more weighted toward jurisdictions with higher tax rates and would be favorably affected to the extent the relative geographic mix shifts to lower tax jurisdictions any change in our mix of earnings is dependent upon many factors and is therefore difficult to predict 



the increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to onetime benefits from the 2017 tax act in fiscal 2018 in addition increases in tax expense in fiscal 2019 are attributable to the valuation allowance on capital losses for which we cannot yet recognize a tax benefit 

segment operating results 

we do not allocate certain operating expenses to our operating segments that we manage separately at the corporate level and that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments these unallocated expenses primarily consist of stockbased compensation expense amortization of intangible assets restructuring transition and other costs and acquisitionrelated costs in all periods presented see note 15  for more information 

enterprise security segment 



revenue decreased primarily due to a 238 million  decrease as a result of the fiscal 2018 divestiture of our wss and pki solutions partially offset by a 47 million favorable impact from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard operating income decreased primarily due to the divestiture of our wss and pki solutions which contributed 141 million to segment operating income in fiscal 2018 

consumer cyber safety segment 



revenue increased primarily due to a 161 million  increase in revenue from sales of our identity and information protection products partially offset by a 33 million  decrease in revenue from sales of our consumer security solutions operating income increased primarily due to increased revenue partially offset by higher allocated corporate costs and increased cost of revenues 

performance metrics 

we regularly monitor a number of metrics in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance our metrics may be calculated in a manner different than similar metrics used by other companies 

the following table summarizes supplemental key performance metrics for our consumer cyber safety segment 





1 represents a nongaap financial measure estimated net revenue generated from direct customers during fiscal year 2018 used in the calculation of arpu excluded a reduction in revenue related to contract liability purchase accounting adjustments required by gaap as further discussed below 

average direct customer count presents the average of the total number of direct customers at the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter and the end of the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year we define direct customers as those customers in our consumer cyber safety segment who have a direct billing relationship with us including online acquisition and retention affiliates comarketing and original contract manufacturer channels   

arpu is calculated as estimated direct customer revenues for the period divided by the average direct customer count for the same period expressed as a monthly figure we estimate direct customer net revenues to be 22 billion on a gaap basis and 21 billion on a nongaap basis in fiscal year 2019 and 2018 respectively nongaap fiscal 2018 estimated direct customer revenues used in the calculation of arpu is adjusted only to exclude a reduction in revenue of 60 million related to purchase accounting adjustments related to the february 2017 acquisition of lifelock arpu for fiscal 2018 would have been 799 without this adjustment we believe the adjustment is useful to investors to reflect arpu trends in our business by improving the comparability of arpu between periods fiscal 2019 did not include any adjustments to estimated direct customer revenue as the purchase accounting adjustments were fully amortized prior to that period nongaap estimated direct customer revenues and arpu have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for gaap estimated direct customer revenues or other gaap measures we monitor apru because it helps us understand the rate at which we are monetizing our consumer customer base 

annual retention rate is defined as the number of direct customers who have more than a oneyear tenure as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal period divided by the total number of direct customers as of the end of the period from one year ago we monitor annual retention rate to evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies to improve renewals of subscriptions 

fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017   

the following table summarizes our continuing operations for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 



 segment operating results 

enterprise security segment 



revenue increased 199 million primarily due to increases of 331 million  in revenue from sales of our network and web security solutions and 36 million from sales of endpoint and information protection solutions partially offset by a 184 million decrease in revenue as a result of the divestiture of our wss and pki solutions revenue during fiscal 2018 was also unfavorably affected by a shift in the mix of sales towards subscription and clouddelivered solutions subject to ratable revenue recognition which resulted in less inperiod recognized revenue and more revenue deferred to the balance sheet as compared 

to fiscal 2017 operating income increased 286 million primarily due to higher revenue discussed above a 51 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses and a 38 million decrease in cost of revenues 

consumer cyber safety segment 



revenue increased 616 million due to a 639 million increase in revenue from sales of our identity and information protection products acquired at the end of fiscal 2017 offset by a 23 million decrease in revenue related to our consumer security products our revenue growth reflects the benefit of the shift to subscriptionbased contracts and bundling of our consumer products which is helping to mitigate the trend of declining revenues from sales of standalone security products operating income increased 272 million primarily due to sales of our identity and information protection products partially offset by higher related cost of sales and operating expenses 

liquidity capital resources and cash requirements 

liquidity 

we have historically relied on cash generated from operations borrowings under credit facilities issuances of debt and proceeds from divestitures for our liquidity needs 

as of march 29 2019  we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 20 billion  of which 05 billion  was held by our foreign subsidiaries our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are managed with the objective to preserve principal maintain liquidity and generate investment returns the participation exemption system under current us federal tax regulations generally allows us to make distributions of nonus earnings to the us without incurring additional us federal tax however these distributions may be subject to applicable state or nonus taxes we have not recognized deferred income taxes for local country income and withholding taxes that could be incurred on distributions of certain nonus earnings or for outside basis differences in our subsidiaries because we plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings and basis differences 

we also have an undrawn credit facility of 10 billion  which expires in may 2021  

our principal cash requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs support ongoing business activities including the payment of taxes fund capital expenditures service existing debt and invest in business acquisitions as a part of our plan to deleverage our balance sheet we may from time to time make optional repayments of our debt obligations which may include repurchases of our outstanding debt depending on various factors such as market conditions 

our capital allocation strategy is to balance driving stockholder returns managing financial risk and preserving our flexibility to pursue strategic options including acquisitions historically this has included a quarterly cash dividend the repayment of debt and the repurchase of our common stock 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flow activities in fiscal 2019  compared to fiscal 2018  



our cash flow activities in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  were discussed under liquidity capital resources and cash requirement in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  included in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended march 30 2018  

cash from operating activities 

our cash flows for fiscal 2019 reflected net income of 31 million  adjusted by noncash items including amortization and depreciation of 615 million  stockbased compensation of 352 million  and loss from equity interest of 101 million  

changes in operating assets and liabilities during fiscal 2019  consisted primarily of the following 

accounts receivable  decreased 113 million  reflecting lower billings and higher collections in the last months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2018 days sales outstanding dso decreased to 54 days in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to 61 days in the corresponding period in fiscal 2018 dso is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable by revenue per day for a given quarter 

contract liabilities  increased 215 million  reflecting higher billings versus recognized revenue 

our cash flows for fiscal 2018 reflected net income of 11 billion  adjusted by noncash amortization and depreciation of 640 million  stockbased compensation of 610 million  offset by a deferred tax benefit of 18 billion  primarily as a result of the enactment of the 2017 tax act in december 2017 and a gain on divestiture of 653 million  

changes in operating assets and liabilities during fiscal 2018  consisted primarily of the following 

accounts receivable  increased 170 million  reflecting higher billings in the last months of fiscal 2018 and our shift in sales to solutions with ratable revenue recognition in our enterprise security segment 

contract liabilities  increased 541 million  reflecting our shift in sales contracts to a higher mix of solutions subject to ratable versus point in time revenue recognition and longer contract duration in our enterprise security segment which resulted in less inperiod revenue recognized and higher billings towards the end of the fiscal year reflecting seasonal sales cycles in that segment these factors were partially offset by a decrease of 319 million in divestiture of our wss and pki solutions 

income taxes payable  increased 880 million  reflecting the onetime transition tax of 896 million under the 2017 tax act 

cash from investing activities

cash requirements 

debt  as of march 29 2019  our total outstanding principal amount of indebtedness was 45 billion  summarized as follows see note 8  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our debt 



debt covenant compliance    the senior term loan a5 agreement contains customary representations and warranties nonfinancial covenants for financial reporting affirmative and negative covenants including a covenant that we maintain a ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization of not more than 600  to 10 through december 31 2018 then 525  to 10 thereafter and restrictions on subsidiary indebtedness liens stock repurchases and dividends with exceptions permitting our regular quarterly dividend as of march 29 2019  we were in compliance with all debt covenants

stock repurchases  under our stock repurchase program we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through open market and through accelerated stock repurchase transactions open market transactions including through trading plans intended to qualify under rule 10b51 under the exchange act and privatelynegotiated transactions as of march 29 2019  the remaining balance of our stock repurchase authorization is 1048 million  and does not have an expiration date the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities 

contractual obligations 

the following is a schedule of our significant contractual obligations as of march 29 2019  





 due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits and other longterm taxes as of march 29 2019  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities therefore 373 million  in longterm income taxes payable has been excluded from the contractual obligations table see note 11  to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

indemnifications 

in the ordinary course of business we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers vendors lessors business partners subsidiaries and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of agreements or representations and warranties made by us  refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our indemnifications 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies we do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

our shortterm investments primarily consist of corporate bonds an increase in interest could have an adverse impact on its market value as of march 29 2019  the fair value of our shortterm investments was 252 million  a hypothetical increase in the corporate bonds’ yield curve of 50 basis points would not result in a significant reduction in fair value 

as of march 29 2019  we had 40 billion  in aggregate principal amount of fixedrate senior notes and convertible senior notes outstanding with a carrying amount and a fair value of 40 billion  based on level 2 inputs since these notes bear interest at fixed rates they do not result in any financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change 

as of march 29 2019  we also had 500 million outstanding debt with variable interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate libor a reasonably possible hypothetical adverse change of 50 basis points in libor would not result in a significant increase in interest expense on an annualized basis 

in addition we have a 10 billion revolving credit facility that if drawn bears interest at a variable rate based on libor and would be subject to the same risks associated with adverse changes in libor 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we conduct business in numerous currencies through our worldwide operations and our entities hold monetary assets or liabilities earn revenues or incur costs in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency   primarily in euro japanese yen and british pound in addition we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services we provide our cash flow results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities as a result we are exposed to foreign exchange gains or losses which impacts our operating results 

we have a foreign exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures manage these exposures and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations through which we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries with up to twelve months in duration we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of the changes in foreign exchange rates the gains and losses on these foreign exchange contracts are recorded in interest and other net in our statement of operations 

as of march 29 2019  we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of 11 billion  to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposure with an insignificant fair value a hypothetical ten percent depreciation of foreign currency would result in a reduction in fair value of our forward contracts of 84 million for fiscal 2019 this analysis disregards the possibilities that the rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area 

in addition to help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates during fiscal 2019 we initiated a program under which we may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as of march 29 2019  the notional amount of the related outstanding forward contracts was 116 million  and their fair value was not significant these contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on investments in foreign operations the foreign currency gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in other comprehensive income

research and development expenses were 823 million 748 million and 812 million in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively representing approximately 20 21 and 21 of revenue in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the percentage fluctuates between periods as a result of a variety of factors including changes in sales level and foreign currency exchange rates we believe that technical leadership is essential to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development

acquisitions 

our strategy will be complemented by business combinations that fit strategically and meet specific profitability hurdles our acquisitions are designed to enhance the features and functionality of our existing products and extend our product leadership in core markets we consider timetomarket synergies with existing products and potential market share gains when evaluating the economics of acquisitions of technologies product lines or companies we may acquire or dispose of other technologies products and companies in the future see note 6  to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our acquisitions in fiscal 2017 

competition 

our markets are consolidating highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology the competitive landscape has changed significantly over the past few years with new competition arising much of the market growth has come from startups whose focus is on solving a specific customer issue or delivering a nicheoriented product and from larger integration providers that increasingly are looking to put various types of protection into their platforms we are focused on delivering 

comprehensive customer solutions integrating across our broad product portfolio and partnering with other technology providers to differentiate ourselves from the competition we believe that the principal competitive factors necessary to be successful in our industry include product quality and effectiveness timetomarket price reputation financial stability breadth of product offerings customer support brand recognition and effective sales and marketing efforts 

in addition to the competition we face from direct competitors we face indirect or potential competition from retailers application providers operating system providers network equipment manufacturers and other oems who may provide various solutions and functions in their current and future products we also compete for access to retail distribution channels and for spending at the retail level and in corporate accounts in addition we compete with other software companies operating system providers network equipment manufacturers and other oems to acquire technologies products or companies and to publish software developed by third parties we also compete with other software companies in our effort to place our products on the computer equipment sold to consumers and enterprises by oems 

most of the channels in which our products are offered are highly competitive some of our consumer competitors are intensely focused on customer acquisition which has led competitors to offer their technology for free engage in aggressive marketing or enter into competitive partnerships we view our competitive landscape as follows 

 intellectual property 

protective measures 

we regard some of the features of our internal operations software and documentation as proprietary and rely on copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures contractual arrangements and other measures to protect our proprietary information our intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that enables us to gain recognition for our products services and technology and enhance our competitive position 

as part of our confidentiality procedures we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with our employees distributors and corporate partners and we enter into license agreements with respect to our software documentation and other proprietary information these license agreements are generally nontransferable and have either a perpetual or subscription based time limited term we also educate our employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to protect our facilities equipment and networks 

trademarks patents copyrights and licenses 

symantec and the symantec logo are trademarks or registered trademarks in the us and other countries in addition to symantec and the symantec logo we have used registered or applied to register other specific trademarks and service marks to help distinguish our products technologies and services from those of our competitors in the us and foreign countries and jurisdictions we enforce our trademark service mark and trade name rights in the us and abroad the duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country and in the us we generally are able to maintain our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in use 

we have approximately 2100 patents in addition to foreign patents and pending us and foreign patent applications which relate to various aspects of our products and technology the duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and for the us is typically 17 years from the date of issuance of the patent or 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application resulting in the patent which we believe is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products 

our products are protected under us and international copyright laws and laws related to the protection of intellectual property and proprietary information we take measures to label such products with the appropriate proprietary rights notices and we actively enforce such rights in the us and abroad however these measures may not provide sufficient protection and our intellectual property rights may be challenged in addition we license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our products and generally must rely on the third party to protect the licensed intellectual property rights while we believe that our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent trademark license or other intellectual property right 

seasonality 

as is typical for many large technology companies our business is seasonal orders are generally higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and lower in our first and second fiscal quarters revenue generally reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than orders because revenue is not recognized until an order is shipped or services are performed and other revenue recognition criteria are met and because a significant portion of our inperiod revenue comes from our deferred revenue balance 

employees 

as of march 31 2017 we employed more than 13000 people worldwide

for the last few years we have experienced a number of transitions as we have attempted to revitalize our business model improve execution and innovate new products and services these transitions have involved changes to management and other key personnel shifts in our strategic direction and more recently changes to our corporate structure as a result of the divestiture of veritas and the acquisition of blue coat in particular in connection with our acquisition of blue coat we experienced changes to our executive team during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2017 appointing three former blue coat executive officers to the positions of chief executive officer president and chief operating officer and executive vice president and chief financial officer transitions of these kind can be disruptive can result in the loss of institutional focus and employee morale and make the execution of business strategies more difficult we are also focused on addressing dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the continued decline in the pc market the market shifts towards mobility the continued transition towards cloudbased solutions and architectural shifts in the provision of security all of which has made it more difficult for us to compete effectively and requires us to improve our product and service offerings we may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our efforts to address these challenges and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs in addition we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with these efforts and the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate if we do not succeed in these efforts or if these efforts are more costly or timeconsuming than expected our business and results of operations may be adversely affected which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business 

fluctuations in demand for our products and services are driven by many factors and a decrease in demand for our products could adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and services due to a variety of factors including market transitions general economic conditions competition product obsolescence technological change shifts in buying patterns financial difficulties and budget constraints of our current and potential customers awareness of security threats to it systems and other factors while such factors may in some periods increase product sales fluctuations in demand can also negatively impact our product sales if demand for our products and solutions declines whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in buying patterns our revenues and margins would likely be adversely affected 

additionally since blue coat’s business historically experienced a major product refresh cycle approximately once every five 

years as hardware appliances reach the end of their useful life we anticipate that we will experience fluctuations in demand as we enter and exit cycles in which many of our customers refresh their install base of hardware appliance products with our latest equipment replacing older versions of the hardware that have reached the end of their useful life and are no longer supported under maintenance contracts our appliances generally have a five year endoflife date from the date of purchase which we expect will extend refresh cycles for our hardware appliances over a multiyear period and reduce the impact of a product refresh cycle in any one period however we cannot assure you that we will not experience uneven demand for these products in any one period causing our business and results of operations to be adversely affected 

a refresh cycle also creates an opportunity for our competitors to try to displace our existing product deployments for our customers who may be more inclined to consider other product solutions at a time when they otherwise need to replace our existing products that have reached the end of their useful life the extent to which customers decide to refresh by purchasing products from our current or future competitors as opposed to purchasing our new products may significantly impact our current period product revenues as well as future service revenue 

our business depends on customers renewing their arrangements for maintenance subscriptions managed security services and saas offerings 

a large portion of our revenue is derived from arrangements for maintenance subscriptions managed security services and saas offerings yet existing customers have no contractual obligation to purchase additional solutions after the initial subscription or contract period our customers’ renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including their level of satisfaction with our solutions or our customer support customer budgets and the pricing of our solutions compared with the solutions offered by our competitors any of which may cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected if at all accordingly we must invest significant time and resources in providing ongoing value to our customers if these efforts fail or if our customers do not renew for other reasons or if they renew on terms less favorable to us our revenue may decline and our business will suffer 

if we are unable to develop new and enhanced products and services that achieve widespread market acceptance or if we are unable to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our existing products and services or adapt our business model to keep pace with industry trends our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our future success depends on our ability to respond to the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing or introducing new products product upgrades and services on a timely basis we have in the past incurred and will continue to incur significant research and development expenses as we strive to remain competitive additionally we must continually address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the emergence of advanced persistent threats in the security space the continued decline in the pc market and the market shift towards mobility and the increasing transition towards cloudbased solutions all of which have made it more difficult for us to compete effectively for example we have been increasingly investing in solutions that address the cloud security market particularly our acquisition of blue coat but we cannot be certain that the cloud security market will develop at a rate or in the manner we expect or that we will be able to compete successfully with more established competitors in the cloud security market customers may require features and capabilities that our current solutions do not have our failure to develop solutions that satisfy customer preferences in a timely and costeffective manner may harm our ability to renew our subscriptions with existing customers and to create or increase demand for our solutions and may adversely impact our operating results new product development and introduction involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including 

 if we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges or if our new products product upgrades and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

we operate in a highly competitive environment and our competitors may gain market share in the markets for our products that could adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to decline 

we operate in intensely competitive markets that experience rapid technological developments changes in industry 

standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements if we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a decline in our sales that could adversely affect our business and operating results to compete successfully we must maintain an innovative research and development effort to develop new products and services and enhance existing products and services effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors appropriately respond to competitive strategies and effectively adapt to technological changes and changes in the ways that our information is accessed used and stored within our enterprise and consumer markets if we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors or to changing technological and customer demands our competitive position and our financial results could be adversely affected 

our competitors include software vendors that offer software products that directly compete with our product offerings in addition to competing with these vendors directly for sales to endusers of our products we compete with them for the opportunity to have our products bundled with the product offerings of our strategic partners such as computer hardware oems and isps our competitors could gain market share from us if any of these strategic partners replace our products with the products of our competitors or if these partners more actively promote our competitors’ products than our products in addition software vendors who have bundled our products with theirs may choose to bundle their software with their own or other vendors’ software or may limit our access to standard product interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop products for their platform in the future further product development by these vendors could cause our software applications and services to become redundant which could significantly impact our sales and financial results 

we face growing competition from network equipment computer hardware manufacturers large operating system providers and other technology companies as well as from companies in the identity threat protection space such as credit bureaus many of these competitors are increasingly developing and incorporating into their products data protection software that competes at some levels with our product offerings our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our products 

security protection is also offered by some of our competitors at prices lower than our prices or in some cases is offered free of charge some companies offer the lowerpriced or free security products within their computer hardware or software products that we believe are inferior to our products and saas offerings our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive these security products as replacing the need for more effective full featured products and services such as those that we provide the expansion of these competitive trends could have a significant negative impact on our sales and financial results by causing among other things price reductions of our products reduced profitability and loss of market share 

many of our competitors have greater financial technical sales marketing or other resources than we do and consequently may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their products instead of ours further   consolidation within our industry or other changes in the competitive environment could result in larger competitors that compete with us on several levels we also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the markets in which we compete 

reduced trust in our ssltls certificates could adversely affect our website security business 

our website security business depends on the widespread acceptance of the digital certificates we provide to enable communications security infrastructure we have in the past issued and may in the future issue ssltls certificates out of compliance with the requirements of the certificate authority and browser forum baseline requirements failures of this kind could cause popular browsers to reduce or eliminate trust in our ssltsl certificates or the related roots or otherwise disrupt our position as a leading certificate authority for example google recently issued a proposal to reduce trust in our ssltsl certificates based on our past issuance of noncompliant certificates if any popular browser reduced trust in our ssltsl certificates or roots it would damage our brand and cause our ssltsl certificates to fail to interoperate resulting in customer attrition for our website security business which could adversely affect our results of operations and our stock price 

fluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected the trading price of our outstanding securities in the past and could affect the trading price of outstanding securities in the future 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts and investors the trading price of our outstanding securities could be negatively affected any volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance 

factors associated with our industry the operation of our business and the markets for our products may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate including 



 any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of our outstanding securities to fluctuate significantly 

our business models present execution and competitive risks 

in recent years our saas offerings have become increasingly critical in our business our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying saas offerings for consumers and business customers pricing and delivery models are evolving devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud we are making significant investments in and devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own saas strategies including our acquisition of blue coat in august 2016 we cannot assure you that our investments in and development of saas offerings will achieve the expected returns for us or that we will be able to compete successfully in the marketplace in addition to software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support saas offerings these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we are successful in this business model depends on our execution in a number of areas including 

 we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully 

the intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully any such changes may reduce margins and could adversely affect operating results additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud and saas delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact pricing in both our onpremise enterprise software business and our cloud business as well as overall demand for our onpremise software product and service offerings which could reduce our revenues and profitability our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings which could put pressure on us to further discount our product or support pricing 

any broadbased change to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies we or our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm gotomarket or pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products if we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer 

demand our revenues could decrease the increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing models 

defects disruptions or risks related to the provision of our saas offerings could impair our ability to deliver our services and could expose us to liability damage our brand and reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business 

our saas offerings may contain errors or defects that users identify after they begin using them that could result in unanticipated service interruptions which could harm our reputation and our business since our customers use our saas offerings for missioncritical protection from threats to electronic information endpoint devices and computer networks any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems with our saas offerings could significantly harm our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses if that occurs customers could elect not to renew or delay or withhold payment to us we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation 

we currently serve our saasbased customers from hosting facilities located across the globe damage to or failure of any significant element of these hosting facilities could result in interruptions in our service which could harm our customers and expose us to liability interruptions or failures in our service delivery could cause customers to terminate their subscriptions with us could adversely affect our renewal rates and could harm our ability to attract new customers our business would also be harmed if our customers believe that our saas offerings are unreliable 

we collect use disclose store or otherwise process personal information which subjects us to privacy and data security laws and contractual commitments and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and commitments could harm our business 

we collect use store or disclose collectively “process” an increasingly large amount of personal information including from employees and customers in connection with the operation of our business the volume variety and velocity of the personal information we process increased significantly as a result of our acquisition of lifelock in february 2017 as its identity and fraud protection offerings rely on large data repositories of personal information and consumer transactions the personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal state local and foreign laws regarding privacy and data security as well as contractual commitments any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions fines litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business our customers may also accidentally disclose their passwords or store them on a device that is lost or stolen creating the perception that our systems are not secure against thirdparty access 

additionally if third parties that we work with such as vendors or developers violate applicable laws or our policies such violations may also place personal information at risk and have an adverse effect on our business changes to applicable privacy or data security laws could impact how we process personal information and therefore limit the effectiveness of our products services or features or our ability to develop new products services or features 

our acquisitions and divestitures create special risks and challenges that could adversely affect our future financial results 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire or divest businesses or assets these activities can involve a number of special risks and challenges including 

 if integration of our acquired businesses is not successful we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects to integrate acquired businesses we must integrate and manage the personnel and technology systems of the acquired operations we also must effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired business organizations into our own in a way that aligns various interests and may need to enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions moreover to be successful some acquisitions particularly acquisitions of large complex companies such as blue coat and lifelock depend on largescale product technology and sales force integrations that are difficult to complete on a timely basis or at all and may be more susceptible to the special risks and 

challenges described above 

any of the foregoing and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability or other financial benefits from our divested or acquired businesses or assets or to realize other anticipated benefits of divestitures or acquisitions such as anticipated operating efficiencies or other cost savings 

if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to their customers our operating results could be adversely affected 

we sell our products to customers around the world through multitiered sales and distribution networks 

sales through these different channels involve distinct risks including the following 

direct sales  a significant portion of our revenues from enterprise products is derived from sales by our direct sales force to endusers special risks associated with direct sales include 

 indirect sales channels  a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels including distributors that sell our products to endusers and other resellers this channel involves a number of risks including 

 oem sales channels  a portion of our revenues is derived from sales through our oem partners that incorporate our products into or bundle our products with their products our reliance on this sales channel involves many risks including 

 if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels successfully these channels may conflict with one another or otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate which could reduce our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our competitive position some of our distribution partners have experienced financial difficulties in the past and if our partners suffer financial difficulties in the future because of general economic conditions or for other reasons these partners may delay paying their obligations to us and we may have reduced sales or increased bad debt expense that could adversely affect our operating results in addition reliance on multiple channels subjects us to events that could cause unpredictability in demand which could increase the risk that we may be unable to plan effectively for the future and could result in adverse operating results in future periods 

over the long term we intend to invest in research and development activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results 

while we continue to focus on managing our costs and expenses over the long term we also intend to invest significantly in 

research and development activities as we focus on organic growth through internal innovation in each of our business segments we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position and that the level of these investments will increase in future periods as the blue coat acquisition has expanded our focus areas we recognize the costs associated with these research and development investments earlier than the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairments 

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically reallocate our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel reschedule or adjust with contract manufacturers and suppliers 

further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to evaluate goodwill impairment on an annual basis and between annual evaluations in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment evaluations may result in a charge to earnings 

our inability to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity event could impair our ability to deliver our products and services and harm our business 

we are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure to provide our products and services to our customers for example we host many of our products using thirdparty data center facilities and we do not control the operation of these facilities these facilities are vulnerable to damage interruption or performance problems from earthquakes hurricanes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they are also subject to breakins computer viruses sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in the delivery of our products and services 

furthermore our business administration human resources and finance services depend on the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations a disruption or failure of these systems or operations because of a disaster or other business continuity event could cause data to be lost or otherwise delay our ability to complete sales and provide the highest level of service to our customers in addition we could have difficulty producing accurate financial statements on a timely basis which could adversely affect the trading value of our stock although we endeavor to ensure there is redundancy in these systems and that they are regularly backedup there are no assurances that data recovery in the event of a disaster would be effective or occur in an efficient manner including the operation of our global civilian cyber intelligence threat network 

any errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our products and services could harm our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses for example we may experience disruptions outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors including infrastructure changes human or software errors capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our website simultaneously fraud or security attacks in some instances we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time interruptions in our products and services including the operation of our global civilian cyber intelligence threat network could impact our revenues or cause customers to cease doing business with us in addition our business would be harmed if any of events of this nature caused our customers and potential customers to believe our services are unreliable our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we could potentially lose customer data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario 

we may experience difficulties in realizing the expected benefits of the acquisition of blue coat and lifelock and may continue to incur significant acquisitionrelated costs and transition costs in connection with these acquisitions 

we completed the acquisition of blue coat in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and lifelock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we have invested and continue to invest substantial monetary and other resources in the integration of these companies the success of each acquisition depends in part on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities including certain cost savings and operational efficiencies or synergies and growth prospects from combining the respective companies with symantec in an efficient and effective manner we may never realize these business opportunities and growth prospects we may incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees management cannot ensure that the elimination of duplicative costs or the realization of other efficiencies will offset the transaction and integration costs in the near term or at all 

additionally we may encounter difficulties surrounding the integration of these companies which could delay or prevent our achievement of the expected benefits from the respective acquisition moreover risks specific to the acquired businesses could 

also delay or prevent our achievement of the expected benefits from the respective acquisition for example since lifelock’s identity and fraud protection products depend extensively upon continued access to and receipt of credible timely and complete data from external sources including data received from customers vendors who are also competitors and fulfillment partners the value we derive from the lifelock acquisition our competitive position and our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed as a result of our loss of access to data sources or reliance on sources that prove to be ineffective or inaccurate 

as a result of our acquisition of lifelock our consumer digital safety segment became subject to increased regulation which could impede our ability to market and provide our services or adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

as a result of our acquisition of lifelock a portion of our consumer digital safety segment became subject to increased regulation including a wide variety of federal state and local laws and regulations including the fair credit reporting act the grammleachbliley act the federal trade commission act “ftc act” and comparable state laws that are patterned after the ftc act moreover lifelock entered into consent decrees and similar arrangements with the federal trade commission the “ftc” and 35 states’ attorneys general in 2010 and a settlement with the ftc in 2015 relating to allegations that certain of lifelock’s advertising and marketing practices constituted deceptive acts or practices in violation of the ftc act which impose additional restrictions on the lifelock business within our consumer digital safety segment including prohibitions against making any misrepresentation of “the means methods procedures effects effectiveness coverage or scope of” lifelock’s identity theft protection services any of the laws and regulations that apply to our business are subject to revision or new or changed interpretations and we cannot predict the impact of such changes on our business 

additionally as a result of our lifelock acquisition aspects of our consumer digital safety segment are subject to the broad regulatory supervisory and enforcement powers of the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb and may exercise authority with respect to our services or the marketing and servicing of those services by overseeing our financial institution or credit reporting agency customers and suppliers or by otherwise exercising its supervisory regulatory or enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services 

any cost reduction initiatives that we undertake may not deliver the results we expect and these actions may adversely affect our business 

in may 2016 we announced a fiscal 2017 restructuring plan to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2018 this initiative could result in disruptions to our operations any costcutting measures could also negatively impact our business by delaying the introduction of new products or technologies interrupting service of additional products or impacting employee retention in addition we cannot be sure that the cost reduction and streamlining initiatives will be as successful in reducing our overall expenses as we expect or that additional costs will not offset any such reductions or streamlining if our operating costs are higher than we expect or if we do not maintain adequate control of our costs and expenses our results of operations will suffer 

our international operations involve risks that could increase our expenses adversely affect our operating results and require increased time and attention of our management 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the us and we have significant operations outside of the us including engineering sales customer support and production we have expanded through our acquisition of blue coat and expect further expansion of our international operations but such expansion is contingent upon our identification of growth opportunities our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations including 



 a significant portion of our transactions outside of the us is denominated in foreign currencies accordingly our revenues and expenses will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates for example in recent periods the us dollar has strengthened significantly against the euro and other major currencies which has adversely impacted our reported international revenue we expect to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future especially if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales or our operations outside the us continue to increase 

the level of corporate income tax from sales to our nonus customers is generally less than the level of tax from sales to our us customers this benefit is contingent upon existing tax regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits 

our products are complex and operate in a wide variety of environments systems applications and configurations which could result in errors or product failures 

because we offer very complex products undetected errors failures or bugs may occur especially when products are first introduced or when new versions are released our products are often installed and used in largescale computing environments with different operating systems system management software and equipment and networking configurations which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors failures or bugs in our products our customers’ computing environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and nonstandard configurations that make prerelease testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and timeconsuming in addition despite testing by us and others errors failures or bugs may not be found in new products or releases until after commencement of commercial shipments in the past we have discovered software errors failures and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and in some cases have experienced delayed or lost revenues as a result of these errors 

errors failures or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity damage to our brand product returns loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products loss of competitive position or claims by customers or others many of our enduser customers use our products in applications that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other less critical software products in addition if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity security or availability occurs in one of our enduser customer’s systems regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions delays or cessation of our product licensing which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating results 

if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements and manage our supply chain we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays that could harm our business 

we generally provide forecasts of our requirements to our supply chain partners on a rolling basis if our forecast exceeds our actual requirements a supply chain partner may assess additional charges or we may have liability for excess inventory each of which could negatively affect our gross margin if our forecast is less than our actual requirements the applicable supply chain partner may have insufficient time or components to produce or fulfill our product requirements which could delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products or fulfillment of orders for our products and result in delays in shipments customer dissatisfaction and deferral or loss of revenue further we may be required to purchase sufficient inventory to satisfy our future needs in situations where a component or product is being discontinued if we fail to accurately predict our requirements we may be unable to fulfill those orders or we may be required to record charges for excess inventory any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are dependent on original design manufacturers contract manufacturers and thirdparty logistics providers to design and manufacture our hardwarebased products and to fulfill orders for our hardwarebased products 

we depend primarily on original design manufacturers each of which is a thirdparty original design manufacturer for numerous companies to codesign and codevelop the hardware platforms for our products we also depend on independent contract manufacturers each of which is a thirdparty contract manufacturer for numerous companies to manufacture and fulfill our hardwarebased products these supply chain partners are not committed to design or manufacture our products or to fulfill orders for our products on a longterm basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price in addition certain of our products or key components of our products are currently manufactured by a single thirdparty supplier there are alternative suppliers that could provide components as our agreements do not provide for exclusivity or minimum purchase quantities but the transition and qualification from one supplier to another could be lengthy costly and difficult also from time to time we may be required to add new supply chain partner relationships or new manufacturing or fulfillment sites to accommodate growth in orders or the addition of new products it is time consuming and costly to qualify and implement new supply chain partner relationships and new manufacturing or fulfillment sites and such additions increase the complexity of our supply chain management our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to effectively manage our supply chain partner relationships if one or more of our original design manufacturers does not meet our development schedules if one or more of our independent contract manufacturers 

experiences delays disruptions or quality control problems in manufacturing our products if one or more of our thirdparty logistics providers experiences delays or disruptions or otherwise fails to meet our fulfillment schedules or if we are required to add or replace original design manufacturers independent contract manufacturers thirdparty logistics providers or fulfillment sites 

in addition these supply chain partners have access to certain of our critical confidential information and could wrongly disclose or misuse such information or be subject to a breach or other compromise that introduces a vulnerability or other defect in the products manufactured by our supply chain partners while we take precautions to ensure that hardware manufactured by our independent contractors is reviewed any espionage acts malware attacks theft of confidential information or other malicious cyber incidents perpetrated either directly or indirectly through our independent contractors may compromise our system infrastructure expose us to litigation and associated expenses and lead to reputational harm that could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results in addition we are subject to risks resulting from the perception that certain jurisdictions including china do not comply with internationally recognized rights of freedom of expression and privacy and may permit labor practices that are deemed unacceptable under evolving standards of social responsibility if manufacturing or logistics in these foreign countries is disrupted for any reason including natural disasters it system failures military or government actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues or if the purchase or sale of products from such foreign countries is prohibited or disfavored our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 includes disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo “drc” and adjoining countries and procedures pertaining to a manufacturer’s efforts regarding the source of such minerals sec rules implementing these requirements and other international standards such as the organisation for economic cooperation and development due diligence guidance for responsible supply chains of minerals from conflictaffected and high risk areas may have the effect of reducing the pool of suppliers who can supply drc “conflict free” components and parts and we may not be able to obtain drc conflict free products or supplies in sufficient quantities for our products we may also face reputational challenges with our customers stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the minerals used in our products 

if we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology our financial results could be harmed 

most of our software and underlying technology is proprietary we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws however all of these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties third parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise obtain use distribute and sell our proprietary information without authorization 

third parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently by designing around our patents our shrink wrap license agreements are not signed by licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions furthermore the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the us and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries the unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could adversely affect our ability to access software operating system and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor or cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products to their customers in addition any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in could be costly may distract management from daytoday operations and may lead to additional claims against us which could adversely affect our operating results 

from time to time we are a party to lawsuits and investigations which typically require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses and which could if not determined favorably negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have initiated and been named as a party to lawsuits including patent litigation class actions and governmental claims and we may be named in additional litigation the expense of initiating and defending such litigation may be costly and divert management’s attention from the daytoday operations of our business which could adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows in addition an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could result in significant fines settlements monetary damages or injunctive relief that could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business results of operations and cash flows 

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

from time to time third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights including claims regarding patents copyrights and trademarks because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that the number of these claims may grow in addition former employers of our former current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers any such claim with or without merit could result in costly litigation and distract management from daytoday operations if we are not successful in defending such claims we could be required to stop selling delay shipments of or redesign our products pay monetary amounts as damages enter into royalty or licensing arrangements or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have 

with some of our customers we cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to investigate defend and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

in addition we license and use software from third parties in our business these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and may expose us to additional liability this liability or our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

adverse global economic events may impact our customers’ ability to do business with us thereby harming our business operating results and financial condition 

adverse macroeconomic conditions could negatively affect our customers thereby impacting our business operating results or financial condition during challenging economic times and periods of high unemployment current or potential customers may delay or forgo decisions to license new products or additional instances of existing products upgrade their existing hardware or operating environments which upgrades are often a catalyst for new purchases of our software or purchase services customers may also have difficulties in obtaining the requisite thirdparty financing to complete the purchase of our products and services any of these scenarios could adversely affect our business 

our exposure to credit risk and payment delinquencies on our accounts receivable significantly increases in adverse economic conditions 

an adverse macroeconomic environment could subject us to increased credit risk should customers be unable to pay us or delay paying us for previously purchased products and services our outstanding accounts receivables are generally not secured in addition our standard terms and conditions permit payment within a specified number of days following the receipt of our product accordingly reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase in addition weakness in the market for end users of our products could harm the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could then delay paying their obligations to us this would further increase our credit risk exposure and potentially cause delays in our recognition of revenue on sales to these customers further while no customer accounted for more than 10 of our total net revenues in any of fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 two distributors and one distributor accounted for 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2017 and april 1 2016 respectively the loss of this or other large customers could have a negative impact on our business while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on our receivables and have not suffered any material losses to date there can be no assurance such procedures will continue to effectively limit our credit risk and avoid future losses 

our effective tax rate may increase which could increase our income tax expense and reduce increase our net income loss 

our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

 we report our results of operations based on our determination of the aggregate amount of taxes owed in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate from time to time we receive notices that a tax authority in a particular jurisdiction believes that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority we are regularly engaged in discussions and sometimes disputes with these tax authorities we are engaged in disputes of this nature at this time if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we cannot predict our future capital needs and we may be unable to obtain financing which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the onset or continuation of adverse economic conditions may make it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations investing activities including potential acquisitions or divestitures or financing activities any required financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all if we raise additional funds by obtaining loans from third parties the terms of those financing arrangements may include negative covenants or other restrictions on our business that could impair our financial or operational flexibility and would also require us to fund additional interest expense if additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to successfully develop or enhance our software and 

services through acquisitions in order to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures which could have a material adverse effect on our software and services offerings revenues results of operations and financial condition 

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity capital position ability to hedge certain financial risks borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

our credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies and such agencies have in the past and could in the future downgrade our ratings we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade may further impact us in a similar manner and may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position ability to hedge certain financial risks and access to capital markets in addition changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could increase the interest we pay on outstanding or future debt 

our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 

as of march 31 2017 we had an aggregate of 83 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between calendar years 2017 and 2025 including approximately 46 billion in aggregate principal amount of existing senior notes and 37 billion of outstanding term loans under our senior credit facilities and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future in addition as of march 31 2017 we had 10 billion available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility our ability to pay interest and repay principal for our substantial level of indebtedness is dependent on our ability to manage our business operations generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully 

our substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 

 we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future subject to the restrictions contained in the existing credit agreements and the terms of our other indebtedness our ability to access additional funding under our revolving credit facility will depend upon among other things the absence of a default under such facility including any default arising from a failure to comply with the related covenants if we are unable to comply with such covenants our liquidity may be adversely affected as of march 31 2017 approximately 37 billion of our debt bore interest at variable rates and the adverse effect of a 50basis point increase in interest rates would have increased such total annual cash interest by approximately 19 million 

our ability to meet expenses to remain in compliance with our covenants under our debt instruments and to make future principal and interest payments in respect of our debt depends on among other things our operating performance competitive developments and financial market conditions all of which are significantly affected by financial business economic and other factors we are not able to control many of these factors accordingly our cash flow may not be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt including the notes and meet our other obligations 

our existing credit agreements impose operating and financial restrictions on us 

the existing credit agreements contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to 



 all of these covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance our operations meet or otherwise address our capital needs pursue business opportunities react to market conditions or otherwise restrict activities or business plans a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness if a default occurs the relevant lenders could elect to declare the indebtedness together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable and to the extent such indebtedness is secured in the future proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness 

we may not have sufficient cash flows from operating activities to service or repay our indebtedness and meet our other cash needs and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future our ability to generate cash will be subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors some of which are beyond our control in particular we have 6810 million in aggregate principal amount of debt that is maturing within the next five fiscal years 1310 million of which is now being classified as current if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase in addition changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could increase the interest we pay on outstanding or future debt our future cash flow cash on hand or available borrowings may not be sufficient to meet our obligations and commitments if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service or repay our indebtedness and to meet our other commitments we will be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness selling material assets or operations or seeking to raise additional debt or equity capital these actions may not be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all or these actions may not enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements in addition the existing credit agreements contain and any of our other debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all our debts 

in addition we conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries none of which are generally guarantors of our debt accordingly repayment of our indebtedness will be dependent in part on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise in general our subsidiaries will not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our debt or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make the required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and as a result certain of our creditors could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable the lenders under our revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

our software products saas offerings and website may be subject to intentional disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future sales 

despite our precautions and significant ongoing investments to protect against security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and other intentional disruptions of our products and offerings we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance and availability of our products and offerings and harm our reputation as a company similarly experienced computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our website and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services including the operation of our global civilian cyber intelligence threat network 

because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an event could adversely affect our competitive position reputation brand and future sales of our products and offerings and our customers may assert claims against us related to resulting losses of confidential or proprietary information furthermore our employees or contractors may either intentionally or unintentionally subject us to information security risks and incidents our business could be subject to significant disruption and we could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm in the event of such incidents 

some of our products contain “open source” software and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business 

certain of our products are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under socalled “open source” licenses which may include by way of example the gnu general public license gnu lesser general public license the mozilla public license the bsd license and the apache license 

some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use by the terms of certain open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary 

software with open source software in a certain manner in addition to risks related to license requirements usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third party commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software we have established processes to help alleviate these risks including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products in addition many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated and could if not properly addressed negatively affect our business 

if we are unable to adequately address increased customer demands through our technical support services our relationships with our customers and our financial results may be adversely affected 

we offer technical support services with many of our products we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers further customer demand for these services without corresponding revenues could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results 

we have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide consumer support functions to third party service providers if these companies experience financial difficulties do not maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level under these contracts the level of support services to our customers may be significantly disrupted which could materially harm our relationships with these customers 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees lose key personnel fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully or fail to manage our employee base effectively we may be unable to develop new and enhanced products and services effectively manage or expand our business or increase our revenues 

our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key management technical sales marketing finance and other personnel our officers and other key personnel are employeesatwill and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them competition for people with the specific skills that we require is significant and we face difficulties in attracting retaining and motivating employees as a result in connection with the acquisition of blue coat we experienced management turnover and this may lead to employee attrition and related difficulties and these difficulties may continue or increase following our acquisition of lifelock in order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace we believe that we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees in addition we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation plans and accounting rules require us to treat the issuance of equitybased compensation as compensation expense as a result we may decide to issue fewer equitybased incentives and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees or conversely if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution from time to time key personnel leave our company and the incidence of this increased in recent periods due to the transitions we have experienced over the last few years including the divestiture of veritas for example in connection with the blue coat acquisition we appointed their chief executive officer president and chief operating officer and chief financial officer to those positions in our company in fiscal 2017 while we strive to reduce the negative impact of changes in our leadership the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and our results of operations in addition hiring training and successfully integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time consuming and expensive may cause additional disruptions to our operations and may be unsuccessful which could negatively impact future financial results these risks may be exacerbated by the uncertainty associated with the transitions we have experienced over the last few years 

our contracts with the us government include compliance audit and review obligations any failure to meet these obligations could result in civil damages andor penalties being assessed against us by the government 

we sell products and services through government contracting programs directly and via partners though we no longer hold a gsa contract in the ordinary course of business sales under these government contracting programs may be subject to audit or investigation by the us government noncompliance identified as a result of such reviews as well as noncompliance identified on our own could subject us to damages and other penalties which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included under item 15 of this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

fiscal calendar and basis of presentation 

we have a 5253week fiscal year ending on the friday closest to march 31 unless otherwise stated references to years in this report relate to fiscal year and periods ended march 31 2017 april 1 2016 and april 3 2015 our fiscal 2017 and 2016 were 52week years whereas our fiscal 2015 was a 53week year 

the results of veritas are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and thus have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all reported periods accordingly the following discussion reflects our current segment reporting structure which was reduced from three to two segments and segment results for all reported periods have been adjusted to conform to the current segment structure in addition the following discussion relates to our continuing operations unless stated otherwise 

financial highlights and business trends 

the following charts  provide an overview of key financial metrics for each of the last three fiscal years in millions except for percentage of revenues 

   

in fiscal 2017 we made two key acquisitions to expand our offerings in both our operating segments 



 here are our key financial results for continuing operations in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 

 we expect our operating margin to fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including our operating results and the timing and amount of expenses incurred 

results of operations 

segment operating results 

enterprise security segment by fiscal year 

our enterprise security segment protects organizations so they can securely conduct business while leveraging new platforms and data the following tables are in millions except for percentage of revenues 

                     

2017  compared to 2016   

revenue increased 425 million  or 22  primarily due to 427 million in revenue from sales of blue coat network protection products due to the fair value adjustment of deferred revenue as a result of the accounting for the blue coat acquisition we excluded revenue of 116 million in the postacquisition period in addition services revenue increased 16 million while revenue from sales of endpoint management solutions decreased 23 million operating income increased 85 million  or 83  primarily due to increased revenue a reduction of expenses from new and ongoing cost savings initiatives and favorable currency fluctuations of 16 million and a decrease in unallocated corporate charges of 22 million these increases were partially offset by increased expenses associated with the blue coat acquisition in the postacquisition period and acquired inventory writeup related to the blue coat acquisition of 24 million 

2016  compared to 2015   

revenue decreased 139 million or 7 primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations of 90 million as well as decrease in sales of endpoint management solutions and our mail cloud security products operating income decreased 191 million or 65 primarily due to decreased revenue and increased allocation of stranded costs these stranded costs consist of overhead expenses resulting from the sale of veritas and primarily include information technology infrastructure and services and real estate costs in addition revenue decreased partially due to the impact of the additional week from the 53week fiscal 2015 year 

consumer digital safety segment by fiscal year 

our consumer digital safety segment focuses making it simple for customers to be productive and protected at home and at work the following tables are in millions except for percentage of revenues 

                     

2017  compared to 2016   

revenue decreased 6 million  primarily due to a decline in revenue from sales of nortonbranded products of 73 million as the revenue generated from customer additions was not sufficient to replace revenue lost through customer attrition the decline was largely offset by a 67 million increase in revenue due to the acquisition of lifelock due to the fair value adjustment of deferred revenue as a result of the accounting for the lifelock acquisition we excluded revenue of 28 million in the postacquisition period while the trend of declining revenues from sales of nortonbranded products continued in fiscal 2017 we began to benefit from the shift to subscriptionbased contracts resulting in a lower decline in fiscal 2017 as compared to the prior two fiscal years operating income decreased 85 million  or 9  primarily due to the norton revenue decline coupled with a loss from lifelock’s operations lifelock’s operating loss was a result of the deferred revenue fair value writedown 

2016  compared to 2015   

revenue decreased 217 million or 11 primarily due to new norton customer acquisition not being sufficient to replace norton customers lost through natural attrition and a reduction in revenue from oem arrangements unfavorable currency fluctuations of 81 million also contributed to the decline in revenue operating income decreased 58 million or 6 primarily due to the decreases in revenue in this segment which were partially offset by reductions in cost of revenue sales and marketing and research and development expenses 

net revenues by geographical region by fiscal year 

revenue by country as presented below is based on the billing location of the customer 



note americas include us canada and latin america emea includes europe middle east and africa apj includes asia pacific and japan 

2017  compared to 2016   

fluctuations in the us dollar compared to foreign currencies favorably impacted our international revenue by approximately 20 million for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 fiscal 2017 revenue for the apj region was favorably impacted by foreign currency fluctuations of 33 million fiscal 2017 revenue for the emea region was unfavorably impacted by foreign currency fluctuations of 13 million 

2016  compared to 2015   

fluctuations in the us dollar compared to foreign currencies unfavorably impacted our international revenue by approximately 171 million for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 fiscal 2016 revenue for the emea and apj regions decreased primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations of 119 million and 49 million respectively compared to fiscal 2015 

our international sales are expected to continue to be a significant portion of our revenue as a result we expect revenue to continue to be affected by foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the us dollar we are unable to predict the extent to which revenue in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates if international sales become a greater portion of our total sales in the future changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenue and operating results 

cost of revenues by fiscal year 

cost of revenues consists primarily of technical support costs costs of billable services fees to oems under revenuesharing agreements hardware costs and fulfillment costs as well as intangible asset amortization and is presented below in millions except for percentage of revenues 

                                          

2017  compared to 2016   

our cost of revenues increased 238 million  primarily due to 122 million of increased amortization related to the acquired blue coat and lifelock intangible assets and other costs related to sales of the acquired blue coat and lifelock products including an acquired product inventory fair value writeup of 24 million these increases in cost of revenues were partially offset by a decrease in unallocated corporate charges of 22 million 

2016  compared to 2015   

our cost of revenues decreased 112 million  primarily due to favorable currency effects a decrease in oem royalty fees and a decrease in service related and content delivery expenses 

operating expenses by fiscal year 

the following charts are in millions except for percentage of revenues 

2017  compared to 2016   

sales and marketing expense increased 167 million  primarily as a result of the acquisitions of blue coat and lifelock increased stockbased compensation expense of 54 million  and increased integration expense of 24 million these increases were partially offset by a reduction of expenses from new and ongoing cost savings initiatives and decreased unallocated corporate charges of 88 million 

research and development expense increased 75 million  primarily as a result of the acquisition of blue coat and an increase of 54 million  of stockbased compensation expense these increases were partially offset by a reduction of expenses from new and ongoing cost savings initiatives and decreased unallocated corporate charges of 44 million 

general and administrative expense increased 269 million  primarily as a result of the acquisition of blue coat and an increase of 160 million  of stockbased compensation expense in addition we incurred increased acquisitionrelated and integration expenses of 79 million these increases were partly offset by a reduction of expenses from new and ongoing cost savings initiatives and decreased unallocated corporate charges of 32 million 

our stockbased compensation in operating expenses increased 268 million  primarily due to the equity awards assumed in the blue coat and lifelock acquisitions and the expected level of achievement for performancebased restricted stock units 

“prus” granted in fiscal 2017 our stockbased compensation expense will continue to fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including the achievement levels of pru performance conditions 

amortization of intangible assets increased 90 million  primarily due to the intangible assets of 29 billion acquired in the blue coat and lifelock acquisitions 

2016  compared to 2015   

sales and marketing expense decreased 358 million  primarily due to a reduction of unallocated corporate charges of 328 million 

research and development expense decreased 64 million  primarily due to a reduction of unallocated corporate charges of 76 million 

general and administrative expenses decreased 67 million  primarily due to a reduction of unallocated corporate charges of 91 million partially offset by an increase in stockbased compensation expense 

amortization of intangible assets decreased 30 million  primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2015 

restructuring separation transition and other 

we initiated a restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 to reduce complexity by means of longterm structural improvements we expect to reduce headcount and close certain facilities in connection with the restructuring plan these actions are expected to be completed in fiscal 2018 on an annual basis we expect this restructuring plan to generate net cost efficiencies and cost synergies which when completed will favorably impact our continuing operating expenses in excess of 550 million as of march 31 2017  in connection with this restructuring plan we expect to incur approximately 240 million to 290 million in expenses in fiscal 2018 

additionally we expect continuing significant transition costs associated with the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system and costs to automate business processes as well as significant charges related to the integration of blue coat and lifelock 

see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our restructuring separation transition and other related costs 

nonoperating expense net by fiscal year 

the following charts are in millions 

2017  compared to 2016   

nonoperating expense net increased 97 million  to 162 million  from 65 million  as of march 31 2017  and april 1 2016  respectively primarily driven by an increase in interest expense of 133 million mainly related to our increased borrowings in fiscal 2017 the nonoperating expense net increase was partially offset by increased income from transition service agreements “tsa” of 14 million pursuant to which we provided veritas certain limited services see note 8  and note 13  to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our debt and tsas 

2016  compared to 2015   

nonoperating expense net increased 12 million primarily due to net foreign currency remeasurement losses 

provision for income taxes by fiscal year 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and international tax jurisdictions a substantial portion of our international earnings were generated from subsidiaries organized in ireland and singapore our results of operations would be adversely affected to the extent that our geographical mix of income becomes more weighted toward 

jurisdictions with higher tax rates and would be favorably affected to the extent the relative geographic mix shifts to lower tax jurisdictions any change in our mix of earnings is dependent upon many factors and is therefore difficult to predict see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

the following charts are in millions except for percentages 

                     

2017  compared to 2016   

the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2017  as compared to 2016  was primarily driven by tax expense of 11 billion in 2016  for providing us taxes on certain undistributed foreign earnings primarily those attributable to the sale of veritas partially offset by tax expense of 52 million in 2017 related to the loss of tax attributes as a result of restructuring activities 

2016  compared to 2015   

the increase in our effective tax rate in 2016  compared to 2015  was primarily driven by 11 billion of tax expense in 2016 for providing us taxes on certain undistributed foreign earnings primarily those attributable to the sale of veritas 

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and uses of cash 

we have historically relied on cash flow from operations borrowings under credit facilities issuances of debt and equity securities and sale of business more recently for our liquidity needs as of march 31 2017  we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 43 billion  of which 9 million  is included in our other current assets we also have an unused credit facility of 10 billion  resulting in a liquidity position of approximately 53 billion  as of march 31 2017  33 billion  in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries we have provided us deferred taxes on a portion of our undistributed foreign earnings sufficient to address the incremental us tax that would be due if we needed such portion of these funds to support our operations in the us 

our principal cash requirements primarily consists of acquisitions payment of taxes operating expenses and working capital capital expenditures payment of principal and interest on debt and restructuring and integration costs also we may engage from time to time in the open market purchase of our notes prior to their maturity furthermore our capital allocation strategy contemplates a quarterly cash dividend in addition we regularly evaluate our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock 

cash flows 

the following charts summarize cash provided by used in our consolidated statements of cash flows for fiscal 2015  2016  and 2017  in millions 

continuing operating activities 

our primary source of cash from continuing operating activities has been from cash collections from our customers due to seasonality our orders are generally higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and lower in our first and second fiscal quarters we therefore expect cash inflows from continuing operating activities to be affected by fluctuations in billings and timing of collections 

our primary uses of cash from our continuing operating activities include payments for income taxes payments for compensation and related costs payments to our resellers and distribution partners and other general corporate expenditures 

the change in continuing operating activities in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  was primarily due to the cash payment for taxes of 887 million as a result of the gain on sale from the divestiture of veritas changes in working capital and lower income from continuing operations adjusted for noncash items 

the change in continuing operating activities in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  was primarily due to changes in working capital and higher income from continuing operations adjusted for noncash items 

restructuring plan  we initiated a restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 to reduce complexity by means of longterm structural improvements we expect to reduce headcount and close certain facilities in connection with this restructuring plan the total remaining cash payments in connection with the restructuring plan are expected to be approximately 270 million to 305 million these actions are expected to be completed in fiscal 2018 see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our restructuring plans 

continuing investing activities 

our investing cash flows consist primarily of acquisitions capital expenditures and investment purchases sales and maturities the change in continuing investing activities in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  was primarily due to the net cash consideration paid for our acquisitions of blue coat and lifelock during fiscal 2017 of 45 billion  and 22 billion  respectively in addition our investing activities decreased due to the absence of proceeds from the divestiture of veritas of 65 billion  in fiscal 2016 and reduced proceeds from maturities and sales of shortterm investments of 13 billion the decrease was partially offset by reduced purchases of shortterm investments of 378 million during fiscal 2016 

the change in continuing investing activities in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  was primarily due to proceeds received from the divestiture of veritas of 65 billion increased proceeds from maturities and sales of shortterm investments of 331 million and decreases in our purchases of shortterm investments of 14 billion 

dissenter shares  as of march 31 2017  we have accrued 68 million for dissenting shareholders as a result of our lifelock acquisition 

shortterm investments  in order to achieve greater investment diversification and higher yields while maintaining our objectives of preservation of capital liquidity and safety we plan to increase our holdings of shortterm investments 

continuing financing activities 

our financing cash flows consist primarily of issuance and repayment of debt repurchases of common stock and payment of dividends and dividend equivalents to stockholders in fiscal 2017  our financing activities provided 53 billion  of cash compared to 47 billion  use of cash in fiscal 2016  the change in fiscal 2017  was primarily driven by our borrowing activities with net proceeds of 61 billion  partially offset by reduction in stock repurchases of 14 billion  and decrease in quarterly dividend payments from 015 per share in fiscal 2016  to 0075 per share in fiscal 2017  the dividend payments in fiscal 2016  also included a special dividend of 400  per share subsequent to the divestiture of veritas 

the change in continuing financing activities in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  was primarily due to increased cash dividends and dividend equivalent payments of 26 billion increased repurchases of common stock of 13 billion and an increase in the repayment of maturing senior notes and other obligations of 347 million partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes of 500 million 

we have made and may from time to time in the future make optional repayments of our debt obligations which may include repurchases of our outstanding debt depending on various factors such as market conditions 

interest payments on 37 billion of our variablerate borrowings are subject to change based on market interest rates 

borrowings  proceeds from and repayments of borrowings fluctuate from year to year based on the amounts paid to fund acquisitions and debt repayments the charts below set forth total debt issued repaid and the amount of unused credit facility for fiscal 2015  2016  and 2017  in millions 

credit ratings  our credit ratings were lowered as a result of the debt we incurred due to the lifelock acquisition our borrowing costs depend in part on our credit ratings and any further actions taken by these credit rating agencies to lower our credit ratings will likely increase our borrowing costs 

see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our debt repayments and borrowings 

prepayments of debt  subsequent to march 31 2017  we prepaid 710 million of our senior term loan a5 and 100 million of our senior term loan a1 on april 5 2017 and may 5 2017 respectively 

share repurchases and dividends  under our stock repurchase programs we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through open market and through asr transactions on november 20 2016 our board of directors increased the authorization under our stock repurchase program by 510  million in march 2017 we entered into asr agreements with financial institutions the “march 2017 asr” to repurchase an aggregate 500 million of our common stock the remaining 800 million authorization to be completed in future periods does not have an expiration date 

 on may 10 2017  we declared a cash dividend of 0075  per share of common stock to be paid on june 21 2017  to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on june 7 2017  all shares of common stock issued and outstanding and unvested rsus and prus as of the record date will be entitled to the dividend and dividend equivalents respectively any future dividends and dividend equivalents will be subject to the approval of our board of directors 

the chart below sets forth information on our share repurchases and dividends and dividend equivalents paid in fiscal 2015  2016  and 2017  in millions 

see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our share repurchases and dividends and dividend equivalents 

contractual obligations 

the following is a schedule by years of our significant contractual obligations as of march 31 2017  





 due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits as of march 31 2017  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities therefore 251 million  in longterm income taxes payable has been excluded from the contractual obligations table see note 5  to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

indemnifications 

in the ordinary course of business we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers vendors lessors business partners subsidiaries and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of agreements or representations and warranties made by us refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our indemnifications 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our financial position and the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements some of these policies required us to make subjective estimates and apply judgment regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 

our most critical estimates included 

 see note 1  to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report for further information on our critical accounting estimates and policies 

recently issued authoritative guidance 

revenue recognition  contracts with customers  in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued new authoritative guidance for revenue from contracts with customers the standard’s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services in doing so companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current guidance these may include identifying performance obligations in the contract estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation in march 2016 the fasb clarified implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in april 2016 the fasb issued guidance related to identifying performance obligations and licensing which reduces the cost and complexity of applying certain aspects of the guidance both at implementation and on an ongoing basis 

the new guidance may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented “retrospective” or retrospectively with cumulative effect recognized in retained earnings as of the date of adoption “modified retrospective” we expect to adopt the new standard on a modified retrospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements 

financial instruments  recognition and measurement  in january 2016 the fasb issued new authoritative guidance on financial instruments the new guidance enhances the reporting model for financial instruments which includes amendments to address aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure the new guidance will be effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2019 early adoption is permitted under limited circumstances but we do not intend to adopt the provisions of the new guidance early we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements 

leases  in february 2016 the fasb issued new guidance on lease accounting which will require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on their balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by operating leases and will also require disclosures designed to give users of financial statements information on the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases the new guidance will be effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2020 early adoption is permitted but we do not plan to adopt the provisions of the new guidance early we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements 

employee stockbased compensation  in march 2016 the fasb issued new guidance on accounting for employee stockbased compensation which requires all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled as well as revising guidance related to classification of awards as either equity or liabilities accounting for forfeitures and classification of excess tax benefits or deficiencies on the statement of cash flows we are electing to continue to estimate forfeitures to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period we do not anticipate a material impact on the consolidated financial statements from the cumulative effect of these changes the new guidance will be effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2018 

credit losses  in june 2016 the fasb issued new authoritative guidance on credit losses which changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments for trade receivables and other instruments we will be required to use a new forwardlooking “expected loss” model additionally for availableforsale debt securities with unrealized losses we will measure credit losses in a manner similar to today except that the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than 

reductions in the amortized cost of the securities the standard will be effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2021 we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements 

income taxes  intraentity asset transfers other than inventory in october 2016 the fasb issued new authoritative guidance that requires entities to immediately recognize the tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers excluding inventory at the transaction date rather than deferring the tax consequences under current us gaap the standard will be effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2019 and requires a modified retrospective transition method we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance and anticipate it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies we do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

as of march 31 2017  we had 46 billion  in principal amount of fixedrate senior notes and convertible senior notes outstanding with a carrying amount of 46 billion  and a fair value of 46 billion  based on level 2 inputs as of april 1 2016  we had 23 billion  in principal amount of fixedrate senior notes outstanding with a carrying amount of 22 billion  and a fair value of 23 billion  based on level 2 inputs 

we have considered the historical volatility of interest rates and determined that it is possible that adverse changes in interest rates related to our fixed and variable rate debt could occur a reasonably possible hypothetical adverse change of 50basis points could result in a 92 million fair value reduction of our fixedrate borrowings as of march 31 2017  compared to a 41 million fair value reduction as of april 1 2016  a reasonably possible hypothetical adverse change of 50basis points in the effective interest rate of our 37 billion of variablerate borrowings could result in an incremental 19 million of pretax interest expense on an annualized basis 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we conduct business in numerous currencies through our worldwide operations and as such we are exposed to foreign currency risk our entities conduct their businesses in the primary local currency in which they operate however they may also conduct business in other currencies to the extent our entities hold monetary assets or liabilities earn revenues or incur costs in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency they are exposed to foreign exchange gains or losses and impacts to margins as a result as part of our foreign currency risk mitigation strategy we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts with up to six months in duration to help mitigate foreign exchange risk however we are not able to mitigate all of our foreign exchange risk we have considered historical trends in exchange rates and determined that it is possible that adverse changes in exchange rates for any currency could occur the estimated impacts of a ten percent appreciation or depreciation of foreign currency are as follows in millions 

we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of the changes in foreign exchange rates

after closing the divestiture of our  information management business veritas  as the world leader in cybersecurity we are more focused than ever on the following priorities delivering upon our unified security strategy building our enterprise security pipeline and gotomarket capabilities improving our cost structure and fulfilling our commitment to allocate capital to our stockholders   

divestiture of veritas   

  in august 2015 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the assets of  veritas to the carlyle group and certain coinvestors carlyle the transaction closed on january 29 2016 at which time we received net consideration of 66 billion in cash excluding transaction costs and 40 million b common shares of veritas and veritas assumed certain liabilities we now have two reporting segments consumer security and enterprise security 

business highlights 

during fiscal 2016 we took the following actions in support of our business 



 operating segments and products 

our operating segments are significant strategic business units that offer different products and services distinguished by customer needs the two reporting segments which are the same as our operating segments are  consumer security and enterprise security 

consumer security 

our consumer security segment focuses on making it simple for customers to be productive and protected at home and at work our nortonbranded services provide multilayer security and identity protection on major desktop and mobile operating systems to defend against increasingly complex online threats to individuals families and small businesses   

our norton security products help customers protect against increasingly complex threats and address the need for identity protection while also managing the rapid increase in mobile and digital data such as personal financial records photos music and videos 

enterprise security 

our enterprise security segment protects organizations so they can securely conduct business while leveraging new platforms and data our enterprise security segment includes our threat protection products information protection products cyber security services and website security offerings previously named trust services 

these products and services help our customers secure their information in transit and wherever it resides in the network path from the user’s device to the data’s resting place these products protect customer data from sophisticated threats such as advanced protection threats malicious spam and phishing attacks malware driveby website infections hackers and cyber criminals in addition these products help to prevent the loss of confidential data by insiders and help customers achieve and maintain compliance with laws and regulations our enterprise endpoint security and management offerings support the evolving endpoint providing advanced threat protection while helping reduce cost and complexity these solutions are delivered through various methods such as software appliance softwareasaservice saas and managed services

sales and gotomarket strategy 

our gotomarket network includes direct sales forces and broad ecommerce capabilities as well as indirect sales resources that support our global partner ecosystem we also maintain important relationships with a number of original equipment manufacturers “oems” internet service providers “isps” and retail and online stores through which we market and sell our products 

our dedicated renewals team remains focused on extending customer relationships and renewing customer contracts with us we also continued to streamline our indirect sales strategy to have fewer more focused partners with specialized partner programs to enhance sales we believe these changes provide customers with a highquality sales and postsales support experience while also enabling us to expand our business 

consumer 

we sell and market our consumer products and services to individuals households and small businesses globally we bring these products to market through our ecommerce platform distributors direct marketers internetbased resellers system builders isps wireless carriers and retailers worldwide we also maintain a limited number of partnerships with oems globally to distribute our internet security and online backup offerings 

commercial 

we sell and market our products and related services to small medium and large customers through field sales and inside sales forces that leverage indirect sales partners around the world that are specifically trained and certified to sell our solutions these partners include national solution providers regional solution providers national account resellers globalfederal system integrators and managed service providers our products and services are also available on our ecommerce platform as well as through authorized distributors and oems who incorporate our technologies into their products bundle our products with their offerings or serve as authorized resellers of our products 

enterprise 

we sell and market our products and related services to large enterprises including government and public sector customers through our field sales force this field sales team is responsible for leveraging our global partner ecosystem primarily targeting senior executives and it department personnel responsible for managing a company’s highestorder it initiatives 

research and development 

symantec embraces a global research and development strategy to drive organic innovation our engineers and researchers are focused on delivering new versions of existing product lines as well as developing entirely new offerings to drive the company’s leadership in cybersecurity we also have a technology research organization focused on short medium and longerterm applied research projects with the goal of transferring completed innovations into our product groups for commercialization 

symantec’s security technology and response organization consists of a global team of security engineers threat analysts and researchers that provide the underlying functionality content and support for many of our consumer commercial and enterprise security products our security experts analyze threat telemetry collected through symantec’s massive global sensor network one of the largest cyber intelligence networks in the world to protect our customers against current and emerging threats our research and development teams also leverage this vast amount of data and related insights to develop new technologies and approaches including our unified security analytics platform in order to improve security outcomes for our customers 

research and development expenses were 748 million  812 million  and 722 million  in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively representing approximately 21  21  and 17  of revenue in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the percentage fluctuates between periods as a result of a variety of factors including changes in sales level and foreign currency exchange rates we believe that technical leadership is essential to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development 

support 

symantec has support facilities throughout the world staffed by technical product experts knowledgeable in the operating environments in which our products are deployed our technical support experts assist customers with issue resolution and threat detection 

we provide consumers with various levels of support offerings consumers receive automatic downloads of the latest virus definitions application bug fixes and patches for most of our consumer products our consumer support program provides selfhelp online services and phone chat and email support to consumers worldwide in addition our norton security products come with a “virus protection promise” which in some markets provides free virus removal services to customers whose protected computers become infected 

we provide customers various levels of enterprise support offerings our enterprise security support program offers annual maintenance support contracts including content upgrades and technical support our standard technical support includes selfservice options delivered by telephone or electronically during the contractedfor hours immediate patches for severe problems periodic software updates and access to our technical knowledge base and frequently asked questions 

significant customers 

in each of fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  no customer accounted for more than 10 of our total net revenues one distributor accounted for 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of april 1 2016 

acquisitions 

our strategy will be complemented by business combinations that fit strategically and meet specific profitability hurdles our acquisitions are designed to enhance the features and functionality of our existing products and extend our product leadership in core markets we consider timetomarket synergies with existing products and potential market share gains when evaluating the economics of acquisitions of technologies product lines or companies we may acquire or dispose of other technologies products and companies in the future 

we did not make any material acquisitions during fiscal 2016 

competition 

our markets are consolidating highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology the competitive landscape has changed significantly over the past few years with new competition arising much of the market growth has come from startups whose focus is on solving a specific customer issue or delivering a nicheoriented product and from larger integration providers that increasingly are looking to put various types of protection into their platforms we are focused on delivering comprehensive customer solutions integrating across our broad product portfolio and partnering with other technology providers to differentiate ourselves from the competition we believe that the principal competitive factors necessary to be successful in our industry include product quality and effectiveness timetomarket price reputation financial stability breadth of product offerings customer support brand recognition and effective sales and marketing efforts 

in addition to the competition we face from direct competitors we face indirect or potential competition from retailers application providers operating system providers network equipment manufacturers and other oems who may provide various solutions and functions in their current and future products we also compete for access to retail distribution channels and for spending at the retail level and in corporate accounts in addition we compete with other software companies operating system providers network equipment manufacturers and other oems to acquire technologies products or companies and to publish software developed by third parties we also compete with other software companies in our effort to place our products on the computer equipment sold to consumers and enterprises by oems 

most of the channels in which our products are offered are highly competitive some of our consumer competitors are intensely focused on customer acquisition which has led competitors to offer their technology for free engage in aggressive marketing or enter into competitive partnerships our primary security competitors are intel corporation microsoft corporation “microsoft” and trend micro inc there are also several freeware providers and regional security companies that we compete against for our consumer backup offerings our primary competitors are carbonite inc and emc corporation in the secure socket layer certificate market our primary competitors are comodo group inc and godaddycom inc in the saas security market our primary competitors are proofpoint and microsoft our primary competitors in the managed security services business are secureworks corporation and ibm corporation 

intellectual property 

protective measures 

we regard some of the features of our internal operations software and documentation as proprietary and rely on copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures contractual arrangements and other measures to protect our proprietary information our intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that enables us to gain recognition for our products services and technology and enhance our competitive position 

as part of our confidentiality procedures we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with our employees distributors and corporate partners and we enter into license agreements with respect to our software documentation and other proprietary information these license agreements are generally nontransferable and have either a perpetual or subscription based time limited term we also educate our employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to protect our facilities equipment and networks 

trademarks patents copyrights and licenses 

symantec and the symantec logo are trademarks or registered trademarks in the us and other countries in addition to symantec and the symantec logo we have used registered or applied to register other specific trademarks and service marks to help distinguish our products technologies and services from those of our competitors in the us and foreign countries and jurisdictions we enforce our trademark service mark and trade name rights in the us and abroad the duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country and in the us we generally are able to maintain our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in use 

we have more than 1700 patents in addition to foreign patents and pending us and foreign patent applications which relate to various aspects of our products and technology the duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and for the us is typically 17 years from the date of issuance of the patent or 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application resulting in the patent which we believe is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products 

our products are protected under us and international copyright laws and laws related to the protection of intellectual property and proprietary information we take measures to label such products with the appropriate proprietary rights notices and we actively enforce such rights in the us and abroad however these measures may not provide sufficient protection and our intellectual property rights may be challenged in addition we license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our products and generally must rely on the third party to protect the licensed intellectual property rights while we believe that our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent trademark license or other intellectual property right 

seasonality 

as is typical for many large technology companies our business is seasonal orders are generally higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and lower in our first and second fiscal quarters revenue generally reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than orders because revenue is not recognized until an order is shipped or services are performed and other revenue recognition criteria are met and because a significant portion of our inperiod revenue comes from our deferred revenue balance 

employees 

as of april 1 2016 we employed more than 11000 people worldwide approximately 46 of whom reside in the us approximately 3000 employees work in sales and marketing 4000 in research and development 2000 in support and services and 2000 in management and administration

for the last few years we have experienced a number of transitions as we have attempted to revitalize our business model improve execution and innovate new products and services these transitions have involved significant turnover in management and other key personnel changes in our strategic direction and more recently the divestiture of veritas transitions of the magnitude we have experienced and are experiencing can be disruptive result in loss of institutional focus and employee morale and make the execution of business strategies more difficult we are also focused on addressing dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the continued decline in the pc market the market shifts towards mobility the transition towards cloudbased solutions and architectural shifts in the provision of security all of which has made it more difficult for us to compete effectively and requires us to improve our product and service offerings we may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our efforts to address these challenges and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs in addition we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with these efforts and the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate if we do not succeed in these efforts or if these efforts are more costly or timeconsuming than expected our business and results of operations may be adversely affected which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business 

we may not achieve the intended benefits of the divestiture of veritas 

on january 29 2016 we completed the divestiture of veritas however we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the transaction the resource constraints as a result of our prior focus on completing the transaction which included the loss of employees could have a continuing impact on the execution of our business strategy and our overall operating results additionally in connection with the divestiture our board of directors committed to returning the proceeds of the sale of veritas to stockholders in the form of a capital return program which included the payment of a special dividend in march 2016 entry into multiple share accelerated transactions and continued repurchases under current and future share repurchase programs the use of proceeds in this manner could impair the company’s future financial growth 

fluctuations in demand for our products and services are driven by many factors and a decrease in demand for our products could adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and services due to a variety of factors including market transitions general economic conditions competition product obsolescence technological change shifts in buying patterns financial difficulties and budget constraints of our current and potential customers awareness of security threats to it systems and other factors while such factors may in some periods increase product sales fluctuations in demand can also negatively impact our product sales if demand for our products and solutions declines whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in buying patterns our revenues and margins would likely be adversely affected 

our business depends  on customers renewing their arrangements for maintenance subscriptions managed security services and saas offerings 

a large portion of our revenue is derived from arrangements for maintenance subscriptions managed security services and saas offerings yet existing customers have no contractual obligation to purchase additional solutions after the initial subscription or contract period our customers’ renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including their level of satisfaction with our solutions or our customer support customer budgets and the pricing of our solutions compared with the solutions offered by our competitors any of which may cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected if at all accordingly we must invest significant time and resources in providing ongoing value to our customers if these efforts fail or if our customers do not renew for other reasons or if they renew on terms less favorable to us our revenue may decline and our business will suffer 

any cost reduction initiatives that we undertake may not deliver the results we expect and these actions may adversely affect our business   

in may 2016 we announced a fiscal 2017 restructuring plan to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2018 this initiative could result in disruptions to our operations any costcutting measures could also negatively impact our business by delaying the introduction of new products or technologies interrupting service of additional products or impacting employee retention in addition we cannot be sure that the cost reduction and streamlining initiatives will be as successful in reducing our overall expenses as we expect or that additional costs will not offset any such reductions or streamlining if our operating costs are higher than we expect or if we do not maintain adequate control of our costs and expenses our results of operations will suffer 

if we are unable to develop new and enhanced products and services that achieve widespread market acceptance or if we are unable to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our existing products and services or adapt our business model to keep pace with industry trends our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our future success depends on our ability to respond to the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing or introducing new products product upgrades and services on a timely basis we have in the past incurred and will continue to incur significant research and development expenses as we strive to remain competitive additionally we must continually address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the emergence of advanced persistent threats in the security space the continued decline in the pc market and the market shift towards mobility and the increasing transition towards cloudbased solutions all of which have made it more difficult for us to compete effectively customers may require features and capabilities that our current solutions do not have our failure to develop solutions that satisfy customer preferences in a timely and costeffective manner may harm our ability to renew our subscriptions with existing customers and to create or increase demand for our solutions and may adversely impact our operating results new product development and introduction involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including 



licenses for certain products with deep technical integration into operating systems 

if we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges or if our new products product upgrades and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

we operate in a highly competitive environment and our competitors may gain market share in the markets for our products that could adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to decline 

we operate in intensely competitive markets that experience rapid technological developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements if we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a decline in our sales that could adversely affect our business and operating results to compete successfully we must maintain an innovative research and development effort to develop new products and services and enhance existing products and services effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors appropriately respond to competitive strategies and effectively adapt to technological changes and changes in the ways that our information is accessed used and stored within our enterprise and consumer markets if we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors or to changing technological and customer demands our competitive position and our financial results could be adversely affected 

our competitors include software vendors that offer software products that directly compete with our product offerings in addition to competing with these vendors directly for sales to endusers of our products we compete with them for the opportunity to have our products bundled with the product offerings of our strategic partners such as computer hardware oems and isps our competitors could gain market share from us if any of these strategic partners replace our products with the products of our competitors or if these partners more actively promote our competitors’ products than our products in addition software vendors who have bundled our products with theirs may choose to bundle their software with their own or other vendors’ software or may limit our access to standard product interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop products for their platform in the future further product development by these vendors could cause our software applications and services to become redundant which could significantly impact our sales and financial results 

we face growing competition from network equipment computer hardware manufacturers large operating system providers and other technology companies that are increasingly developing and incorporating into their products data protection software that competes at some levels with our product offerings our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our products 

security protection is also offered by some of our competitors at prices lower than our prices or in some cases is offered free of charge some companies offer the lowerpriced or free security products within their computer hardware or software products that we believe are inferior to our products and saas offerings our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive these security products as replacing the need for more effective full featured products and services such as those that we provide the expansion of these competitive trends could have a significant negative impact on our sales and financial results by causing among other things price reductions of our products reduced profitability and loss of market share 

many of our competitors have greater financial technical sales marketing or other resources than we do and consequently may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their products instead of ours further consolidation within our industry or other changes in the competitive environment could result in larger competitors that compete with us on several levels we also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the markets in which we compete 

fluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected the price of our common stock in the past and could affect our stock price in the future 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts and investors our stock price could be negatively affected any volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance 

factors associated with our industry the operation of our business and the markets for our products may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate including 



 any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 

our business models present execution and competitive risks 

in recent years our saas offerings have become increasingly critical in our business our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying saas offerings for consumers and business customers pricing and delivery models are evolving devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own saas strategies we cannot assure you that our investments in and development of saas offerings will achieve the expected returns for us or that we will be able to compete successfully in the marketplace in addition to software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support saas offerings these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we are successful in this business model depends on our execution in a number of areas including 

 we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully 

the intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully any such changes may reduce margins and could adversely affect operating results additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud and saas delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact pricing in both our onpremise enterprise software business and our cloud business as well as overall demand for our onpremise 

software product and service offerings which could reduce our revenues and profitability our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings which could put pressure on us to further discount our product or support pricing 

any broadbased change to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products if we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand our revenues could decrease the increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing models 

defects disruptions or risks related to the provision of our saas offerings could impair our ability to deliver our services and could expose us to liability damage our brand and reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business 

our saas offerings may contain errors or defects that users identify after they begin using them that could result in unanticipated service interruptions which could harm our reputation and our business since our customers use our saas offerings for missioncritical protection from threats to electronic information endpoint devices and computer networks any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems with our saas offerings could significantly harm our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses if that occurs customers could elect not to renew or delay or withhold payment to us we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation 

we currently serve our saasbased customers from hosting facilities located across the globe damage to or failure of any significant element of these hosting facilities could result in interruptions in our service which could harm our customers and expose us to liability interruptions or failures in our service delivery could cause customers to terminate their subscriptions with us could adversely affect our renewal rates and could harm our ability to attract new customers our business would also be harmed if our customers believe that our saas offerings are unreliable 

we collect use disclose store or otherwise process personal information which subjects us to privacy and data security laws and contractual commitments and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and commitments could harm our business 

the personal information we collect use store or disclose collectively “process” including from employees and customers is subject to an increasing number of federal state local and foreign laws regarding privacy and data security as well as contractual commitments any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions fines litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business our customers may also accidentally disclose their passwords or store them on a device that is lost or stolen creating the perception that our systems are not secure against thirdparty access additionally if third parties that we work with such as vendors or developers violate applicable laws or our policies such violations may also place personal information at risk and have an adverse effect on our business changes to applicable privacy or data security laws could impact how we process personal information and therefore limit the effectiveness of our products services or features or our ability to develop new products services or features 

if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to their customers our operating results could be adversely affected 

we sell our products to customers around the world through multitiered sales and distribution networks sales through these different channels involve distinct risks including the following 

direct sales  a significant portion of our revenues from enterprise products is derived from sales by our direct sales force to endusers special risks associated with direct sales include 

 indirect sales channels  a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels including distributors that sell our products to endusers and other resellers this channel involves a number of risks including 



 oem sales channels  a portion of our revenues is derived from sales through our oem partners that incorporate our products into or bundle our products with their products our reliance on this sales channel involves many risks including 

 if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels successfully these channels may conflict with one another or otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate which could reduce our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our competitive position some of our distribution partners have experienced financial difficulties in the past and if our partners suffer financial difficulties in the future because of general economic conditions or for other reasons these partners may delay paying their obligations to us and we may have reduced sales or increased bad debt expense that could adversely affect our operating results in addition reliance on multiple channels subjects us to events that could cause unpredictability in demand which could increase the risk that we may be unable to plan effectively for the future and could result in adverse operating results in future periods 

over the long term we intend to invest in research and development activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results 

while we continue to focus on managing our costs and expenses over the long term we also intend to invest significantly in research and development activities as we focus on organic growth through internal innovation in each of our business segments we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position we recognize the costs associated with these research and development investments earlier than the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or  businesses  and asset impairments 

in response to changes in industry and market conditions and in connection with the recent divestiture of veritas we may be required to strategically reallocate our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel reschedule or adjust with contract manufacturers and suppliers 

further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to evaluate goodwill impairment on an annual basis and between annual evaluations in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment evaluations may result in a charge to earnings 

our inability to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity event could impair our ability to deliver our products and services and harm our business 

we are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure to provide our products and services to our customers for example we host many of our products using thirdparty data center facilities and we do not control the operation of these facilities these facilities are vulnerable to damage interruption or performance problems from earthquakes hurricanes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they are also subject to breakins computer viruses sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in the delivery of our products and services 

furthermore our business administration human resources and finance services depend on the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations a disruption or failure of these systems or operations because of a disaster or other business continuity event could cause data to be lost or otherwise delay our ability to complete sales and provide the highest level of service to our customers in addition we could have difficulty producing accurate financial statements on a timely basis which could adversely affect the trading value of our stock although we endeavor to ensure there is redundancy in these systems and that they are regularly backedup there are no assurances that data recovery in the event of a disaster would be effective or occur in an efficient manner 

any errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our products and services could harm our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses for example we may experience disruptions outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors including infrastructure changes human or software errors capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our website simultaneously fraud or security attacks in some instances we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time interruptions in our products and services could impact our revenues or cause customers to cease doing business with us in addition our business would be harmed if any of events of this nature caused our customers and potential customers to believe our services are unreliable our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we could potentially lose customer data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario 

we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions which gives rise to risks and challenges that could adversely affect our future financial results 

we have in the past acquired and we expect to acquire in the future other businesses business units and technologies acquisitions can involve a number of special risks and challenges including 

 if integration of our acquired businesses is not successful we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects to integrate acquired businesses we must implement our technology systems in the acquired operations and integrate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations we also must effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired business organizations into our own in a way that aligns various interests and may need to enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions 

any of the foregoing and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from our acquired businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of acquisitions 

our international operations  involve risks that could increase our expenses adversely affect our operating results and require increased time and attention of our management 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the us and we have significant operations outside of the us including engineering sales customer support and production we plan to expand our international operations but such expansion is contingent upon our identification of growth opportunities our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations including 

 a significant portion of our transactions outside of the us is denominated in foreign currencies accordingly our revenues and expenses will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates for example in recent periods the us dollar has strengthened significantly against the euro and other major currencies which has adversely impacted our reported international revenue we expect to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future especially if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales or our operations outside the us continue to increase 

the level of corporate income tax from sales to our nonus customers is generally less than the level of tax from sales to our us customers this benefit is contingent upon existing tax regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits 

our products are complex and operate in a wide variety of environments systems applications and configurations which could result in errors or product failures 

because we offer very complex products undetected errors failures or bugs may occur especially when products are first introduced or when new versions are released our products are often installed and used in largescale computing environments with different operating systems system management software and equipment and networking configurations which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors failures or bugs in our products our customers’ computing environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and nonstandard configurations that make prerelease testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and timeconsuming in addition despite testing by us and others errors failures or bugs may not be found in new products or releases until after commencement of commercial shipments in the past we have discovered software errors failures and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and in some cases have experienced delayed or lost revenues as a result of these errors 

errors failures or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity damage to our brand product returns loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products loss of competitive position or claims by customers or others many of 

our enduser customers use our products in applications that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other less critical software products in addition if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity security or availability occurs in one of our enduser customer’s systems regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions delays or cessation of our product licensing which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating results 

if we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology our financial results could be harmed 

most of our software and underlying technology is proprietary we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws however all of these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties third parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise obtain use distribute and sell our proprietary information without authorization 

third parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently by designing around our patents our shrink wrap license agreements are not signed by licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions furthermore the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the us and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries the unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could adversely affect our ability to access software operating system and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor or cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products to their customers in addition any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in could be costly may distract management from daytoday operations and may lead to additional claims against us which could adversely affect our operating results 

from time to time we are a party to lawsuits and investigations which typically require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses and which could if not determined favorably negatively impact our business financial condition results  of operations and cash flows 

we have been named as a party to lawsuits including patent litigation class actions and governmental claims and we may be named in additional litigation the expense of defending such litigation may be costly and divert management’s attention from the daytoday operations of our business which could adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows in addition an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could result in significant fines settlements monetary damages or injunctive relief that could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business results of operations and cash flows 

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

from time to time third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights including claims regarding patents copyrights and trademarks because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that the number of these claims may grow in addition former employers of our former current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers any such claim with or without merit could result in costly litigation and distract management from daytoday operations if we are not successful in defending such claims we could be required to stop selling delay shipments of or redesign our products pay monetary amounts as damages enter into royalty or licensing arrangements or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers we cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to investigate defend and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

in addition we license and use software from third parties in our business these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and may expose us to additional liability this liability or our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

adverse global economic events may impact our customers’ ability to do business with us thereby harming our business operating results and financial condition 

adverse macroeconomic conditions could negatively affect our customers thereby impacting our business operating results or financial condition during challenging economic times and periods of high unemployment current or potential customers 

may delay or forgo decisions to license new products or additional instances of existing products upgrade their existing hardware or operating environments which upgrades are often a catalyst for new purchases of our software or purchase services customers may also have difficulties in obtaining the requisite thirdparty financing to complete the purchase of our products and services any of these scenarios could adversely affect our business 

our exposure to credit risk and payment delinquencies on our accounts receivable significantly increases in adverse economic conditions 

an adverse macroeconomic environment could subject us to increased credit risk should customers be unable to pay us or delay paying us for previously purchased products and services our outstanding accounts receivables are generally not secured in addition our standard terms and conditions permit payment within a specified number of days following the receipt of our product accordingly reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase in addition weakness in the market for end users of our products could harm the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could then delay paying their obligations to us this would further increase our credit risk exposure and potentially cause delays in our recognition of revenue on sales to these customers further while no customer accounted for more than 10 of our total net revenues in each of fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 one distributor accounted for 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of april 1 2016 the loss of this or other large customers could have a negative impact on our business while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on our receivables and have not suffered any material losses to date there can be no assurance such procedures will continue to effectively limit our credit risk and avoid future losses 

we cannot predict our future capital needs and we may be unable to obtain financing which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the onset or continuation of adverse economic conditions may make it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations investing activities including potential acquisitions or financing activities any required financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all if we raise additional funds by obtaining loans from third parties the terms of those financing arrangements may include negative covenants or other restrictions on our business that could impair our financial or operational flexibility and would also require us to fund additional interest expense if additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to successfully develop or enhance our software and services through acquisitions in order to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures which could have a material adverse effect on our software and services offerings revenues results of operations and financial condition 

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity capital position ability to hedge certain financial risks borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

our credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies and such agencies have in the past and could in the future downgrade our ratings we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade may further impact us in a similar manner and may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position ability to hedge certain financial risks and access to capital markets 

our  financial  condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liabilities 

as a result of the sale of our 420 senior notes “420 notes due 2020” in september 2010 and our 275 senior notes “275 notes due 2017” and 395 senior notes “395 notes due 2022” in june 2012 and 250 convertible senior “250 senior convertible notes due 2021” in march 2016 we have notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of 23 billion that mature at specific dates in calendar years 2017 2020 2021 and 2022 in addition we have entered into a credit facility with a borrowing capacity of 10 billion from time to time in the future we may also incur indebtedness in addition to the amount available under our credit facility the maintenance of our debt levels could adversely affect our flexibility to take advantage of certain corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we may be required to use all or a substantial portion of our cash balance to repay these notes on maturity unless we can obtain new financing there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase in addition changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest we pay on outstanding or future debt these risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our software products saas offerings and website may be subject to intentional disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future sales 

despite our precautions and significant ongoing investments to protect against security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and other intentional disruptions of our products and offerings we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance and availability of our products and offerings and harm our reputation as a company similarly experienced computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our website and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an event could adversely affect our competitive position reputation brand and future sales of our products and our customers may assert claims against us related to resulting losses of confidential or proprietary information furthermore our employees or contractors may either intentionally or unintentionally subject us to information security risks and incidents our business could be subject to significant disruption and we could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm in the event of such incidents 

some of our products  contain “open source” software and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business 

certain of our products are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under socalled “open source” licenses which may include by way of example the gnu general public license gnu lesser general public license the mozilla public license the bsd license and the apache license some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use by the terms of certain open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner in addition to risks related to license requirements usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third party commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software we have established processes to help alleviate these risks including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products in addition many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated and could if not properly addressed negatively affect our business 

if we are unable to adequately address increased customer demands on our technical support services our relationships with our customers and our financial results may be adversely affected 

we offer technical support services with many of our products we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers further customer demand for these services without corresponding revenues could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results 

we have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide consumer support functions to third party service providers if these companies experience financial difficulties do not maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level under these contracts the level of support services to our customers may be significantly disrupted which could materially harm our relationships with these customers 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees lose key personnel fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully or fail to manage  our employee base effectively we may be unable to develop new and enhanced products and services effectively manage or expand our business or increase our revenues 

our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key management technical sales marketing finance and other personnel our officers and other key personnel are employeesatwill and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them competition for people with the specific skills that we require is significant and we face difficulties in attracting retaining and motivating employees as a result in connection with the divestiture of veritas we experienced employee attrition and related difficulties and these difficulties may continue or increase with the divestiture of veritas now complete in order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace we believe that we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees in addition we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation plans and accounting rules require us to treat the issuance of equitybased compensation as compensation expense as a result we may decide to issue fewer equitybased incentives and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees or conversely if we fail to manag 

e employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution from time to time key personnel leave our company and the incidence of this increased in recent periods due to the transitions we have experienced over the last few years including the divestiture of veritas for example we recently announced that for the third time in four years we are initiating a chief executive officer transition process and appointed an interim president and chief operating officer while we strive to reduce the negative impact of changes in our leadership the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and our results of operations in addition hiring training and successfully integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time consuming and expensive may cause additional disruptions to our operations and may be unsuccessful which could negatively impact future financial results these risks may be exacerbated by the uncertainty associated with the transitions we have experienced over the last few years 

our contracts with the us government include compliance audit and review obligations any failure to meet these obligations could result in civil damages andor penalties being assessed against us by the government 

 we sell products and services through government contracting programs directly and via partners though we no longer hold a gsa contract in the ordinary course of business sales under these government contracting programs may be subject to audit or investigation by the us government noncompliance identified as a result of such reviews as well as noncompliance identified on our own could subject us to damages and other penalties which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

accounting charges may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results 

our financial results have been in the past and may continue to be in the future materially affected by noncash and other accounting charges including 

 our effective tax rate may increase which could increase our income tax expense and reduce increase our net income loss 

our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

 the price of our common stock could decline if our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate 

we report our results of operations based on our determination of the aggregate amount of taxes owed in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate from time to time we receive notices that a tax authority in a particular jurisdiction believes that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority we are regularly engaged in discussions and sometimes disputes with these tax authorities we are engaged in disputes of this nature at this time if the ultimate 

determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our stock price may be volatile in the future and you could lose the value of your investment 

the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future and as a result you could lose the value of your investment the market price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including 

 the stock market in general and the market prices of stocks of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price volatility that has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results 

unforeseen catastrophic or other global  events could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we are a global company and conduct our business inside and outside the us our business operations and financial results could be adversely impacted by unforeseen catastrophic or other global events including an epidemic or a pandemic acts of war or terrorist attacks cyberattacks natural disasters or political unrest or turmoil unforeseen political turmoil military escalations and armed conflict pose a risk of economic disruption in the countries in which they occur and in other countries which may increase our operating costs such incidences of uncertainty could disrupt customers’ spending on our products and services which may adversely affect our revenue in addition our corporate headquarters are located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known for seismic activity a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake could have a material adverse impact on our business operations target markets operating results and financial condition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our business 

symantec corporation is a global leader in security we operate our business on a global civilian cyber intelligence threat network and track a vast number of threats across the internet from hundreds of millions of mobile devices endpoints and servers across the globe we believe one of our competitive advantages is our database of threat indicators which allows us to reduce the number of false positives and provide faster and better protection for customers through our products through the delivery of new and enhanced solutions we are integrating our security offerings across our portfolio we are also developing novel solutions in growing markets like cloud advanced threat protection information protection and cyber security services founded in 1982 symantec has operations in more than 35 countries and our principal executive offices are located at 350 ellis street mountain view california 94043 

fiscal calendar 

we have a 5253week fiscal year ending on the friday closest to march 31 unless otherwise stated references to years in this report relate to fiscal year and periods ended april 1 2016  april 3 2015  and march 28 2014  our fiscal 2016 and 2014 were 52week years whereas our fiscal 2015 was a 53week year 

strategy 

our security strategy is to deliver a unified security analytics platform that provides big data analytics utilizes our vast telemetry provides visibility into realtime global threats and powers symantec and thirdparty security analytics applications leverage this analytics platform to provide bestinclass consumer and enterprise security products and offer cyber security services that provide a fullsuite of services from monitoring to incident response to threat intelligence all supported by over 500 cyber security experts and nine global security response centers 

after closing the divestiture of veritas  as the world leader in cybersecurity we are more focused than ever on the following priorities delivering upon our unified security strategy building our enterprise security pipeline and gotomarket capabilities improving our cost structure and fulfilling our commitment to allocate capital to our stockholders 

divestiture of veritas 

in august 2015 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the assets of  veritas to carlyle and amended the terms in january 2016 based on the amended terms of the definitive agreement we received net consideration of 66 billion  in cash excluding transaction costs and 40 million  b common shares of veritas and veritas assumed certain liabilities in connection with the acquisition the transaction closed on january 29 2016 the disposition resulted in a net gain of 30 billion  which is presented as part of income from discontinued operations net of income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2016 see note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on severance facilities and separation costs related to our fiscal 2015 plans to separate our security and information management businesses 

the results of veritas are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and thus have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all reported periods furthermore veritas assets and liabilities were removed from our consolidated balance sheet upon consummation of its sale on january 29 2016 and have been classified as discontinued operations on our consolidated balance sheet as of april 3 2015 accordingly the following discussion reflects our current segment reporting structure which was reduced from three to two segments and segment results for all reported periods have been adjusted to conform to the current segment structure in addition the following discussion relates to our continuing operations unless stated otherwise 

our operating segments 

our operating segments are significant strategic business units that offer different products and services distinguished by customer needs the two reporting segments which are the same as our operating segments are 



for further description of our operating segments see note 8  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

financial results and trends 

the following  table provides an overview of key financial metrics for each of the last three fiscal years 

net revenues decreased 356 million  for fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations declines in our consumer security revenue and the impact of the additional week from the 53week fiscal 2015 year 

gross margin increased to 83  for fiscal 2016  compared to 82  for fiscal 2015  primarily driven by   decreases in  oem royalty fees and service related and content delivery expenses 

operating income increased 303 million  year over year as the reduction in our operating expenses was greater than the decline in our net revenues the lower operating expenses were primarily due to a decrease in corporate charges previously allocated to our information management business but not classified within discontinued operations these corporate charges were included in cost of revenues and expenses from continuing operations and include legal accounting real estate information technology services treasury human resources and other corporate infrastructure expenses unallocated corporate charges see note 8  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for more information on unallocated corporate charges we anticipate that we will not have unallocated corporate charges in fiscal 2017 and therefore our fiscal 2017 operating income will benefit from a reduction of unallocated corporate charges as compared to fiscal 2016 we expect our operating margins to fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including our operating results and the timing and amount of expenses incurred 

net cash provided by operating activities was 15 billion  for fiscal 2016  due to increases in deferred income taxes of 11 billion  and income taxes payable of 693 million  these amounts were partially offset by a loss from continuing operations net of income taxes of 821 million  including noncash items depreciation and amortization charges of 304 million  and stockbased compensation expense of 161 million  

total deferred revenue decreased from 29 billion  in fiscal 2015  to 26 billion  in fiscal 2016  primarily driven by a decline in sales and the amortization of retained contracts associated with veritas 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us requires us to make estimates including judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly historically our critical accounting policies and estimates have not differed materially from actual results however actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions if actual results differ from these estimates and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of operations and in certain situations could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 

we believe that the estimates described below represent our critical accounting policies and estimates as they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see also note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue primarily pursuant to the requirements under the authoritative guidance on software revenue recognition and any applicable amendments or modifications revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and require us to make estimates 

for software arrangements that include multiple elements including perpetual software licenses and maintenance or services packaged products with content updates and subscriptions we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on the fair value using vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue vsoe of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our standalone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance consumer product content updates managed security services subscriptions and arrangements where vsoe does not exist changes to the elements in a software arrangement the ability to identify vsoe for those elements the fair value of the respective elements and increasing flexibility in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount recognized in the current period and deferred over time 

for arrangements that include both software and nonsoftware elements we allocate revenue to the software deliverables as a group and nonsoftware deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vsoe ii thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” and iii best estimate of the selling price “esp” when we are unable to establish a selling price using vsoe or tpe we use esp to allocate the arrangement fees to the deliverables 

for our consumer products that include content updates we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the subscription upon sellthrough to endusers as the subscription period generally commences on the date of sale to the enduser we defer revenue and cost of revenue amounts for unsold product held by our distributors and resellers 

we expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate inventory of consumer packaged products to meet future customer demand which is generally four or six weeks of customer demand based on recent buying trends we ship product to our distributors and resellers at their request and based on valid purchase orders our distributors and resellers base the quantity of orders on their estimates to meet future customer demand which may exceed the expected level of a four or six week supply we offer limited rights of return if the inventory held by our distributors and resellers is below the expected level of a four or six week supply we estimate reserves for product returns as described below we typically offer liberal rights of return if inventory held by our distributors and resellers exceeds the expected level because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of excess inventory that will be returned we primarily offset deferred revenue against trade accounts receivable for the amount of revenue in excess of the expected inventory levels 

arrangements for maintenance subscriptions managed security services and saas offerings are generally offered to our customers over a specified period of time and we recognize the related revenue ratably over the maintenance subscription or service period 

reserves for product returns  we reserve for estimated product returns as an offset to revenue or deferred revenue based primarily on historical trends we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels as an offset to deferred revenue actual product returns may be different than what was estimated these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make actual results differ from our return estimates 

reserves for rebates  we estimate and record reserves for channel and enduser rebates as an offset to revenue or deferred revenue for consumer products that include content updates rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue or deferred revenue over the term of the subscription our estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and resellers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs which are typically entered into quarterly our reserves for enduser rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the promotional programs actual sales during the promotion the amount of actual redemptions received historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program and the value of the rebate we also consider current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserves for rebates if actual redemptions differ from our estimates material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented 

valuation of goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets 

business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill goodwill is allocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination the allocation of purchase price requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in determining the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets 

critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to future cash flows from customer relationships developed technology trade names and acquired patents and discount rates management estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

goodwill impairment  goodwill is allocated to our reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination based on the relative fair values at the acquisition date we evaluate our reporting units which are the same as our operating segments when changes in our operating structure occur and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually on the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired the accounting guidance gives us the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary the qualitative assessment considers events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount these include macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in the entity’s operating environment or industry or market considerations entityspecific events such as increasing costs declining financial performance or loss of key personnel or other events such as the sale of a reporting unit or a sustained decrease in the company’s stock price if it is determined as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount a quantitative test is performed in the first step of the quantitative testing we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount if the first step indicates that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount no further testing is required goodwill impairment tests require judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit to determine a reporting unit’s fair value we generally use the income approach which is based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit the estimation of future cash flows requires us to make projections of future revenues and expenses of each reporting unit and establish a weightedaverage cost of capital to discount these cash flows changes in these key assumptions and estimates or other assumptions used in this process could materially affect our impairment analysis in a given year for the fiscal year ended april 1 2016 we concluded that goodwill was not impaired as the results of our annual impairment test indicate that the fair values of our reporting units are significantly in excess of their carrying values 

longlived assets impairment  longlived assets including property and equipment intangible assets and equity investments excluding goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated from the assets are less than their carrying amount measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value our estimates of future cash flows require significant judgment based on historical and anticipated future operating results and are subject to many factors which are subject to variability and change 

contingencies and litigation 

we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on contingencies we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes from potential claims or proceedings as well as potential ranges of probable losses when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and reasonably estimable a determination of the amount of accrued liabilities required if any for these contingencies is made after the analysis of each separate matter because of uncertainties related to these matters we base our estimates on the information available at the time of our assessment as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims 

and litigation and may revise our estimates any revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our operating results and financial position 

income taxes 

we are required to compute our income taxes in each federal state and international jurisdiction in which we operate this process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes the income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as current or longterm deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of april 3 2015 and as longterm deferred tax assets and liabilities as of april 1 2016 following the adoption of accounting standards update no 201517 income taxes see note 1  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional information our judgments assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations  

our effective tax rate includes the impact of providing us taxes on certain undistributed foreign earnings attributable to the sale of veritas as well as the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding indefinitely reinvested earnings outside the us material changes in our estimates of such earnings or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of such earnings could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate if certain foreign earnings previously treated as indefinitely reinvested outside the us are repatriated the related us tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings 

we account for uncertain tax positions pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a twostep approach to recognize and measure those positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the refinement of estimates or the realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations  in the period in which such determination is made 

we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and based on this assessment establish a valuation allowance if required the determination of our valuation allowance involves assumptions judgments and estimates including forecasted earnings future taxable income and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations  

recently issued authoritative guidance 

see note 1  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for recently issued authoritative guidance including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on our results of operations and financial condition 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations  data as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal years indicated below 



the total percentages may not add due to rounding 

net revenues by fiscal year 

2016  compared to 2015 

net revenues decreased 356 million  year over year primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations of 171 million and declines in our consumer security revenue driven by the ongoing impact of changes to our renewal practices and a reduction in revenue from oem arrangements in addition net revenues decreased partially due to the impact of the additional week from the 53week fiscal 2015 year 

2015  compared to 2014 

 net revenues decreased 227 million  primarily due to declines in our consumer security products driven by our channel strategy to exit unprofitable retail arrangements and certain highcost oem arrangements coupled with the impact to change our renewal practices in addition net revenues decreased due to the general strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies and weakness in endpoint management partially offset by the impact of the additional week from the 53week fiscal 2015 year 

net revenues and operating income by segment by fiscal year 



2016  compared to 2015 

consumer security revenue decreased 217 million  primarily due to the ongoing impact of changes to our renewal practices and a reduction in revenue from oem arrangements unfavorable currency fluctuations of 81 million also contributed to the decline in revenue consumer security operating income decreased 58 million  primarily due to the decreases in revenue in this segment which were partially offset by reductions in cost of revenues sales and marketing and research and development expenses 

enterprise security revenue decreased 139 million  primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations of 90 million as well as decrease in sales of endpoint management and our mail cloud security products the decrease of 191 million  in operating income was primarily due to decreased revenue and increased allocation of stranded costs these stranded costs consist of overhead expenses resulting from the sale of veritas and primarily include information technology infrastructure and services and real estate costs 

2015  compared to 2014 

consumer security revenue decreased 176 million  primarily due to our channel strategy to exit unprofitable retail arrangements and certain highcost oem arrangements coupled with the impact of our decision to change our renewal practices consumer security operating income increased 54 million  primarily due to reductions in advertising and promotional expenses of 141 million and decreases in cost of revenues of 52 million and salaries and wages of 26 million partially offset by the revenue decline in the segment 

enterprise security revenue decreased 66 million  primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations as well as a decrease in the sales of endpoint management the decrease of 56 million  in operating income was mainly due to the reduction in revenue 

net revenues by geographic region by fiscal year 

fluctuations in the us dollar compared to foreign currencies unfavorably impacted our international revenue by approximately 171 million for fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  fiscal 2016  revenue for the emea and apj regions decreased primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations of 119 million and 49 million respectively compared to fiscal 2015  

fluctuations in the us dollar compared to foreign currencies unfavorably impacted our international revenue by approximately 92 million for fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  this was due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations of 53 million in the emea region and 39 million in the apj region 

our international sales are expected to continue to be a significant portion of our revenue as a result revenue is expected to continue to be affected by foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the us dollar we are unable to predict the extent to which revenue in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates if international sales become a greater portion of our total sales in the future changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenue and operating results 

cost of revenues by fiscal year 

2016  compared to 2015 

cost of revenues consists primarily of technical support costs costs of billable services and fees to oems under revenuesharing agreements our cost of revenues decreased 112 million  for fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  primarily due to favorable currency effects a decrease in oem royalty fees and a decrease in service related and content delivery expenses 

2015  compared to 2014 

our cost of revenues decreased 64 million  for fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  primarily due to favorable currency effects a decrease in oem royalty fees and a decrease in service related and content delivery expenses in our consumer security segment 

operating expenses by fiscal year 

2016  compared to 2015 

the overall decreases in operating expenses for fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  were primarily due to a decrease in unallocated corporate charges previously allocated to veritas these unallocated corporate charges are included in expenses from continuing operations refer to note 8  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for more information about our unallocated corporate charges the impacts of the unallocated corporate charges are discussed below in addition to the impacts of unallocated corporate charges we experienced favorable foreign currency effects on our operating expenses for fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  

sales and marketing expense decreased 358 million  primarily due to a reduction of unallocated corporate charges of 328 million 

research and development expense decreased 64 million  primarily due to a reduction of unallocated corporate charges of 76 million 

general and administrative expenses decreased 67 million  primarily due to a reduction of unallocated corporate charges of 91 million partially offset by an increase in stockbased compensation expense 

amortization of intangible assets decreased 30 million  primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2015  

restructuring separation and transition costs include severance facilities separation transition and other related costs for fiscal 2016 we incurred 44 million of restructuring costs 14 million in separation costs and 78 million in transition costs for further information on restructuring separation and transition costs see note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

2015  compared to 2014 

we experienced favorable foreign currency effects on our operating expenses in fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  

sales and marketing expense decreased 116 million  in fiscal 2015  primarily due to lower advertisement and promotions expenses partly offset by higher unallocated corporate charges of 67 million 

the 90 million  increase in research and development expense for fiscal 2015  was primarily due to higher unallocated corporate charges and stockbased compensation expense 

general and administrative expenses decreased 58 million  primarily due to a reduction of unallocated corporate charges of 17 million 

amortization of intangible assets decreased by 6 million  primarily as a result of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2015  

restructuring separation and transition costs include severance facilities separation transition and other related costs for fiscal 2015 we incurred 101 million of restructuring costs 23 million in separation costs and 40 million in transition costs for further information on restructuring and transition costs see note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

nonoperating expense net by fiscal year 





 percentage is not meaningful 

2016  compared to 2015 

nonoperating expense net increased 12 million  primarily due to net foreign currency remeasurement losses 

2015  compared to 2014 

nonoperating expense net increased 16 million  primarily due to a 32 million realized gain from sale of shortterm investments during fiscal 2014 offset by favorable foreign currency effects and a reduction in interest expense 

provision for income taxes by fiscal year 





 percentage is not meaningful 

we recorded an income tax expense on discontinued operations of 11 billion  223 million  and 242 million  for fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively see note 3  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional information 

tax expense in fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by 1 11 billion of tax expense for providing us taxes on certain undistributed foreign earnings primarily those attributable to the sale of veritas and 2 10 million of tax expense attributable to recording valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets 

the tax expense in fiscal 2015 was reduced by the following benefits 1 59 million for tax benefits related to the settlement of the symantec 2009 through 2013 internal revenue service “irs” audit 2 21 million in tax benefits resulting from tax settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations 3 14 million in tax benefits related to certain foreign operations and 4 14 million in tax benefits resulting from deductible separation costs 

the tax expense in fiscal 2014 was reduced by the following benefits 1 33 million for the resolution of a tax matter related to the sale of our 49 ownership interest in the joint venture with huawei during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 2 24 million for tax benefits related to the settlement of the symantec 2005 through 2008 irs audit 3 15 million tax benefit related to certain foreign operations and 4 13 million from lapses of statutes of limitation these tax benefits were partially offset by 12 million in tax expense resulting from the sale of shortterm investments 

the effective tax rates for all periods presented otherwise reflect the benefits of lowertaxed international earnings domestic manufacturing incentives and research and development credits partially offset by state income taxes 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and international tax jurisdictions a substantial portion of our international earnings were generated from subsidiaries organized in ireland and singapore our results of operations would be adversely affected to the extent that our geographical mix of income becomes more weighted toward jurisdictions with higher tax rates and would be favorably affected to the extent the relative geographic mix shifts to lower tax jurisdictions any change in our mix of earnings is dependent upon many factors and is therefore difficult to predict 

for further information on the impact of foreign earnings on our effective tax rate see note 11  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

see critical accounting policies and estimates above for additional information about our provision for income taxes 

in assessing the ability to realize our deferred tax assets we considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized we considered the following we have historical cumulative book income as measured by the current and prior two years we have strong consistent taxpaying history we have substantial us federal income tax carryback potential and we have substantial amounts of scheduled future reversals of taxable temporary differences from our deferred tax liabilities  levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in part i item 1a risk factors set forth in this annual report we have concluded that this positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence and thus that the deferred tax assets as of   april 1 2016  of 308 million  which are net of a valuation allowance of 50 million  are realizable on a “more likely than not” basis   

on september 3 2013 we settled and effectively settled matters with the irs for the symantec 2005 through 2008 fiscal years the result of the settlements effective settlements and remeasurements resulted in a reduction in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits in fiscal year  2014 of 122 million  

on march 18 2015 we settled and effectively settled matters with the irs for the symantec 2009 through 2013 fiscal years the settlement and effective settlement resulted in a benefit to tax expense in fiscal year 2015 of   59 million  additionally the company settled transfer price related matters of 158 million  a portion of which was accounted for against deferred tax liabilities on unremitted foreign earnings the company has paid in 155 million  to cover the final tax and interest liability on the settlement 

the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain and the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year although potential resolution of uncertain tax positions involve multiple tax periods and jurisdictions it is reasonably possible that the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to these audits could decrease whether by payment release or a combination of both in the next 12  months by 7 million  

we continue to monitor the progress of ongoing income tax controversies and the impact if any of the expected tolling of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions 

liquidity and capital resources 

divestiture of veritas 

in august 2015 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the assets of  veritas to carlyle and amended the terms in january 2016 based on the amended terms of the definitive agreement we received net consideration of 66 billion in cash excluding transaction costs and 40 million b common shares of veritas and veritas assumed certain liabilities in connection with the acquisition our us and foreign income taxes and indirect taxes payable resulting from the transaction are estimated to be 10 billion 

sources of cash 

we have historically relied on cash flow from operations borrowings under a credit facility issuances of debt and equity securities and sale of business more recently for our liquidity needs as of april 1 2016  we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 60 billion  and an unused credit facility of 10 billion  resulting in a liquidity position of approximately 70 billion  as of april 1 2016  49 billion  in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries we have provided us deferred taxes on a portion of our undistributed foreign earnings sufficient to address the incremental us tax that would be due if we needed such portion of these funds to support our operations in the us 

senior notes  in fiscal 2013 we issued 10 billion  of senior notes consisting of the 395 senior notes due in 2022 and the 275 senior notes due in 2017 we received proceeds of 996 million  net of an issuance discount in fiscal 2011 we issued 750 million  of senior notes consisting of the 420 senior notes due in 2020 

convertible senior notes  in fiscal 2016 we issued 500 million  in 250 convertible senior notes due april 2021  

revolving credit facility  in fiscal 2011 we entered into a 10 billion  senior unsecured revolving credit facility “credit facility” which was amended in fiscal 2013 the amendment extended the term of the credit facility to june 7 2017 this revolving credit facility was further amended in march 2016 to amend the definition of ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization to account for the sale of veritas and related expenses and to amend our consolidated leverage ratio under the agreement under the terms of this credit facility we must comply with certain financial and nonfinancial covenants including a covenant to maintain a specified ratio of debt to ebitda as of april 1 2016  we were in compliance with the required covenants and no  amounts were outstanding 

in may 2016 we replaced our existing 10 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a new 20 billion  credit facility see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report for more information 

we believe that our existing cash and investment balances our available revolving credit facility our ability to issue new debt instruments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements as well as to fund any cash dividends principal and interest payments on debt and repurchases of our stock for at least the next 12 months and foreseeable future in connection with the divestiture of veritas our board of directors committed to returning the net proceeds of the sale to stockholders through a combination of a special dividend and share repurchases the board of directors also resolved to adjust its annual dividend starting fiscal year 2017 to 030 per share to reflect reduced projected domestic cash flow following the sale of veritas while still enabling our company to invest in its future our strategy emphasizes organic growth through internal innovation and will be complemented by acquisitions that fit strategically and meet specific internal profitability hurdles 

uses of cash 

our principal cash requirements include working capital capital expenditures payments of principal and interest on debt and payments of taxes also we may from time to time engage in the open market purchase of our notes prior to their maturity furthermore our capital allocation strategy contemplates a quarterly cash dividend in addition we regularly evaluate our ability to repurchase stock pay debts and acquire other businesses 

stock repurchases on open market transactions  in fiscal 2016 we repurchased 17 million  shares or 368 million  of our common stock in fiscal 2015 we repurchased 21 million  shares or 500 million  of our common stock in fiscal 2014 we repurchased 21 million  shares or 500 million  of our common stock our active stock repurchase programs have 790 million  remaining authorized for future repurchase as of april 1 2016  with no expiration date 

accelerated stock repurchase in november and march of fiscal 2016 we entered into asr agreements with financial institutions to repurchase an aggregate of 15 billion of our common stock we made upfront payments of 500 million  and 1 billion  for a total of 15 billion  to the financial institutions pursuant to the asr agreements and received and retired the initial deliveries of 199 million and 424 million shares of our common stock the november 2015 asr agreements purchase period concluded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 whereby upon settlement we received an additional 50 million shares of our common stock the total shares received and retired under the terms of the november 2015 asr were 249 million  with an average price paid per share of 2008  the march 2016 purchase period is expected to close by or no later than the third quarter of fiscal 2017 the upfront payments for the november 2015 and march 2016 asr agreements are presented under the caption repurchases of common stock in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

dividend program during fiscal 2016  we declared and paid aggregate cash dividends of 30 billion or 460  per common share these dividends were comprised of our quarterly dividends and a special dividend of 400  per share during fiscal 2015  we declared and paid cash dividends of 413 million  or 060  per common share during fiscal 2014  we declared and paid cash dividends of 418 million  or 060  per common share our restricted stock and performancebased stock units have dividend equivalent rights entitling holders to dividend equivalents to be paid in the form of cash upon vesting for each share of the underlying units 

on may 12 2016  we declared a cash dividend of 0075  per share of common stock to be paid on june 22 2016  to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on june 8 2016  all shares of common stock issued and outstanding and unvested restricted stock and performancebased stock as of the record date will be entitled to the dividend and dividend equivalents respectively any future dividends and dividend equivalents will be subject to the approval of our board of directors   

restructuring plans   in fiscal 2015 we announced plans to separate our security and information management businesses in order to separate the businesses we put a restructuring plan in place to properly align personnel and have therefore incurred associated severance and facilities costs we also incurred separation costs in the form of advisory consulting and disentanglement expenses these actions were substantially completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 with the sale of veritas on january 29 2016  however we expect to incur immaterial adjustments to existing reserves in subsequent periods   

in may 2016 the board of directors approved a fiscal 2017 restructuring plan see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report for more information 

note repayment  in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 the principal balance of our 275 senior notes due september 15 2015  matured and was settled by a cash payment of 350 million  along with the 5 million semiannual interest payment 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes for the fiscal periods indicated selected items in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

continuing operating activities 

we expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including the timing of our billings and collections our operating results the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments 

net cash provided by operating activities was 15 billion  for fiscal 2016  due to increases in deferred income taxes of 11 billion  and income taxes payable of 693 million  these amounts were partially offset by a loss from continuing operations net of income taxes of 821 million  including noncash items depreciation and amortization charges of 304 million  and stockbased compensation expense of 161 million

net cash provided by operating activities was 108 million  for fiscal 2014  which resulted from net income from continuing operations of 91 million  adjusted for noncash items including depreciation and amortization charges of 374 million  and stockbased compensation expense of 105 million  these amounts were partially offset by decreases in income taxes payable of 240 million  deferred revenue of 161 million  and accrued compensation and benefits of 83 million  

continuing investing activities 

net cash provided by investing activities was 72 billion  for fiscal 2016  and was primarily due to net proceeds of 65 billion  from the divestiture of veritas and proceeds of 14 billion  from maturities and sales of shortterm investments partially offset by purchases of 378 million  of shortterm investments and payments of 272 million  for capital expenditures 

net cash used in investing activities was 11 billion  for fiscal 2015  and was primarily due to 18 billion  in purchases of shortterm investments and payments of 303 million  for capital expenditures partially offset by 10 billion  in proceeds from the sales and maturities of our shortterm investments

net cash used in financing activities was 800 million  for fiscal 2015  which was primarily due to the repurchases of our common stock of 500 million  and cash dividends paid of 413 million  partially offset by net proceeds from sales of common stock through employee stock benefit plans of 116 million

contractual obligations 

the following is a schedule by years of our significant contractual obligations as of april 1 2016  



  

 due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits as of april 1 2016  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities therefore 160 million  in longterm income taxes payable has been excluded from the contractual obligations table for further information see note 11  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

indemnifications   

in the ordinary course of business we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers vendors lessors business partners subsidiaries and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of agreements or representations and warranties made by us in addition our bylaws contain indemnification obligations to our directors officers employees and agents and we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers to give such directors and officers additional contractual assurances regarding the scope of the indemnification set forth in our bylaws and to provide additional procedural protections we maintain director and officer insurance which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers it is not possible to determine the aggregate maximum potential loss under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement such indemnification agreements might not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements and we have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our consolidated financial statements   

in connection with the sale of veritas we assigned several leases to veritas technologies llc or its related subsidiaries as a condition to consenting to the assignments certain lessors required us to agree to indemnify the lessor under the applicable lease with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of veritas technologies llc or its related subsidiaries breach of payment obligations under the terms of the lease as with our other indemnification obligations discussed above and in general it is not possible to determine the aggregate maximum potential loss under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement as with our other indemnification obligations such indemnification agreements might not be subject to maximum loss clauses and to date generally under our real estate obligations we have not incurred material costs as a result of such obligations under our leases and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations under our consolidated financial statements    

we provide limited product warranties and the majority of our software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging that our software infringes on the intellectual property rights of a third party historically payments made under these provisions have been immaterial we monitor the conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a loss has occurred 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies we do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

as of april 1 2016  we had 23 billion  in principal amount of fixedrate senior notes and convertible senior notes outstanding with a carrying amount of 22 billion  and a fair value of 23 billion  which fair value was based on level 2 inputs as of april 3 2015  we had 21 billion in principal amount of fixedrate senior notes outstanding with a carrying amount of 21 billion and a fair value of 22 billion which was based on level 2 inputs we have performed sensitivity analysis as of april 1 2016  and april 3 2015  by using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 50 bps movement in the levels of market interest rates with all other variables held constant on april 1 2016  and april 3 2015  a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixedrate senior notes and convertible senior notes by a decrease of approximately 41 million and 39 million respectively and an increase of approximately 42 million and 40 million respectively however this hypothetical change in market interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we conduct business in approximately 38 currencies through our worldwide operations and as such we are exposed to foreign currency risk our entities conduct their businesses in the primary local currency in which they operate however they may conduct business in other currencies to the extend our entities hold monetary assets or liabilities earn revenues or expend costs in currencies other than that entitys functional currency they will be exposed to foreign exchange gains or losses and impacts to margins as a result as part of our foreign currency risk mitigation strategy we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts with up to six months in duration to help mitigate foreign exchange risk however we are not able to mitigate all of our foreign exchange risk we have considered historical trends in exchange rates and determined that it is possible that adverse changes in exchange rates for any currency could be experienced the estimated impacts of a ten percent appreciation or depreciation of foreign currency are as follows 

we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of the changes in foreign exchange rates

acquisitions 

our strategy will be complemented by business combinations that fit strategically and meet specific profitability hurdles our acquisitions are designed to enhance the features and functionality of our existing products and extend our product leadership in core markets we consider timetomarket synergies with existing products and potential market share gains when evaluating the economics of acquisitions of technologies product lines or companies we may acquire or dispose of other technologies products and companies in the future 

we did not make any material acquisitions during fiscal 2015 

competition 

our markets are consolidating highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology the competitive landscape has changed significantly over the past few years with new competition arising much of the market growth has come from startups whose focus is on solving a specific customer issue or delivering a specific nicheoriented product and from larger integration providers that increasingly are looking to put various types of protection whether it is backup high availability or security into their platforms we are focused on delivering comprehensive customer solutions integrating across our broad product portfolio and partnering with other technology providers to differentiate ourselves from the competition we believe that the principal competitive factors necessary to be successful in our industry include product quality and effectiveness timetomarket price reputation financial stability breadth of product offerings customer support brand recognition and effective sales and marketing efforts 

in addition to the competition we face from direct competitors we face indirect or potential competition from retailers application providers operating system providers network equipment manufacturers and other oems who may provide various solutions and functions in their current and future products we also compete for access to retail distribution channels and for spending at the retail level and in corporate accounts in addition we compete with other software companies operating system providers network equipment manufacturers and other oems to acquire technologies products or companies and to publish software developed by third parties we also compete with other software companies in our effort to place our products on the computer equipment sold to consumers and enterprises by oems 

the competitive environments for our security and information management products are described below 

security 

most of the channels in which our security products are offered are highly competitive some of our consumer competitors are intensely focused on customer acquisition which has led competitors to offer their technology for free engage in aggressive marketing or enter into competitive partnerships our primary security competitors are intel corporation microsoft corporation “microsoft” and trend micro inc there are also several freeware providers and regional security companies 

that we compete against for our consumer backup offerings our primary competitors are carbonite inc and emc corporation “emc” in the ssl market our primary competitors are comodo group inc and godaddycom inc in the softwareasaservice “saas” security market our primary competitors are google inc and microsoft our primary competitors in the managed security services business are dell inc ibm corporation ibm and hewlettpackard company hp 

information management 

the markets for storage management backup archiving and ediscovery are intensely competitive our primary competitors are commvault systems inc emc hp and ibm 

intellectual property 

protective measures 

we regard some of the features of our internal operations software and documentation as proprietary and rely on copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures contractual arrangements and other measures to protect our proprietary information our intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that enables us to gain recognition for our products services and technology and enhance our competitive position 

as part of our confidentiality procedures we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with our employees distributors and corporate partners and we enter into license agreements with respect to our software documentation and other proprietary information these license agreements are generally nontransferable and have either a perpetual or subscription based time limited term we also educate our employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to protect our facilities equipment and networks 

trademarks patents copyrights and licenses 

symantec and the symantec logo are trademarks or registered trademarks in the us and other countries in addition to symantec and the symantec logo we have used registered or applied to register other specific trademarks and service marks to help distinguish our products technologies and services from those of our competitors in the us and foreign countries and jurisdictions we enforce our trademark service mark and trade name rights in the us and abroad the duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country and in the us we generally are able to maintain our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in use 

we have more than 2700 patents in addition to foreign patents and pending us and foreign patent applications which relate to various aspects of our products and technology the duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and for the us is typically 17 years from the date of issuance of the patent or 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application resulting in the patent which we believe is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products 

our products are protected under us and international copyright laws and laws related to the protection of intellectual property and proprietary information we take measures to label such products with the appropriate proprietary rights notices and we actively enforce such rights in the us and abroad however these measures may not provide sufficient protection and our intellectual property rights may be challenged in addition we license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our products and generally must rely on the third party to protect the licensed intellectual property rights while we believe that our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent trademark license or other intellectual property right 

seasonality 

as is typical for many large technology companies our business is seasonal license and maintenance orders are generally higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and lower in our first and second fiscal quarters a decline in license and maintenance orders is typical in the first quarter of our fiscal year as compared to license and maintenance orders in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year in addition we generally receive a higher volume of license and maintenance orders in the last month of a quarter with orders concentrated in the latter part of that month we believe that this seasonality primarily reflects customer spending patterns and budget cycles as well as the impact of compensation incentive plans for our sales personnel revenue generally reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than orders because revenue is not recognized until an order is shipped or services are performed and other revenue recognition criteria are met and because a significant portion of our inperiod revenue comes from our deferred revenue balance 

employees 

as of april 3 2015 we employed more than 19000 people worldwide approximately 44 of whom reside in the us approximately 6100 employees work in sales and marketing 6700 in research and development 4900 in support and services and 1900 in management manufacturing and administration

 item 1a risk factors 

a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below the list is not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock 

if we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited 

for the last few years we have experienced a number of transitions as we have attempted to revitalize our business model improve execution and innovate new products and services these transitions have involved significant turnover in management and other key personnel changes in our strategic direction and more recently our decision to separate into two independent publiclytraded companies transitions of the order we have experienced or are experiencing can be disruptive and result in loss of institutional focus and employee morale making execution of business strategies more difficult we are also in the process of seeking to address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the decline in the pc market the market shift towards tablets within mobility and architectural shifts in the provision of security and storage solutions all of which has made it more difficult for us to compete effectively and requires us to improve our product and service offerings we may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our efforts to address these challenges and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs in addition we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with these efforts given our multiple business units the proposed separation and the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate if we do not succeed in these efforts or if these efforts are more costly or timeconsuming than expected our business and results of operations may be adversely affected which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business 

we are pursuing a plan to separate our information management business into a new independent publiclytraded company the proposed separation may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or at all and if completed may not achieve the intended benefits 

in october 2014 we announced a plan to separate into two independent publiclytraded companies through a taxfree distribution to symantec stockholders of 100 of the capital stock of our information management business the “spinoff” we could be delayed or prevented from completing the proposed separation or be forced to complete it on terms or conditions that are less favorable andor different than expected for a variety of reasons including unanticipated developments such as delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances uncertainty of the financial markets furthermore any significant delays or complications in our implementation of a new enterprise resource management system and it infrastructure for our standalone information management business would adversely affect our ability to effect the separation in a timely manner and could result in significant business disruption increased costs or both in addition if other opportunities were to arise for the disposition of the information business that we believe are superior to the spinoff we may elect not to complete the spinoff even if the transaction is completed we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the proposed separation moreover following the proposed separation the combined value of the common stock of the two publiclytraded companies may not be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred in addition we expect to spend substantial time money and effort on completing the proposed separation without any assurance that it will be completed our investments in terms of financial and management resources may be significantly higher than expected which could limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities and distract us from operating our businesses as currently conducted our focus on completing the separation and resource constraints resulting from that focus could also adversely affect the execution of our business strategy 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees lose key personnel fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully or fail to manage  our employee base effectively we may be unable to develop new and enhanced products and services effectively manage or expand our business or increase our revenues 

our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key management technical sales marketing finance and other personnel our officers and other key personnel are employeesatwill and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them competition for people with the specific skills that we require is significant and we face difficulties in attracting 

retaining and motivating employees as a result these difficulties may increase during the pendency of the proposed separation and following its completion in order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace we believe that we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees in addition we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation plans and accounting rules require us to treat the issuance of equitybased compensation as compensation expense as a result we may decide to issue fewer equitybased incentives and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees or conversely if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution from time to time key personnel leave our company and the incidence of this increased in recent periods due to the transitions we have experienced over the last few years while we strive to reduce the negative impact of such changes the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and our results of operations in addition hiring training and successfully integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time consuming may cause additional disruptions to our operations and may be unsuccessful which could negatively impact future revenues these risks may be exacerbated by the uncertainty associated with the transitions we have experienced over the last few years including the proposed separation 

fluctuations in demand for our products and services are driven by many factors and a decrease in demand for our products could adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and services due to a variety of factors including general economic conditions competition product obsolescence technological change shifts in buying patterns financial difficulties and budget constraints of our current and potential customers awareness of security threats to it systems and other factors while such factors may in some periods increase product sales fluctuations in demand can also negatively impact our product sales if demand for our products and solutions declines whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in buying patterns our revenues and margins would likely be adversely affected 

if we are unable to develop new and enhanced products and services that achieve widespread market acceptance or if we are unable to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our existing products and services or adapt our business model to keep pace with industry trends our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our future success depends on our ability to respond to the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing or introducing new products product upgrades and services on a timely basis we have in the past incurred and will continue to incur significant research and development expenses as we strive to remain competitive additionally we are in the process of addressing the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the emergence of advanced persistent threats in the security space the decline in the pc market and the market shift towards tablets and handheld devices all of which have made it more difficult for us to compete effectively customers may require features and capabilities that our current solutions do not have our failure to develop solutions that satisfy customer preferences in a timely and costeffective manner may harm our ability to renew our subscriptions with existing customers and to create or increase demand for our solutions and may adversely impact our operating results new product development and introduction involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including 

 10 

 if we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges or if our new products product upgrades and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance our business and operating results could be adversely affected we may also experience increased difficulties in managing these risks and challenges during the pendency of the separation and following its completion 

we operate in a highly competitive environment and our competitors may gain market share in the markets for our products that could adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to decline 

we operate in intensely competitive markets that experience rapid technological developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements if we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a decline in our sales that could adversely affect our business and operating results to compete successfully we must maintain an innovative research and development effort to develop new products and services and enhance existing products and services effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors appropriately respond to competitive strategies and effectively adapt to technological changes and changes in the ways that our information is accessed used and stored within our enterprise and consumer markets if we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors or to changing technological and customer demands our competitive position and our financial results could be adversely affected 

our competitors include software vendors that offer software products that directly compete with our product offerings in addition to competing with these vendors directly for sales to endusers of our products we compete with them for the opportunity to have our products bundled with the product offerings of our strategic partners such as computer hardware oems and isps our competitors could gain market share from us if any of these strategic partners replace our products with the products of our competitors or if these partners more actively promote our competitors’ products than our products in addition software vendors who have bundled our products with theirs may choose to bundle their software with their own or other vendors’ software or may limit our access to standard product interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop products for their platform in the future further product development by these vendors could cause our software applications and services to become redundant which could significantly impact our sales and financial results 

we face growing competition from network equipment computer hardware manufacturers large operating system providers and other technology companies these firms are increasingly developing and incorporating into their products data protection and storage and server management software that competes at some levels with our product offerings our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our products 

security protection is also offered by some of our competitors at prices lower than our prices or in some cases is offered free of charge some companies offer the lowerpriced or free security products within their computer hardware or software products that we believe are inferior to our products and saas offerings our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive these security products as replacing the need for more effective full featured products and services such as those that we provide the expansion of these competitive trends could have a significant negative impact on our sales and financial results by causing among other things price reductions of our products reduced profitability and loss of market share 

many of our competitors have greater financial technical sales marketing or other resources than we do and consequently may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their products instead of ours further consolidation within our industry or other changes in the competitive environment such as intel corporation’s acquisition of mcafee could result in larger competitors that compete with us on several levels we also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the markets in which we compete 

if the separation together with certain related transactions is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our stockholders that are subject to us federal income tax andor the independent information management business could incur significant income tax liabilities 

receipt of opinions from outside tax counsel and from a national accounting firm together the “tax opinions” substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the proposed separation and certain related internal transactions collectively the separation will qualify under sections 355 and 368 of the internal revenue code the “code will be a condition to the completion of the separation in addition we will seek a private letter ruling from the irs to the effect that among other things certain aspects of the spinoff and certain other related transactions will not disqualify the spinoff or the related transactions from receiving the generally taxfree treatment that we are anticipating for us federal income tax purposes under the same code sections the tax opinions and private letter ruling will rely on certain facts assumptions 

representations and undertakings including those regarding the past and future conduct of certain of our businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the tax opinions and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the tax opinions and private letter ruling the irs could determine on audit that the separation and certain other related transactions are taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the tax opinions or for other reasons the tax opinions will not be binding on the irs or the courts accordingly the irs or the courts may challenge the conclusions stated in the tax opinions and such challenge could prevail 

if the separation is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we and those of our stockholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities for example if the spinoff fails to qualify for taxfree treatment the transactions would for us federal income tax purposes be treated as if the stock of the information management business was sold in a taxable sale for its fair market value and our stockholders who are subject to us federal income tax would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the stock received in the spinoff additionally the parties and their respective affiliates could incur significant us and foreign income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain related internal transactions undertaken in connection with the separation are taxable 

the parties might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances following the separation because of restrictions relating to us federal income tax requirements for taxfree distributions 

the parties ability to engage in significant equity transactions could be limited or restricted after the separation in order to preserve for us federal income tax purposes the taxfree nature of the separation and certain related internal transactions even if the separation otherwise qualifies for taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code it may result in corporatelevel taxable gain to symantec if 50 or more by vote or value of our shares or shares of the independent information management business are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the separation any acquisitions or issuances of the shares of either party within two years after the separation are generally presumed to be part of such a plan although the parties may be able to rebut that presumption 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to us of the separation the parties will agree not to take or fail to take any action that prevents the separation and related transactions from being taxfree among other restrictions these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions 

fluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected the price of our common stock in the past and could affect our stock price in the future 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts and investors our stock price could be negatively affected any volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance 

factors associated with our industry the operation of our business and the markets for our products may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate including 

 12 

 any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 

our business models present execution and competitive risks 

in recent years our saas offerings have become increasingly critical in our business our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying saas offerings for consumers and business customers pricing and delivery models are evolving devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own saas strategies we cannot assure you that our investments in and development of saas offerings will achieve the expected returns for us or that we will be able to compete successfully in the marketplace in addition to software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support saas offerings these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we are successful in this business model depends on our execution in a number of areas including 

 we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully 

the intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully any such changes may reduce margins and could adversely affect operating results additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud and saas delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact pricing in both our onpremise enterprise software business and our cloud business as well as overall demand for our onpremise software product and service offerings which could reduce our revenues and profitability our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings which could put pressure on us to further discount our product or support pricing 

any broadbased change to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products if we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand our revenues could decrease the increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing models 

our business depends  on customers renewing their arrangements for maintenance subscriptions managed security services and saas offerings 

a large portion of our revenue is derived from arrangements for maintenance subscriptions managed security services and saas offerings yet existing customers have no contractual obligation to purchase additional solutions after the initial subscription or contract period our customers’ renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the level of their satisfaction with our solutions or our customer support customer budgets and the pricing of our solutions compared with the solutions offered by our competitors any of which may cause our revenue to grow more slowly 

than expected if at all accordingly we must invest significant time and resources in providing ongoing value to our customers if these efforts fail or if our customers do not renew for other reasons or if they renew on terms less favorable to us our revenue may decline and our business will suffer 

our increasing focus on the delivery of products in an appliance form factor creates new business and financial risks 

since fiscal 2012 shipments of products to customers in an appliance form factor have represented an increasingly larger part of our revenues particularly in our information management segment and we expect this trend to continue the delivery of solutions in the form of appliances creates business and financial risks including the following 

 defects disruptions or risks related to the provision of our saas offerings could impair our ability to deliver our services and could expose us to liability damage our brand and reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business 

our saas offerings may contain errors or defects that users identify after they begin using them that could result in unanticipated service interruptions which could harm our reputation and our business since our customers use our saas offerings for missioncritical protection from threats to electronic information endpoint devices and computer networks any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems with our saas offerings could significantly harm our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses if that occurs customers could elect not to renew or delay or withhold payment to us we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation 

we currently serve our saasbased customers from hosting facilities located across the globe damage to or failure of any significant element of these hosting facilities could result in interruptions in our service which could harm our customers and expose us to liability interruptions or failures in our service delivery could cause customers to terminate their subscriptions with us could adversely affect our renewal rates and could harm our ability to attract new customers our business would also be harmed if our customers believe that our saas offerings are unreliable 

our saas offerings also involve the storage and transmission of large amounts of our customers’ proprietary information including sensitive and personally identifiable information breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business despite our precautions and significant ongoing investments to protect against such breaches our security measures could be breached at any time and could result in unauthorized third parties obtaining access to our or our customers’ data any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our saas offerings could reduce sales and constrain consumer and business customer adoption of our saas offering in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further security measures could be significant in addition prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in connection with adding storage capacity or upgrading our network architecture when required may cause our service quality to suffer problems with the reliability or security of our systems could harm our reputation 

we process store and use personal information and other data which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business 

we receive store and process personal information and other customer data there are numerous federal state local and foreign laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use processing disclosure and protection of personal information and other customer data the scope of which are changing and subject to differing interpretations we generally seek to comply with industry standards and are subject to the terms of our privacy policies and privacyrelated obligations to third parties we strive to comply with all applicable laws policies legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data 

protection to the extent possible however it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies our privacyrelated obligations to customers or other third parties our privacyrelated legal obligations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other customer data may result in governmental enforcement actions litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business our customers may also accidentally disclose their passwords or store them on a mobile device that is lost or stolen creating the perception that our systems are not secure against thirdparty access additionally if third parties that we work with such as vendors or developers violate applicable laws or our policies such violations may also put our customers’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business any significant change to applicable laws regulations or industry practices regarding the use or disclosure of our customers’ data or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of customers for the use and disclosure of such data is obtained could require us to modify our solutions and features possibly in a material manner and may limit our ability to develop new services and features that make use of the data that our customers voluntarily share with us 

if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to their customers our operating results could be adversely affected 

we sell our products to customers around the world through multitiered sales and distribution networks sales through these different channels involve distinct risks including the following 

direct sales  a significant portion of our revenues from enterprise products is derived from sales by our direct sales force to endusers special risks associated with direct sales include 

 indirect sales channels  a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels including distributors that sell our products to endusers and other resellers this channel involves a number of risks including 

 oem sales channels  a portion of our revenues is derived from sales through our oem partners that incorporate our products into or bundle our products with their products our reliance on this sales channel involves many risks including 

 15 

 if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels successfully these channels may conflict with one another or otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate which could reduce our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our competitive position some of our distribution partners have experienced financial difficulties in the past and if our partners suffer financial difficulties in the future because of general economic conditions or for other reasons these partners may delay paying their obligations to us and we may have reduced sales or increased bad debt expense that could adversely affect our operating results in addition reliance on multiple channels subjects us to events that could cause unpredictability in demand which could increase the risk that we may be unable to plan effectively for the future and could result in adverse operating results in future periods 

over the long term we intend to invest in research and development activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results 

while we continue to focus on managing our costs and expenses over the long term we also intend to invest significantly in research and development activities as we focus on organic growth through internal innovation in each of our business segments we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position we recognize the costs associated with these research and development investments earlier than the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or  businesses  and asset impairments 

in response to changes in industry and market conditions or in connection with our pending separation we may be required to strategically reallocate our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel reschedule or adjust with contract manufacturers and suppliers further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to evaluate goodwill impairment on an annual basis and between annual evaluations in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment evaluations may result in a charge to earnings 

our inability to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity event could impair our ability to deliver our products and services and harm our business 

we are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure to provide our products and services to our customers for example we host many of our products using thirdparty data center facilities and we do not control the operation of these facilities these facilities are vulnerable to damage interruption or performance problems from earthquakes hurricanes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they are also subject to breakins computer viruses sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in the delivery of our products and services 

furthermore our business administration human resources and finance services depend on the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations a disruption or failure of these systems or operations because of a disaster or other business continuity event could cause data to be lost or otherwise delay our ability to complete sales and provide the highest level of service to our customers in addition we could have difficulty producing accurate financial statements on a timely basis which could adversely affect the trading value of our stock although we endeavor to ensure there is redundancy in these systems and that they are regularly backedup there are no assurances that data recovery in the event of a disaster would be effective or occur in an efficient manner 

any errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our products and services could harm our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses for example we may experience disruptions outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors including infrastructure changes human or software errors capacity constraints due to an 

overwhelming number of users accessing our website simultaneous fraud or security attacks in some instances we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time interruptions in our products and services could impact our revenues or cause customers to cease doing business with us in addition our business would be harmed if any of events of this nature caused our customers and potential customers to believe our services are unreliable our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we could potentially lose customer data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario 

we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions which gives rise to risks and challenges that could adversely affect our future financial results 

we have in the past acquired and we expect to acquire in the future other businesses business units and technologies acquisitions can involve a number of special risks and challenges including 

 if integration of our acquired businesses is not successful we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects to integrate acquired businesses we must implement our technology systems in the acquired operations and integrate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations we also must effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired business organizations into our own in a way that aligns various interests and may need to enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions 

any of the foregoing and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from our acquired businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of acquisitions 

our international operations  involve risks that could increase our expenses adversely affect our operating results and require increased time and attention of our management 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the us and we have significant operations outside of the us including engineering sales customer support and production we plan to expand our international operations but such expansion is contingent upon our identification of growth opportunities our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations including 

 17 

 a significant portion of our transactions outside of the us is denominated in foreign currencies accordingly our revenues and expenses will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates for example in recent periods the us dollar has strengthened significantly against the euro and other major currencies which has adversely impacted our reported international revenue we expect to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future especially if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales or our operations outside the us continue to increase 

the level of corporate income tax from sales to our nonus customers is generally less than the level of tax from sales to our us customers this benefit is contingent upon existing tax regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits 

our products are complex and operate in a wide variety of environments systems applications and configurations which could result in errors or product failures 

because we offer very complex products undetected errors failures or bugs may occur especially when products are first introduced or when new versions are released our products are often installed and used in largescale computing environments with different operating systems system management software and equipment and networking configurations which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors failures or bugs in our products our customers’ computing environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and nonstandard configurations that make prerelease testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and timeconsuming in addition despite testing by us and others errors failures or bugs may not be found in new products or releases until after commencement of commercial shipments in the past we have discovered software errors failures and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and in some cases have experienced delayed or lost revenues as a result of these errors 

errors failures or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity damage to our brand product returns loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products loss of competitive position or claims by customers or others many of our enduser customers use our products in applications that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other less critical software products in addition if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity security or availability occurs in one of our enduser customer’s systems regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions delays or cessation of our product licensing which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating results 

if we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology our financial results could be harmed 

most of our software and underlying technology is proprietary we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws however all of these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties third parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise obtain use distribute and sell our proprietary information without authorization 

third parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently by designing around our patents our shrinkwrap license agreements are not signed by licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions furthermore the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the us and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries the unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could adversely affect our ability to access software operating system and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor or cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products to their customers in addition any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in could be costly may distract management from daytoday operations and may lead to additional claims against us which could adversely affect our operating results 

from time to time we are a party to lawsuits and investigations which typically require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses and which could if not determined favorably negatively impact our business financial condition results  of operations and cash flows 

we have been named as a party to lawsuits including patent litigation class actions and governmental claims and we may be named in additional litigation the expense of defending such litigation may be costly and divert management’s attention from the daytoday operations of our business which could adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows in addition an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could result in significant fines settlements monetary damages or injunctive relief that could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business results of operations and cash flows 

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

from time to time third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights including claims regarding patents copyrights and trademarks because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that the number of these claims may grow in addition former employers of our former current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers any such claim with or without merit could result in costly litigation and distract management from daytoday operations if we are not successful in defending such claims we could be required to stop selling delay shipments of or redesign our products pay monetary amounts as damages enter into royalty or licensing arrangements or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers we cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to investigate defend and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

in addition we license and use software from third parties in our business these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and may expose us to additional liability this liability or our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

adverse global economic events may harm our business operating results and financial condition 

adverse macroeconomic conditions could negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition under a number of different scenarios during challenging economic times and periods of high unemployment current or potential customers may delay or forgo decisions to license new products or additional instances of existing products upgrade their existing hardware or operating environments which upgrades are often a catalyst for new purchases of our software or purchase services customers may also have difficulties in obtaining the requisite thirdparty financing to complete the purchase of our products and services an adverse macroeconomic environment could also subject us to increased credit risk should customers be unable to pay us or delay paying us for previously purchased products and services accordingly reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase in addition weakness in the market for end users of our products could harm the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could then delay paying their obligations to us or experience other financial difficulties this would further increase our credit risk exposure and potentially cause delays in our recognition of revenue on sales to these customers 

in addition the onset or continuation of adverse economic conditions may make it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations investing activities including potential acquisitions or financing activities specific economic trends such as declines in the demand for pcs servers and other computing devices or softness in corporate information technology spending could have an even more direct and harmful impact on our business 

our  financial  condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liabilities 

as a result of the sale of our 275 senior notes “275 notes due 2015” and 420 senior notes “420 notes” in september 2010 and 275 senior notes “275 notes due 2017” and 395 senior notes “395 notes” in june 2012 we have notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of 21 billion that mature at specific dates in calendar years 2015 2017 2020 and 2022 in addition we have entered into a credit facility with a borrowing capacity of 1 billion from time to time in the future we may also incur indebtedness in addition to the amount available under our credit facility the maintenance of our debt levels could adversely affect our flexibility to take advantage of certain corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we may be required to use all or a substantial portion of our cash balance to repay these notes on maturity unless we can obtain new financing there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of 

refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase in addition changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest we pay on outstanding or future debt these risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our software products saas offerings and website may be subject to intentional disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future sales 

despite our precautions and significant ongoing investments to protect against security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and other intentional disruptions of our products and offerings we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance and availability of our products and offerings and harm our reputation as a company similarly experienced computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our website and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an event could adversely affect our competitive position reputation brand and future sales of our products and our customers may assert claims against us related to resulting losses of confidential or proprietary information furthermore our employees or contractors may either intentionally or unintentionally subject us to information security risks and incidents our business could be subject to significant disruption and we could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm in the event of such incidents 

some of our products  contain “open source” software and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business 

certain of our products are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under socalled “open source” licenses which may include by way of example the gnu general public license gnu lesser general public license the mozilla public license the bsd license and the apache license some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use by the terms of certain open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner in addition to risks related to license requirements usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third party commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software we have established processes to help alleviate these risks including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products in addition many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated and could if not properly addressed negatively affect our business 

if we are unable to adequately address increased customer demands on our technical support services our relationships with our customers and our financial results may be adversely affected 

we offer technical support services with many of our products we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers further customer demand for these services without corresponding revenues could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results 

we have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide consumer support functions to third party service providers if these companies experience financial difficulties do not maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level under these contracts the level of support services to our customers may be significantly disrupted which could materially harm our relationships with these customers 

we sell products to the us government under contracts that include special compliance obligations and subject us to audits and reviews by various agencies of  the  us government any failure to meet these obligations or an adverse outcome in an audit or investigation could result in civil damages andor penalties being assessed against us by the government 

we have sold products through our gsa schedule contract our gsa schedule contract contains provisions that require us to provide customers purchasing through that contract with negotiated favorable pricing as compared to certain nonfederal customers and requires us to monitor aspects of our commercial sales practices to ensure compliance with that pricing obligation in the ordinary course of business sales under our gsa schedule contract may be subject to audit or investigation by the us government noncompliance with the provisions of the contract identified as a result of such reviews as well as noncompliance identified on our own could subject us to damages and other penalties which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

on june 4 2012 we were advised by the commercial litigation branch of the department of justice’s civil division and the civil division of the us attorney’s office for the district of columbia that the government is investigating our compliance with certain provisions of our gsa schedule contract including provisions relating to pricing country of origin accessibility and the disclosure of commercial sales practices the department of justice has requested that we preserve among other things all records relating to gsa schedule contracting activity as reported on the gsa’s publiclyavailable database our total sales under the gsa schedule contract were approximately 222 million from the period beginning january 2007 and ending september 2012 in 2012 a sealed civil lawsuit was filed against symantec related to compliance with the gsa schedule contract and contracts with california florida and new york in july 2014 following expiration of the courtimposed seal the us government intervened in the lawsuit and in september 2014 the states of california and florida intervened in the lawsuit and the state of new york notified the court that it would not intervene in october 2014 the department of justice filed an amended complaint which did not state a specific damages amount and california and florida combined their claims with those of the department of justice and the relator on behalf of new york in an omnibus complaint the state claims also do not state specific damages amounts 

it is possible that the litigation could lead to claims or findings of violations of the false claims act and could be material to our results of operations and cash flows for any period violations of the false claims act could result in the imposition of damages including up to treble damages plus civil penalties in some cases whether or not we are successful in defending ourselves in the litigation the cost to resolve this matter would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition any negative publicity related to our government customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them regardless of the outcome of this matter may also damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts 

accounting charges may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results 

our financial results have been in the past and may continue to be in the future materially affected by noncash and other accounting charges including 

 our effective tax rate may increase which could increase our income tax expense and reduce increase our net income loss 

our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

 the price of our common stock could decline if our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate 

we report our results of operations based on our determination of the aggregate amount of taxes owed in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate from time to time we receive notices that a tax authority in a particular jurisdiction believes that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority we are regularly engaged in discussions and sometimes disputes with these tax authorities we are engaged in disputes of this nature at this time if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our stock price may be volatile in the future and you could lose the value of your investment 

the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future and as a result you could lose the value of your investment the market price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including 

 the stock market in general and the market prices of stocks of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price volatility that has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results 

unforeseen catastrophic or other global  events could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we are a global company and conduct our business inside and outside the us our business operations and financial results could be adversely impacted by unforeseen catastrophic or other global events including an epidemic or a pandemic acts of war or terrorist attacks cyberattacks natural disasters or political unrest or turmoil unforeseen political turmoil military escalations and armed conflict pose a risk of economic disruption in the countries in which they occur and in other countries which may increase our operating costs such incidences of uncertainty could disrupt customers’ spending on our products and services which may adversely affect our revenue in addition our corporate headquarters are located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known for seismic activity a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake could have a material adverse impact on our business operations target markets operating results and financial condition

the planned separation of information management from the security business 

on october 9 2014 we announced plans to separate our business into two independent publiclytraded companies one focused on security and one focused on information management the transaction is intended to take the form of a taxfree distribution to symantec shareholders of all of the capital stock of our information management business we expect to complete the legal separation on january 2 2016 subject to market regulatory and certain other conditions john gannon has been appointed as general manager of the information management business and don rath has been appointed as acting chief financial officer after the transaction michael brown and thomas seifert will continue to lead symantec as chief executive officer and chief financial officer respectively for additional separation cost information see   note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

our operating segments 

our operating segments are significant strategic business units that offer different products and services distinguished by customer needs in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 we modified our segment reporting structure to match our new operating structure the three reporting segments which are the same as our operating segments are 

  for further description of our operating segments see note 9  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

financial results and trends 

the following table provides an overview of key financial metrics for each of the last three fiscal years 



total net revenue decreased 168 million  for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 reflecting declines in our content subscription and maintenance revenue partially offset by an additional week from the 53week fiscal 2015 year and by increased license revenue content subscription and maintenance revenue decreased 211 million  primarily due to the general strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies and declines in our consumer security products driven by our channel strategy to exit certain highcost oem arrangements and change our renewal practices this was partially offset by increased revenue from backup and recovery products license revenue increased 43 million  primarily due to an increase in sales of our netbackup appliances partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

gross margin was 82  for fiscal 2015 compared to 83  for fiscal 2014 driven by growth in our lower margin appliance business 

operating income declined 34 million year over year as lower operating expenses largely offset lower net revenue our operating expenses decreased 138 million  year over year due to our cost savings initiatives and favorable foreign currency effects of 66 million fiscal 2015  operating expenses included 252 million  of restructuring separation and transition costs compared to 264 million in fiscal 2014 we expect our operating margins to fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including our operating results and the timing and amount of expenses incurred 

net cash provided by operating activities was 13 billion  for fiscal 2015 which resulted from net income of 878 million  adjusted for noncash items including depreciation and amortization charges of 443 million  and stockbased compensation expense of 195 million  these amounts were partially offset by decreases in deferred income taxes of 23 million  and income taxes payable of 191 million  

deferred revenue decreased 239 million year over year primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us requires us to make estimates including judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly historically our critical accounting policies and estimates have not differed materially from actual results however actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions if actual results differ from these estimates and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of income and in certain situations could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 

a critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially impact our operating results or financial condition we believe that the estimates described below represent our critical accounting policies and estimates as they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see also note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue primarily pursuant to the requirements under the authoritative guidance on software revenue recognition and any applicable amendments or modifications revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and require us to make estimates 

for software arrangements that include multiple elements including perpetual software licenses and maintenance or services packaged products with content updates and subscriptions we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on the fair value using vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue vsoe of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our standalone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance consumer product content updates managed security services subscriptions and arrangements where vsoe does not exist deferred revenue totaled approximately 37 billion  as of april 3 2015  of which 555 million  was classified as longterm deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets changes to the elements in a software arrangement the ability to identify vsoe for those elements the fair value of the respective elements and increasing flexibility in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount recognized in the current period and deferred over time 

for arrangements that include both software and nonsoftware elements we allocate revenue to the software deliverables as a group and nonsoftware deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vsoe ii thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” and iii best estimate of the selling price “esp” when we are unable to establish a selling price using vsoe or tpe we use esp to allocate the arrangement fees to the deliverables 

for our consumer products that include content updates we recognize revenue and the associated cost of revenue ratably over the term of the subscription upon sellthrough to endusers as the subscription period generally commences on the date of sale to the enduser we defer revenue and cost of revenue amounts for unsold product held by our distributors and resellers 

we expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate inventory of consumer packaged products to meet future customer demand which is generally four or six weeks of customer demand based on recent buying trends we ship product to our distributors and resellers at their request and based on valid purchase orders our distributors and resellers base the quantity of orders on their estimates to meet future customer demand which may exceed the expected level of a four or six week supply we offer limited rights of return if the inventory held by our distributors and resellers is below the expected level of a four or six week supply we estimate reserves for product returns as described below we typically offer liberal rights of return if inventory held by our distributors and resellers exceeds the expected level because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of excess inventory that will be returned we primarily offset deferred revenue against trade accounts receivable for the amount of revenue in excess of the expected inventory levels 

arrangements for maintenance subscriptions managed security services and saas offerings are generally offered to our customers over a specified period of time and we recognize the related revenue ratably over the maintenance subscription or service period 

reserves for product returns  we reserve for estimated product returns as an offset to revenue or deferred revenue based primarily on historical trends we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels as an offset to deferred revenue actual product returns may be different than what was estimated these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make actual results differ from our return estimates 

reserves for rebates  we estimate and record reserves for channel and enduser rebates as an offset to revenue or deferred revenue for consumer products that include content updates rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue or deferred revenue over the term of the subscription our estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and resellers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs which are typically entered into quarterly our reserves for enduser rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the promotional programs actual sales during the promotion the amount of actual redemptions received historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program and the value of the rebate we also consider current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserves for rebates if actual redemptions differ from our estimates material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented 

valuation of goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets 

business combination valuations  when we acquire businesses we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies and historical experience these estimates can include but are not limited to 

 these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and if such events occur we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities 

goodwill impairment  we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable at the reporting unit level our reporting units are the same as our operating segments a qualitative assessment is first made to determine whether it is necessary to perform quantitative testing this initial assessment includes among others consideration of i past current and projected future earnings and equity ii recent trends and market conditions and iii valuation metrics involving similar companies that are publiclytraded and acquisitions of similar companies if available if this initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that impairment exists a second step is taken involving a comparison between the estimated fair values of our reporting units with their respective carrying amounts including goodwill the methods for estimating reporting unit values include asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows and multiples of earnings or revenues if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and a third step is performed to measure the amount of impairment the third step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting units over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets less liabilities if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 

the process of estimating the fair value and carrying value of our reporting units’ equity requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis many assets and liabilities such as trade accounts receivable and property and equipment are not specifically allocated to an individual reporting unit and therefore we apply judgment to allocate the assets and liabilities and this allocation affects the carrying value of the respective reporting units similarly we use judgment to allocate goodwill to the reporting units based on relative fair values the use of relative fair values has been necessary for certain reporting units due to changes in our operating structure in prior years to determine a reporting unit’s fair value we use the income approach under which we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit we evaluate the reasonableness of this approach by comparing it with the market approach which involves a review of the 

carrying value of our assets relative to our market capitalization and to the valuation of publicly traded companies operating in the same or similar lines of business 

applying the income approach requires that we make a number of important estimates and assumptions we estimate the future cash flows of each reporting unit based on historical and forecasted revenue and operating costs this in turn involves further estimates such as estimates of future revenue and expense growth rates in addition we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation this discount rate is based on the estimated weightedaverage cost of capital for each reporting unit and may change from year to year changes in these key estimates and assumptions or in other assumptions used in this process could materially affect our impairment analysis for a given year 

as of april 3 2015  our goodwill balance was 58 billion  amongst our reporting units based on a qualitative impairment analysis performed as of january 3 2015 we determined that it was more likely than not that there was no impairment in any of our reporting units 

a number of factors many of which we have no ability to control could affect our financial condition operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed these factors include 

 intangible asset impairment  we assess the impairment of identifiable finitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset group’s carrying amount may not be recoverable recoverability of certain finitelived intangible assets particularly customer relationships and finitelived trade names would be measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset group to which the assets are assigned to the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows the asset group is expected to generate if an asset is considered to be impaired the amount of such impairment would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value recoverability and impairment of other finitelived intangible assets particularly developed technology and patents would be measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of undiscounted estimated future product revenues offset by estimated future costs to dispose of the product to which the asset relates for indefinitelived intangible assets we review impairment on an annual basis consistent with the timing of the annual evaluation for goodwill these assets generally include trade names and trademarks similar to goodwill impairment testing a qualitative assessment is first made to determine whether it is necessary to perform quantitative testing this initial assessment includes consideration of among other things i past current and projected future revenues ii recent trends and market conditions including discount rates and iii valuation metrics such as royalty rates involving similar companies that are publiclytraded if available if this initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that impairment exists a second step is taken this step involves a comparison between the fair values of the assets and their respective carrying amounts any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value would be recognized as an impairment charge our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted future revenue operating costs and other relevant factors assumptions and estimates about the remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are subjective and are affected by changes to our business strategies if management’s estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other assumptions the estimate of the fair value of our identifiable intangible assets could change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 

longlived assets  we assess longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the longlived assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment we assess recoverability of longlived assets based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method using assumptions determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model if an asset is not recoverable impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and its fair value our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors which could 

change and cause a material impact to our operating results or financial condition we record impairment charges on longlived assets held for sale when we determine that the carrying value of the longlived assets may not be recoverable in determining fair value we obtain and consider market value appraisal information from third parties 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation expense which principally consists of restricted stock units in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance stockbased compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is generally recognized ratably over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period of the respective award 

we record stockbased compensation expense for awards that are expected to vest as a result judgment is required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience actual forfeitures may differ if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted when we record an adjustment for the difference in the period that the awards vest or are forfeited 

contingencies and litigation 

we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on contingencies we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes from potential claims or proceedings as well as potential ranges of probable losses when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and reasonably estimable a determination of the amount of accrued liabilities required if any for these contingencies is made after the analysis of each separate matter because of uncertainties related to these matters we base our estimates on the information available at the time of our assessment as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates any revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our operating results and financial position 

income taxes 

we are required to compute our income taxes in each federal state and international jurisdiction in which we operate this process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes the income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as current or longterm deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets our judgments assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income 

our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding indefinitely reinvested earnings outside the us material changes in our estimates of such earnings or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of such earnings could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate if certain foreign earnings previously treated as indefinitely reinvested outside the us are repatriated the related us tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings 

we account for uncertain tax positions pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a twostep approach to recognize and measure those positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the refinement of estimates or the realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statements of income in the period in which such determination is made 

we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and based on this assessment establish a valuation allowance if required the determination of our valuation allowance involves assumptions judgments and estimates including forecasted earnings future taxable income and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our consolidated statements of income

results of operations 

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for the fiscal years indicated below 



the total percentages may not add due to rounding 

total net revenue by fiscal year 

2015 compared to 2014 

content subscription and maintenance revenue represented 88  89  and 87  of total net revenue for the fiscal years ended 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively content subscription and maintenance revenue decreased 211 million  primarily due to the general strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies and declines in our consumer security revenue driven by our channel strategy to exit unprofitable retail arrangements and certain highcost oem arrangements coupled with the impact of our decision to change our renewal practices this was partially offset by an additional week from the 53week fiscal 2015 year and by increased revenue from backup and recovery products license revenue increased 43 million  primarily due to an increase in sales of our netbackup appliances partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

2014 compared to 2013 

 content subscription and maintenance revenue decreased 61 million  primarily due to decreases from our consumer security  segment of 30 million and information management  segment of 26 million license revenue decreased 169 million  due to declines from our information management  segment of 89 million enterprise security  segment of 63 million and consumer security  segment of 17 million 

net revenue and operating income by segment by fiscal year 



2015 compared to 2014 

consumer security  revenue decreased 176 million  primarily due to our channel strategy to exit unprofitable retail arrangements and certain highcost oem arrangements coupled with the impact of our decision to change our renewal practices consumer security  operating income increased 54 million  primarily due to reductions in advertising and promotional expenses of 141 million and decreases in cost of revenue of 52 million and salaries and wages of 26 million partially offset by the revenue decline 

enterprise security  revenue decreased 37 million  primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations of 45 million the decrease of 27 million  in operating income was mainly due to the reduction in revenue 

information management  revenue increased 45 million  primarily due to growth in our netbackup software which was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations information management operating income decreased 85 million  driven by increased headcount related expenses including higher sales commission expense occupancy expenses and marketing spend partially offset by the increase in revenue 

2014 compared to 2013 

consumer security  revenue declined 46 million  primarily due to declines in pc tools revenue of 21 million and decreases in certain services activities revenues of 19 million consumer security  operating income increased 123 million  primarily due to lower advertising and promotional expenses of 128 million 

enterprise security  revenue declined 68 million  primarily due to a 54 million decline in endpoint management sales enterprise security operating income increased 101 million  mainly due to lower salaries and wages of 119 million lower outside services expenses of 28 million and a decrease in cost of revenue of 24 million partially offset by lower revenue 

information management  revenue decreased 116 million  primarily due to an 80 million decline in our storage management offerings a decrease of 50 million from our backup exec products and a decrease of 12 million from our enterprise vault products these decreases were partially offset by growth in our netbackup offerings of 31 million information management operating income decreased 113 million  primarily from decreases in revenue and higher materials costs related to our appliances business coupled with higher costs associated with our services business 

net revenue by geographic region by fiscal year 

fluctuations in the us dollar compared to foreign currencies unfavorably impacted our international revenue by approximately 156 million for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 fiscal 2015 revenue for the emea and asia pacific and japan regions decreased primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations of 100 million and 54 million respectively compared to fiscal 2014 

fluctuations in the us dollar compared to foreign currencies unfavorably impacted our international revenue by approximately 20 million for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 this was due to a 90 million unfavorable foreign currency fluctuation in the asia pacific and japan region partially offset by a favorable foreign currency fluctuation of 70 million in the emea region 

our international sales are expected to continue to be a significant portion of our revenue as a result revenue is expected to continue to be affected by foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the us dollar we are unable to predict the extent to which revenue in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates if international sales become a greater portion of our total sales in the future changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenue and operating results 

cost of revenue by fiscal year 

2015 compared to 2014 

cost of content subscription and maintenance consists primarily of technical support costs costs of billable services and fees to oems under revenuesharing agreements cost of license consists primarily of royalties paid to third parties under technology licensing agreements appliance manufacturing costs and other direct material costs intangible assets are primarily comprised of developed technologies and patents from acquired companies our total cost of revenue remained relatively consistent for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 cost of license increased in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to direct costs associated with our appliance offerings 

2014 compared to 2013 

our total cost of revenue remained relatively consistent for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 amortization of intangible assets decreased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 as certain developed technologies from acquired companies became fully amortized early in fiscal 2014 

operating expenses by fiscal year 

2015 compared to 2014 

sales and marketing expense decreased 116 million  primarily due to lower oem royalty fees of 130 million 

research and development expense increased 105 million  primarily due to higher salaries and wages of 34 million higher equipment costs of 12 million an increase in information technology and telecom costs of 11 million and an increase in stockbased compensation of 17 million 

general and administrative expenses decreased 67 million  primarily due to a reduction of outside services of 63 million 

amortization of intangible assets decreased 48 million  primarily as a result of various customer relationship intangibles becoming fully amortized at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2014 

restructuring separation and transition costs include severance facilities separation transition and other related costs for fiscal 2015 we incurred 125 million of restructuring costs 81 million in separation costs and  46 million  in transition costs for further information on restructuring separation and transition costs see note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

we experienced favorable foreign currency effects on our operating expenses of 66 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 

2014 compared to 2013 

sales and marketing expense decreased 350 million  in fiscal 2014 primarily due to lower salaries and wages of 188 million resulting from lower headcount and lower advertising and promotion expenses of 146 million our sales and marketing expense in fiscal 2014 was also impacted by the changes in our gotomarket strategy as described under part i item 1 business sales and gotomarketstrategy 

the 13 million  increase in research and development expense for fiscal 2014 was primarily due to higher equipment costs 

amortization of intangible assets decreased by 130 million  primarily as a result of various customer relationship intangibles becoming fully amortized at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2014 

restructuring and transition costs consist of severance facilities transition and other related costs associated with our organization simplification for fiscal 2014 we recognized 212 million of restructuring 49 million in transition costs related to our erp system and 3 million in other transition costs for further information on restructuring and transition costs see note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

we experienced favorable foreign currency effects on our operating expenses of 42 million in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 

nonoperating expense net by fiscal year 



2015 compared to 2014 

nonoperating expense net increased 29 million primarily due to a 32 million realized gain from sale of shortterm investments during fiscal 2014 that did not recur in fiscal 2015 

2014 compared to 2013 

nonoperating expense net decreased 73 million primarily due to a 32 million realized gain from sale of shortterm investments during fiscal 2014 coupled with a decrease in interest expense of 55 million as we experienced lower amortization of debt issuance costs and discounts following the maturity of our 10 billion 100 notes in june 2013 

provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate was approximately 20  22  and 25  in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

the tax expense in fiscal 2015 was reduced by the following benefits 1 59 million for tax benefits related to the settlement of the symantec 2009 through 2013 internal revenue service “irs” audit 2 21 million in tax benefits resulting from tax settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations 3 14 million in tax benefits related to certain foreign operations and 4 14 million in tax benefits resulting from deductible separation costs 

the tax expense in fiscal 2014 was reduced by the following benefits 1 33 million for the resolution of a tax matter related to the sale of our 49 ownership interest in the joint venture with huawei during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 2 24 million for tax benefits related to the settlement of the symantec 2005 through 2008 irs audit 3 15 million tax benefit related to certain foreign operations and 4 13 million from lapses of statutes of limitation these tax benefits were partially offset by 12 million in tax expense resulting from the sale of shortterm investments 

the tax expense in fiscal 2013 was reduced by the following benefits 1 17 million tax benefits arising from the veritas 2002 through 2005 irs appeals matters including adjustments to state liabilities and a reduction of interest accrued 2 13 million in tax benefits resulting from tax settlements and adjustments to prior year items 3 10 million from lapses of statutes of limitation and 4 2 million for the benefit of the research credit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 resulting from the extension of the federal research credit as part of the 2012 taxpayer relief act these tax benefits were offset by a 9 million tax expense from an increase in valuation allowance on state research tax credits 

the effective tax rates for all periods presented otherwise reflect the benefits of lowertaxed international earnings domestic manufacturing incentives and research and development credits of which the us federal research and development credit expired on december 31 2014 partially offset by state income taxes 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and international tax jurisdictions a substantial portion of our international earnings were generated from subsidiaries organized in ireland and singapore our results of operations would be adversely affected to the extent that our geographical mix of income becomes more weighted toward jurisdictions with higher tax rates and would be favorably affected to the extent the relative geographic mix shifts to lower tax jurisdictions any change in our mix of earnings is dependent upon many factors and is therefore difficult to predict 

for further information on the impact of foreign earnings on our effective tax rate see note 11  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

see critical accounting policies and estimates above for additional information about our provision for income taxes 

in assessing the ability to realize our deferred tax assets we considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized we considered the following we have historical cumulative book income as measured by the current and prior two years we have strong consistent taxpaying history we have substantial us federal income tax carryback potential and we have substantial amounts of scheduled future reversals of taxable temporary differences from our deferred tax liabilities  levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in part i item 1a risk factors set forth in this annual report we have concluded that this positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence and thus that the deferred tax assets as of   april 3 2015  of 350 million  which are net of a valuation allowance of 60 million  are realizable on a “more likely than not” basis   

in fiscal 2013 we resolved an irs audit for the veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years and executed the final closing agreement accordingly we recorded a further tax benefit of   3 million   in fiscal 2013 based on the closing agreement we also amended our state tax returns for the veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years in fiscal 2013 to reflect the adjustments in the closing agreement and remeasured our state liability resulting in a benefit of   7 million  

on september 3 2013 we settled and effectively settled matters with the irs for the symantec 2005 through 2008 fiscal years the result of the settlements effective settlements and remeasurements resulted in a reduction in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits in fiscal year   2014  of 122 million  

on march 18 2015 we settled and effectively settled matters with the irs for the symantec 2009 through 2013 fiscal years the settlement and effective settlement resulted in a benefit to tax expense in fiscal year 2015 of   59 million  additionally the company settled transfer price related matters of 158 million  a portion of which was accounted for against deferred tax liabilities on unremitted foreign earnings the company has paid in 155 million  to cover the final tax and interest liability on the settlement 

the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain and the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year although potential resolution of uncertain tax positions involve multiple tax periods and jurisdictions it is reasonably possible that the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to these audits could decrease whether by payment release or a combination of both in the next 12 months  by 44 million  

we continue to monitor the progress of ongoing income tax controversies and the impact if any of the expected tolling of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions 

liquidity and capital resources 

sources of cash 

we have historically relied on cash flow from operations borrowings under a credit facility and issuances of debt and equity securities for our liquidity needs as of april 3 2015  we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 39 billion  and an unused credit facility of 10 billion  resulting in a liquidity position of approximately 49 billion  as of april 3 2015  22 billion  in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries we have provided us deferred taxes on a portion of our undistributed foreign earnings sufficient to address the incremental us tax that would be due if we needed such portion of these funds to support our operations in the us 

senior notes  in fiscal 2013 we issued 10 billion  of senior notes consisting of the 395 senior notes due in 2022 and the 275 senior notes due in 2017 we received proceeds of 996 million  net of an issuance discount in fiscal 2011 we issued 11 billion  of senior notes consisting of the 420 senior notes due in 2020 and 275 senior notes due in 2015 

revolving credit facility  in fiscal 2011 we entered into a 10 billion  senior unsecured revolving credit facility “credit facility” which was amended in fiscal 2013 the amendment extended the term of the credit facility to june 7 2017 under the terms of this credit facility we must comply with certain financial and nonfinancial covenants including a covenant to maintain a specified ratio of debt to ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as of april 3 2015  we were in compliance with the required covenants and no  amounts were outstanding 

we believe that our existing cash and investment balances our available revolving credit facility our ability to issue new debt instruments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements as well as to fund any cash dividends principal and interest payments on debt and repurchases of our stock for at least the next 12 months and foreseeable future since the beginning of fiscal 2014 we have implemented a capital allocation strategy pursuant to which we expect to return over time approximately 50 of free cash flow to stockholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases while still enabling our company to invest in its future our strategy emphasizes organic growth through internal innovation and will be complemented by acquisitions that fit strategically and meet specific internal profitability hurdles 

uses of cash 

our principal cash requirements include working capital capital expenditures payments of principal and interest on debt and payments of taxes also we may from time to time engage in the open market purchase of our notes prior to their maturity furthermore our capital allocation strategy contemplates a quarterly cash dividend in addition we regularly evaluate our ability to repurchase stock pay debts and acquire other businesses 

stock repurchases  our board of directors authorized a new 10 billion  stock repurchase program during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 in fiscal 2015 we repurchased 21 million  shares or 500 million  of our common stock in fiscal 2014 we repurchased 21 million  shares or 500 million  of our common stock in fiscal 2013 we repurchased 49 million  shares or 826 million  of our common stock our active stock repurchase programs have 12 billion  remaining authorized for future repurchase as of april 3 2015  with no expiration date 

dividend program during fiscal 2015  we declared and paid aggregate cash dividends of 413 million  or 060  per common share during fiscal 2014  we declared and paid cash dividends of 418 million  or 060  per common share our restricted stock and performancebased stock units have dividend equivalent rights entitling holders to dividend equivalents to be paid in the form of cash upon vesting for each share of the underlying units no dividends or dividend equivalents were paid in any periods prior to fiscal 2014   

on may 14 2015  we declared a cash dividend of 015  per share of common stock to be paid on june 24 2015  to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on june 10 2015  all shares of common stock issued and outstanding and unvested restricted stock and performancebased stock as of the record date will be entitled to the dividend and dividend equivalents respectively any future dividends and dividend equivalents will be subject to the approval of our board of directors   

restructuring plans  in fiscal 2015 we announced plans to separate our business into two independent publiclytraded companies one focused on security and one focused on information management we expect to complete the legal separation on january 2 2016 subject to market regulatory and certain other conditions in order to separate the business we initiated a restructuring plan to properly align personnel and expect to incur associated severance and facilities costs we also expect to incur separation costs in the form of advisory consulting and disentanglement expenses these actions are expected to be completed in fiscal 2016 we expect to incur total severance and facilities costs between 165 million  and 195 million  we expect to incur separation costs between 170 million  and 190 million  excluding any potential tax implications outside the us and potential advisor fees payable upon separation total restructuring and separation costs are expected to be between 335 million  and 385 million  as of april 3 2015  liabilities for excess facility obligations at several locations around the world are expected to be paid throughout the respective lease terms as we continue to occupy these facilities the longest of which extends through fiscal 2019 

in fiscal 2013 we initiated a restructuring plan to reduce management and redundant personnel resulting in headcount reductions across the company as of april 3 2015  the related costs for severance and benefits are substantially complete however we expect to incur immaterial adjustments to existing reserves in subsequent periods 

note repayments  in fiscal 2014 the principal balance of our 100  convertible senior notes issued in fiscal 2007 matured and was settled by a cash payment of 10 billion  along with the 5 million  semiannual interest payment in addition we elected to pay the conversion value above par value in cash in the amount of 189 million  concurrently with the payment of the conversion value we received 189 million  from the note hedge we entered into at the time of issuance of the 100  notes in fiscal 2016 350 million of principal amount of 275 senior notes due september 2015 will mature and become due and payable 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes for the fiscal periods indicated selected items in our consolidated statements of cash flows

net cash provided by operating activities was 13 billion  for fiscal 2015 which resulted from net income of 878 million  adjusted for noncash items including depreciation and amortization charges of 443 million  and stockbased compensation expense of 195 million  these amounts were partially offset by decreases in income taxes payable of 191 million  and accounts payable of 65 million  

net cash provided by operating activities was 13 billion  for fiscal 2014 which resulted from net income of 898 million  adjusted for noncash items including depreciation and amortization charges of 498 million  and stockbased compensation expense of 156 million  these amounts were partially offset by decreases in deferred revenue of 223 million  

net cash provided by operating activities was 16 billion  for fiscal 2013 which resulted from net income of 755 million  adjusted for noncash items including depreciation and amortization charges of 698 million  and stockbased compensation expense of 164 million  and an increase in deferred revenue of 119 million  these amounts were partially offset by an increase in trade accounts receivable net of 107 million

in the ordinary course of business we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers vendors lessors business partners subsidiaries and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of agreements or representations and warranties made by us in addition our bylaws contain indemnification obligations to our directors officers employees and agents and we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers to give such directors and officers additional contractual assurances regarding the scope of the indemnification set forth in our bylaws and to provide additional procedural protections we maintain director and officer insurance which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers it is not possible to determine the aggregate maximum potential loss under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement such indemnification agreements might not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements and we have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our consolidated financial statements   

we provide limited product warranties and the majority of our software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging that our software infringes on the intellectual property rights of a third party historically payments made under these provisions have been immaterial we monitor the conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a loss has occurred 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies we do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

as of april 3 2015  and march 28 2014 we had 21 billion  in principal amount of fixedrate senior notes outstanding with a carrying amount of 21 billion  and a fair value of 22 billion  which fair value is based on level 2 inputs we have performed sensitivity analyses as of april 3 2015  and march 28 2014 by using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 50 bps movement in the levels of market interest rates with all other variables held constant on april 3 2015  and march 28 2014 a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixedrate senior notes by a decrease of approximately 39 million and 48 million respectively and an increase of approximately 40 million and 49 million respectively however this hypothetical change in market interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we conduct business in 43 currencies through our worldwide operations and as such we are exposed to foreign currency risk foreign currency risks are associated with our cash and cash equivalents investments receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies our exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses is the result of certain net receivables due from our foreign subsidiaries and customers being denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary primarily the euro and singapore dollar our foreign subsidiaries conduct their businesses in local currency we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts with up to six months in duration to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary we 

considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates for all currencies could be experienced the estimated impacts of a ten percent appreciation or depreciation of foreign currency are as follows 



we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of the changes in foreign exchange rates

overview 

symantec corporation protects the world’s information and is a global leader in security backup and availability solutions our market leading products and services protect people and information in any environment – from the smallest mobile device to the enterprise data center to cloudbased systems founded in april 1982 symantec operates one of the largest global threatintelligence networks and provides leading security backup and availability solutions the company has more than 20000 employees in more than 50 countries our internet home page is wwwsymanteccom other than the information expressly set forth in this annual report the information contained or referred to on our website is not part of this annual report 

strategy 

the recent transformation of business and consumer technologies has driven pervasive mobility and an explosion of data resulting in the need for a new approach to protecting devices applications data and users further the emergence of the internet of things where new devices and everyday objects are becoming networked and connected to the internet for the first time highlights the need for comprehensive information security and management solutions to protect valuable data we believe that the market for security and management solutions will benefit from these trends as a platformindependent software company without bias to any individual operating system or hardware environment symantec helps customers manage more technologies with greater efficiency and on a wide range of virtual and mobile platforms 

in january 2013 we announced our strategy to transition from being devicecentric or protecting endpoints and the data center to having a broader focus of protecting and managing digital information we track a vast number of threat indicators across the internet and continuously collect new telemetry from hundreds of millions of mobile devices endpoints and servers across the globe this massive amount of security data combined with our years of experience analyzing such data allows us to provide advanced intelligence and protection for all of our customers 

during fiscal year 2014 we implemented changes in three areas simplifying our organizational structure redesigning our gotomarket “gtm” strategy and changing our product offerings 

simplifying our organizational structure 

we aligned our organization by functional areas rather than by market segments in order to reduce complexity remove redundancies increase the speed of decision making and improve accountability and execution we reduced the number of management layers from our previous structure and increased the average span of control for managers 

redesigning our gotomarket strategy 

we split our direct field sales team into security and information management specialists focused on new business only and expanded their territories to be more effective for our enterprise customers we also built a renewals group in order to extend the customer relationship and make it easier to renew and do business with us we redesigned our global channel strategy focused on building partner competency rewarding performance and customer satisfaction 

 

changing our product offerings 

with a portfolio of leading products we focused our development efforts on making our point solutions better designing new integrated solutions and expanding our offerings by partnering with network security vendors to offer solutions that provide multitier protection 

business highlights 

during fiscal 2014 we took the following actions in support of our business 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

operating segments and products 

our current operating segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services distinguished by customer needs in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we modified our segment reporting structure to more readily match the new operating structure the three operating segments are user productivity  protection information security and information management 

user productivity  protection 

symantec’s user productivity  protection segment focuses on making it simple for customers to be productive and protected at home and at work these products include our norton solutions endpoint security and management encryption and mobile offerings

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for information regarding risks associated with our international operations see item 1a risk factors  

sales and gotomarket strategy 

in fiscal year 2014 we made changes to our gtm strategy reorganizing our direct sales force into specialist areas of security and information management focused on selling new business concurrently we created a dedicated renewals team that is focused on extending customer relationships and renewing our contracts we also streamlined our indirect sales strategy to have fewer more focused partners with specialized partner programs to enhance sales we believe these changes provide customers with a highquality sales and postsales support experience while also enabling us to expand our business 

our gtm network includes a direct sales force broad ecommerce capabilities and indirect sales resources that support our global partner ecosystem we also maintain important relationships with a number of original equipment manufacturers “oems” internet service providers “isps” and retail and online stores by which we market and sell our products 

we also made changes to our gtm marketing structure we created a new brand digital and advertising team focused on three gtm areas so that we can effectively market our different products and services distinguished by customer needs our three gtm focus areas are as follows consumer and small business commercial and enterprise 

our brand digital and advertising team develops marketing activation plans to increase awareness engagement consideration purchase retention and advocacy for our brands our brand efforts include digital marketing social media paid advertising ie search print digital search engine optimization brand partnerships crm video and other content production and other forms of demand generation and retention marketing we also invest in cooperative marketing campaigns with distributors resellers retailers oems and industry partners 

consumer and small business 

we sell our consumer products and services to individuals households and small businesses globally we bring these products to market through our ecommerce platform distributors direct marketers internetbased resellers system builders isps wireless carriers and retailers worldwide we also have partnerships with oems globally to distribute our internet security suites and our online backup offerings 

commercial 

we sell and market our products and related services to small medium and large enterprise customers through field sales and inside sales leveraging indirect sales partners around the world who are specifically trained and certified to sell our solutions these partners include national solution providers regional solution providers national account resellers globalfederal system integrators and managed service providers our products are also available on our ecommerce platform as well as through authorized distributors and oems who incorporate our technologies into their products bundle our products with their offerings or serve as authorized resellers of our products 

enterprise 

we sell and market our products and related services to the largest of enterprise organizations including government and public sector customers through our field sales force this field sales team is responsible for approximately 2000 named accounts around the world leveraging our global partner ecosystem primarily targeting senior executives and it department personnel responsible for managing a company’s highestorder it initiatives 

 

research and development 

symantec embraces a global research and development “rd” strategy to drive organic innovation engineers and researchers throughout the company pursue advanced projects to translate rd into customer solutions by creating new technologies and integrating our unique set of technology assets symantec focuses on short medium and longterm applied research develops new products in emerging areas participates in governmentfunded research projects drives industry standards and partners with universities to conduct research supporting symantec’s strategy 

symantec’s security technology and response organization is a global team of security engineers threat analysts and researchers that provides the underlying functionality content and support for many of our consumer small business and enterprise security products our security experts monitor malicious code reports collected through the global intelligence network to provide insight into emerging attacks malicious code activity phishing spam and other threats the team uses this vast amount of data and insights to develop new technologies and approaches such as symantec’s reputationbased security technology to protect customer information 

research and development expenses exclusive of inprocess research and development associated with acquisitions were 1038 million 1012 million and 969 million in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively representing approximately 16 of revenue in fiscal 2014 and 15 and 14 of revenue in fiscal 2013 and 2012 respectively we believe that technical leadership is essential to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to rd 

support 

symantec has support facilities throughout the world staffed by technical product experts knowledgeable in the operating environments in which our products are deployed our technical support experts assist customers with issue resolution and threat detection 

we provide consumers with various levels of support offerings consumers that subscribe to liveupdate receive automatic downloads of the latest virus definitions application bug fixes and patches for most of our consumer products our standard consumer support program provides selfhelp online services and phone chat and email support to consumers worldwide our norton one membership features elitelevel support which includes an under twominute wait time for phone calls an instant call back feature and virus protection assurance 

we provide customers various levels of enterprise support offerings our enterprise security support program offers annual maintenance support contracts including content upgrades and technical support our standard technical support includes selfservice options delivered by telephone or electronically during the contractedfor hours immediate patches for severe problems periodic software updates and access to our technical knowledge base and frequently asked questions 

customers 

in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 there were no customers that accounted for more than 10 of our total net revenue 

acquisitions 

our strategy will be complemented by business combinations that fit strategically and meet specific profitability hurdles our acquisitions are designed to enhance the features and functionality of our existing products and extend our product leadership in core markets we consider timetomarket synergies with existing products and potential market share gains when evaluating the economics of acquisitions of technologies product lines or companies we may acquire or dispose of other technologies products and companies in the future 

 

we did not make any material acquisitions during fiscal 2014 

competition 

our markets are consolidating highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology the competitive landscape has changed significantly over the past few years with new competition arising much of the market growth has come from startups whose focus is on solving a specific customer issue or delivering a specific nicheoriented product and from larger integration providers that increasingly are looking to put various types of protection whether it is backup high availability or security into their platforms we are focused on delivering comprehensive customer solutions integrating across our broad product portfolio and partnering with other technology providers to differentiate ourselves from the competition we believe that the principal competitive factors necessary to be successful in our industry include product quality and effectiveness timetomarket price reputation financial stability breadth of product offerings customer support brand recognition and effective sales and marketing efforts 

in addition to the competition we face from direct competitors we face indirect or potential competition from retailers application providers operating system providers network equipment manufacturers and other oems who may provide various solutions and functions in their current and future products we also compete for access to retail distribution channels and for spending at the retail level and in corporate accounts in addition we compete with other software companies operating system providers network equipment manufacturers and other oems to acquire technologies products or companies and to publish software developed by third parties we also compete with other software companies in our effort to place our products on the computer equipment sold to consumers and enterprises by oems 

the competitive environments for our security and management products are described below 

security 

most of the channels in which our security products are offered are highly competitive some of our consumer competitors are intensely focused on customer acquisition which has led competitors to offer their technology for free engage in aggressive marketing or enter into competitive partnerships our primary security competitors are mcafee inc owned by intel corporation microsoft corporation “microsoft” and trend micro inc there are also several freeware providers and regional security companies that we compete against for our consumer backup offerings our primary competitors are carbonite inc and mozy inc owned by emc corporation “emc” in the authentication services market our primary competitors are comodo group inc rsa the security division of emc entrust inc and godaddycom inc in the softwareasaservice “saas” security market our primary competitors are google inc’s postini services and microsoft our primary competitors in the managed services business are secureworks inc owned by dell inc and verizon communications inc 

information management 

the markets for storage management backup archiving and ediscovery are intensely competitive our primary competitors are commvault systems inc emc hewlettpackard company ibm oracle and veeam software 

intellectual property 

protective measures 

we regard some of the features of our internal operations software and documentation as proprietary and rely on copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures contractual arrangements and other measures to protect our proprietary information our intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that enables us to gain recognition for our products services and technology and enhance our competitive position 

 

as part of our confidentiality procedures we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with our employees distributors and corporate partners and we enter into license agreements with respect to our software documentation and other proprietary information these license agreements are generally nontransferable and have either a perpetual or subscription based time limited term we also educate our employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to protect our facilities equipment and networks 

trademarks patents copyrights and licenses 

symantec and the symantec logo are trademarks or registered trademarks in the us and other countries in addition to symantec and the symantec logo we have used registered or applied to register other specific trademarks and service marks to help distinguish our products technologies and services from those of our competitors in the us and foreign countries and jurisdictions we enforce our trademark service mark and trade name rights in the us and abroad the duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country and in the us we generally are able to maintain our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in use 

we have more than 2200 patents in addition to foreign patents and pending us and foreign patent applications which relate to various aspects of our products and technology the duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and for the us is typically 17 years from the date of issuance of the patent or 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application resulting in the patent which we believe is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products 

our products are protected under us and international copyright laws and laws related to the protection of intellectual property and proprietary information we take measures to label such products with the appropriate proprietary rights notices and we actively enforce such rights in the us and abroad however these measures may not provide sufficient protection and our intellectual property rights may be challenged in addition we license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our products and generally must rely on the third party to protect the licensed intellectual property rights while we believe that our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent trademark license or other intellectual property right 

seasonality 

as is typical for many large software companies our business is seasonal software license and maintenance orders are generally higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and lower in our first and second fiscal quarters a decline in license and maintenance orders is typical in the first quarter of our fiscal year as compared to license and maintenance orders in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year in addition we generally receive a higher volume of software license and maintenance orders in the last month of a quarter with orders concentrated in the latter part of that month we believe that this seasonality primarily reflects customer spending patterns and budget cycles as well as the impact of compensation incentive plans for our sales personnel revenue generally reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than orders because revenue is not recognized until an order is shipped or services are performed and other revenue recognition criteria are met and because a significant portion of our inperiod revenue comes from our deferred revenue balance 

employees 

as of march 28 2014 we employed more than 20800 people worldwide approximately 44 of whom reside in the us approximately 6600 employees work in sales and marketing 7000 in research and development 5400 in support and services and 1800 in management manufacturing and administration

 item 1a risk factors 

a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below the list is not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock 

if we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited 

in january 2013 under the direction of our thennew chief executive officer we commenced a plan to revitalize our business model with a focus on operations sales and organizational structure with the goal of improving our existing products and services at the same time we laid out a roadmap to develop new innovative products and services that solve important unmet or underserved needs one set of challenges relates to leadership under our new business model as in recent periods we have experienced transitions of several senior officers including our chief executive officer while our board of directors remains committed to our strategic direction management transitions can be disruptive and result in loss of institutional focus and employee morale making execution of business strategies more difficult we are also in the process of seeking to address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the decline in the pc market the market shift towards tablets within mobility and architectural shifts in the provision of security and storage solutions all of which has made it more difficult for us to compete effectively and requires us to improve our product and service offerings a third set of challenges relates to gtm execution as we have significantly reorganized our sales structure and have only recently announced our new product strategy we may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our efforts to address these challenges and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs in addition we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with these efforts given our multiple business units and the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate if we do not succeed in these efforts or if these efforts are more costly or timeconsuming than expected our business and results of operations may be adversely affected which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees lose key personnel fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully or fail to manage our employee base effectively we may be unable to develop new and enhanced products and services effectively manage or expand our business or increase our revenues 

our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key management technical sales marketing finance and other personnel our officers and other key personnel are employeesatwill and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them competition for people with the specific skills that we require is significant in order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace we believe that we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees in addition we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation plans and accounting rules require us to treat the issuance of equitybased compensation as compensation expense as a result we may decide to issue fewer equitybased incentives and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees or conversely if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

 

effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution from time to time key personnel leave our company and the incidence of this increased in recent periods following the transition within the office of the chief executive officer “ceo” in 2013 in addition we could experience similar departures following our recent chief executive officer transition while we strive to reduce the negative impact of such changes the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and the results of our operations in addition hiring training and successfully integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time consuming may cause additional disruptions to our operations and may be unsuccessful which could negatively impact future revenues these risks may be exacerbated by the uncertainty associated with the successive transitions in the office of the chief executive officer 

fluctuations in demand for our products and services are driven by many factors and a decrease in demand for our products could adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and services due to a variety of factors including general economic conditions competition product obsolescence technological change shifts in buying patterns financial difficulties and budget constraints of our current and potential customers levels of broadband usage awareness of security threats to it systems and other factors while such factors may in some periods increase product sales fluctuations in demand can also negatively impact our product sales if demand for our products and solutions declines whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in buying patterns our revenues and margins would likely be adversely affected 

if we are unable to develop new and enhanced products and services that achieve widespread market acceptance or if we are unable to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our existing products and services or adapt our business model to keep pace with industry trends our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our future success depends on our ability to respond to the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing or introducing new products product upgrades and services on a timely basis we have in the past incurred and will continue to incur significant research and development expenses as we strive to remain competitive new product development and introduction involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including 

 

         

if we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges or if our new products product upgrades and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

we operate in a highly competitive environment and our competitors may gain market share in the markets for our products that could adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to decline 

we operate in intensely competitive markets that experience rapid technological developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements if we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a decline in our sales that could adversely affect our business and operating results to compete successfully we must maintain an innovative research and development effort to develop new products and services and enhance existing products and services effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors appropriately respond to competitive strategies and effectively adapt to technological changes and changes in the ways that our information is accessed used and stored within our enterprise and consumer markets if we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors or to changing technological and customer demands our competitive position and our financial results could be adversely affected 

our competitors include software vendors that offer software products that directly compete with our product offerings in addition to competing with these vendors directly for sales to endusers of our products we compete with them for the opportunity to have our products bundled with the product offerings of our strategic partners such as computer hardware oems and isps our competitors could gain market share from us if any of these strategic partners replace our products with the products of our competitors or if these partners more actively promote our competitors’ products than our products in addition software vendors who have bundled our products with theirs may choose to bundle their software with their own or other vendors’ software or may limit our access to standard product interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop products for their platform in the future further product development by these vendors could cause our software applications and services to become redundant which could significantly impact our sales and financial results 

we face growing competition from network equipment computer hardware manufacturers large operating system providers and other technology companies these firms are increasingly developing and incorporating into their products data protection and storage and server management software that competes at some levels with our product offerings our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our products 

security protection is also offered by some of our competitors at prices lower than our prices or in some cases is offered free of charge some companies offer the lowerpriced or free security products within their computer hardware or software products that we believe are inferior to our products and saas offerings our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive these security products as replacing the need for more effective full featured products and services such as those that we provide the expansion of these competitive trends could have a significant negative impact on our sales and financial results by causing among other things price reductions of our products reduced profitability and loss of market share 

many of our competitors have greater financial technical sales marketing or other resources than we do and consequently may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their products instead of ours further consolidation within our industry or other changes in the competitive environment such as intel corporation’s acquisition of mcafee could result in larger competitors that compete with us on several levels we also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the markets in which we compete 

 

our business models present execution and competitive risks 

in recent years our saas offerings have become increasingly critical in our business our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying saas offerings for consumers and business customers pricing and delivery models are evolving devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own saas strategies we cannot assure you that our investments in and development of saas offerings will achieve the expected returns for us or that we will be able to compete successfully in the marketplace in addition to software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support saas offerings these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we are successful in this business model depends on our execution in a number of areas including 

 

  our business depends on customers renewing their arrangements for maintenance subscriptions managed security services and saas offerings 

a large portion of our revenue is derived from arrangements for maintenance subscriptions managed security services and saas offerings yet existing customers have no contractual obligation to purchase additional solutions after the initial subscription or contract period and given our limited operating history we are unable to accurately predict our customer renewal rates our customers’ renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the level of their satisfaction with our solutions or our customer support customer budgets and the pricing of our solutions compared with the solutions offered by our competitors any of which may cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected if at all accordingly we must invest significant time and resources in providing ongoing value to our customers if these efforts fail or if our customers do not renew for other reasons or if they renew on terms less favorable to us our revenue may decline and our business will suffer 

our increasing focus on the delivery of products in an appliance form factor creates new business and financial risks 

since fiscal 2012 shipments of products to customers in an appliance form factor have represented an increasingly larger part of our revenues and we expect this trend to continue the delivery of solutions in the form of appliances creates business and financial risks including the following 

 

         

defects disruptions or risks related to the provision of our saas offerings could impair our ability to deliver our services and could expose us to liability damage our brand and reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business 

our saas offerings may contain errors or defects that users identify after they begin using them that could result in unanticipated service interruptions which could harm our reputation and our business since our customers use our saas offerings for missioncritical protection from threats to electronic information endpoint devices and computer networks any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems with our saas offerings could significantly harm our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses if that occurs customers could elect not to renew or delay or withhold payment to us we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation 

we currently serve our saasbased customers from hosting facilities located across the globe damage to or failure of any significant element of these hosting facilities could result in interruptions in our service which could harm our customers and expose us to liability interruptions or failures in our service delivery could cause customers to terminate their subscriptions with us could adversely affect our renewal rates and could harm our ability to attract new customers our business would also be harmed if our customers believe that our saas offerings are unreliable 

our saas offerings also involve the storage and transmission of large amounts of our customers’ proprietary information including sensitive and personally identifiable information breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business despite our precautions and significant ongoing investments to protect against such breaches our security measures could be breached at any time and could result in unauthorized third parties obtaining access to our or our customers’ data any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our saas offerings could reduce sales and constrain consumer and business customer adoption of our saas offering in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further security measures could be significant 

if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to their customers our operating results could be adversely affected 

we sell our products to customers around the world through multitiered sales and distribution networks sales through these different channels involve distinct risks including the following 

direct sales  a significant portion of our revenues from enterprise products is derived from sales by our direct sales force to endusers special risks associated with direct sales include 

 

    

indirect sales channels  a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels including distributors that sell our products to endusers and other resellers this channel involves a number of risks including 

 

     oem sales channels  a portion of our revenues is derived from sales through our oem partners that incorporate our products into or bundle our products with their products our reliance on this sales channel involves many risks including 

 

       if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels successfully these channels may conflict with one another or otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate which could reduce our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our competitive position some of our distribution partners have experienced financial difficulties in the past and if our partners suffer financial difficulties in the future because of general economic conditions or for other reasons these partners may delay paying their obligations to us and we may have reduced sales or increased bad debt expense that could adversely affect our operating results in addition reliance on multiple channels subjects us to events that could cause unpredictability in demand which could increase the risk that we may be unable to plan effectively for the future and could result in adverse operating results in future periods 

over the long term we intend to invest in research and development activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results 

while we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses over the long term we also intend to invest in research and development activities as we focus on organic growth through internal innovation we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

 

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairments 

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically reallocate our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel reschedule or adjust with contract manufacturers and suppliers further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to evaluate goodwill impairment on an annual basis and between annual evaluations in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment evaluations may result in a charge to earnings 

our inability to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity event could impair our ability to deliver our products and services and harm our business 

we are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure to provide our products and services to our customers for example we host many of our products using thirdparty data center facilities and we do not control the operation of these facilities these facilities are vulnerable to damage interruption or performance problems from earthquakes hurricanes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures and similar events they are also subject to breakins computer viruses sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in the delivery of our products and services 

furthermore our business administration human resources and finance services depend on the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations a disruption or failure of these systems or operations because of a disaster or other business continuity event could cause data to be lost or otherwise delay our ability to complete sales and provide the highest level of service to our customers in addition we could have difficulty producing accurate financial statements on a timely basis which could affect the trading value of our stock although we endeavor to ensure there is redundancy in these systems and that they are regularly backedup there are no assurances that data recovery in the event of a disaster would be effective or occur in an efficient manner 

any errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our products and services could harm our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses for example we may experience disruptions outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors including infrastructure changes human or software errors capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our website simultaneous fraud or security attacks in some instances we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time interruptions in our products and services could impact our revenues or cause customers to cease doing business with us in addition our business would be harmed if any of events of this nature caused our customers and potential customers to believe our services are unreliable our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we could potentially lose customer data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario 

 

we are currently planning and designing information systems enhancements and problems with the design or implementation of these enhancements could interfere with our business and operations 

we are currently in the process of significantly enhancing our information systems including planning and designing a new enterprise resource planning system the implementation of significant enhancements to information systems is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise which may especially be the case for us due to the size and complexity of our businesses any disruptions relating to our systems enhancements particularly any disruptions impacting our operations during the design or implementation periods could adversely affect our ability to process customer orders ship products provide services and support to our customers bill and track our customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business even if we do not encounter these adverse effects the planning designing and implementation may be much more costly than we anticipated if we are unable to successfully plan design or implement the information systems enhancements as planned our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted 

we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions which gives rise to risks and challenges that could adversely affect our future financial results 

we have in the past acquired and we expect to acquire in the future other businesses business units and technologies acquisitions can involve a number of special risks and challenges including 

 

       if integration of our acquired businesses is not successful we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects to integrate acquired businesses we must implement our technology systems in the acquired operations and integrate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations we also must effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired business organizations into our own in a way that aligns various interests and may need to enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions 

any of the foregoing and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from our acquired businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of acquisitions 

our international operations involve risks that could increase our expenses adversely affect our operating results and require increased time and attention of our management 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the us and we have significant operations outside of the us including engineering sales customer support and production we plan to expand our international operations but such expansion is contingent upon our identification of growth opportunities our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations including 

 

  

            a significant portion of our transactions outside of the us are denominated in foreign currencies accordingly our revenues and expenses will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates we expect to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future especially if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales or our operations outside the united states continue to increase 

the level of corporate tax from sales to our nonus customers is generally less than the level of tax from sales to our us customers this benefit is contingent upon existing tax regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits 

our products are complex and operate in a wide variety of environments systems applications and configurations which could result in errors or product failures 

because we offer very complex products undetected errors failures or bugs may occur especially when products are first introduced or when new versions are released our products are often installed and used in largescale computing environments with different operating systems system management software and equipment and networking configurations which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors failures or bugs in our products our customers’ computing environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and nonstandard configurations that make prerelease testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and timeconsuming in addition despite testing by us and others errors failures or bugs may not be found in new products or releases until after commencement of commercial shipments in the past we have discovered software errors failures and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and in some cases have experienced delayed or lost revenues as a result of these errors 

errors failures or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity damage to our brand product returns loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products loss of competitive position or claims by 

 

customers or others many of our enduser customers use our products in applications that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other less critical software products in addition if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity or availability occurs in one of our enduser customer’s systems regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions delays or cessation of our product licensing which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating results 

if we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology our financial results could be harmed 

most of our software and underlying technology is proprietary we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws however all of these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties third parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise obtain use distribute and sell our proprietary information without authorization 

third parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently by designing around our patents our shrinkwrap license agreements are not signed by licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions furthermore the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the us and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries the unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could adversely affect our ability to access software operating system and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor or cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products to their customers in addition any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in alone or through our alliances with the business software alliance “bsa” or the software  information industry association “siia” could be costly may distract management from daytoday operations and may lead to additional claims against us which could adversely affect our operating results 

from time to time we are a party to class action and other lawsuits and investigations which typically require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses and which could if not determined favorably negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have been named as a party to class action lawsuits and we may be named in additional litigation for example during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 we were advised by the commercial litigation branch of the department of justice’s civil division and the civil division of the us attorney’s office for the district of columbia that the government is investigating our compliance with certain provisions of our us general services administration multiple award schedule contract no gs35f0240t effective january 24 2007 including provisions relating to pricing country of origin accessibility and the disclosure of commercial sales practices the expense of defending such litigation may be costly and divert management’s attention from the daytoday operations of our business which could adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows in addition an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could result in significant fines settlements monetary damages or injunctive relief that could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business results of operations and cash flows 

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

from time to time we receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others including claims regarding patents copyrights and trademarks because of constant technological change in the segments 

 

in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that the number of these claims may grow in addition former employers of our former current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers any such claim with or without merit could result in costly litigation and distract management from daytoday operations if we are not successful in defending such claims we could be required to stop selling delay shipments of or redesign our products pay monetary amounts as damages enter into royalty or licensing arrangements or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers we cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to investigate defend and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

in addition we license and use software from third parties in our business these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and may expose us to additional liability this liability or our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

fluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected the price of our common stock in the past and could affect our stock price in the future 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and which could adversely affect our operations and operating results if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts and investors our stock price could be negatively affected any volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance 

factors associated with our industry the operation of our business and the markets for our products may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate including 

 

                  

    any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 

adverse global economic events may harm our business operating results and financial condition 

adverse macroeconomic conditions could negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition under a number of different scenarios during challenging economic times and periods of high unemployment current or potential customers may delay or forgo decisions to license new products or additional instances of existing products upgrade their existing hardware or operating environments which upgrades are often a catalyst for new purchases of our software or purchase services customers may also have difficulties in obtaining the requisite thirdparty financing to complete the purchase of our products and services an adverse macroeconomic environment could also subject us to increased credit risk should customers be unable to pay us or delay paying us for previously purchased products and services accordingly reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase in addition weakness in the market for end users of our products could harm the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could then delay paying their obligations to us or experience other financial difficulties this would further increase our credit risk exposure and potentially cause delays in our recognition of revenue on sales to these customers 

in addition the onset or continuation of adverse economic conditions may make it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations investing activities including potential acquisitions or financing activities specific economic trends such as declines in the demand for pcs servers and other computing devices or softness in corporate information technology spending could have an even more direct and harmful impact on our business 

our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liabilities 

as a result of the sale of our 275 senior notes “275 notes due 2015” and 420 senior notes “420 notes” in september 2010 and 275 senior notes “275 notes due 2017” and 395 senior notes “395 notes” in june 2012 we have notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of 21 billion that mature at specific dates in calendar years 2015 2017 2020 and 2022 in addition we have entered into a credit facility with a borrowing capacity of 1 billion from time to time in the future we may also incur indebtedness in addition to the amount available under our credit facility the maintenance of our debt levels could adversely affect our flexibility to take advantage of certain corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may be required to use all or a substantial portion of our cash balance to repay these notes on maturity unless we can obtain new financing 

our software products saas offerings and website may be subject to intentional disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future sales 

despite our precautions and significant ongoing investments to protect against security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and other intentional disruptions of our products and offerings we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance of our products and offerings and harm our reputation as a company similarly experienced computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our website and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks 

 

change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an event could adversely affect our competitive position reputation brand and future sales of our products and our customers may assert claims against us related to resulting losses of confidential or proprietary information our business could be subject to significant disruption and we could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm in the event of such incidents and claims 

some of our products contain “open source” software and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business 

certain of our products are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under socalled “open source” licenses which may include by way of example the gnu general public license gnu lesser general public license the mozilla public license the bsd license and the apache license some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use by the terms of certain open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner in addition to risks related to license requirements usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third party commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software we have established processes to help alleviate these risks including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products in addition many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated and could if not properly addressed negatively affect our business 

if we are unable to adequately address increased customer demands on our technical support services our relationships with our customers and our financial results may be adversely affected 

we offer technical support services with many of our products we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers further customer demand for these services without corresponding revenues could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results 

we have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide consumer support functions to third party service providers if these companies experience financial difficulties do not maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level under these contracts the level of support services to our customers may be significantly disrupted which could materially harm our relationships with these customers 

we sell products to the us government under contracts that include special compliance obligations and subject us to audits and reviews by various agencies of the us government any failure to meet these obligations or an adverse outcome in an audit or investigation could result in civil damages andor penalties being assessed against us by the government 

we have sold products through our gsa schedule contract our gsa schedule contract contains provisions that require us to provide customers purchasing through that contract with negotiated favorable pricing as compared to certain nonfederal customers and requires us to monitor aspects of our commercial sales practices to ensure compliance with that pricing obligation in the ordinary course of business sales under our gsa schedule contract may be subject to audit or investigation by the us government noncompliance with the provisions of the contract identified as a result of such reviews as well as noncompliance identified on our own could subject us to damages and other penalties which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

 

on june 4 2012 we were advised by the commercial litigation branch of the department of justice’s civil division and the civil division of the us attorney’s office for the district of columbia that the government is investigating our compliance with certain provisions of our gsa schedule contract including provisions relating to pricing country of origin accessibility and the disclosure of commercial sales practices the department of justice has requested that we preserve among other things all records relating to gsa schedule contracting activity as reported on the gsa’s publiclyavailable database our total sales under the gsa schedule contract were approximately 222 million from the period beginning january 2007 and ending september 2012 

we are cooperating with the investigation and we are unable at this time to predict the likely outcome it is possible that the investigation could lead to claims or findings of violations of the false claims act in connection with our gsa contracting activity violations of the false claims act could result in the imposition of damages including up to treble damages plus civil penalties in some cases to the extent the investigation leads to any such claims or findings the cost to resolve this matter would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition any negative publicity related to our government customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them regardless of the outcome of this matter may also damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts 

accounting charges may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results 

our financial results have been in the past and may continue to be in the future materially affected by noncash and other accounting charges including 

 

     our effective tax rate may increase which could increase our income tax expense and reduce increase our net income loss 

our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

 

    the price of our common stock could decline if our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate 

we report our results of operations based on our determination of the aggregate amount of taxes owed in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate from time to time we receive notices that a tax authority in a particular jurisdiction believes that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority we are regularly engaged in discussions and sometimes disputes with these tax authorities we are engaged in disputes of this nature at this time if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an 

 

amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our stock price may be volatile in the future and you could lose the value of your investment 

the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future and as a result you could lose the value of your investment the market price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including 

 

           the stock market in general and the market prices of stocks of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price volatility that has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results 

unforeseen catastrophic or other global events could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we are a global company and conduct our business inside and outside the united states our business operations and financial results could be adversely impacted by unforeseen catastrophic or other global events including an epidemic or a pandemic acts of war or terrorist attacks cyberattacks natural disasters or political unrest or turmoil unforeseen political turmoil military escalations and armed conflict pose a risk of economic disruption in the countries in which they occur and in other countries which may increase our operating costs such incidences of uncertainty could disrupt customers’ spending on our products and services which may adversely affect our revenue in addition our corporate headquarters are located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known for seismic activity a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake could have a material adverse impact on our business operations target markets operating results and financial condition

strategy 

the recent transformation of business and consumer technologies has driven pervasive mobility and an explosion of data resulting in the need for a new approach to protecting devices applications data and users further the emergence of the internet of things where new devices and everyday objects are becoming networked and connected to the internet for the first time highlights the need for comprehensive information security and management solutions to protect valuable data we believe that the market for security and management solutions will benefit from these trends as a platformindependent software company without bias to any individual operating system or hardware environment symantec helps customers manage more technologies with greater efficiency and on a wide range of virtual and mobile platforms 

in january 2013 we announced our strategy to transition from being devicecentric or protecting endpoints and the data center to having a broader focus of protecting and managing digital information we track a vast number of threat indicators across the internet and continuously collect new telemetry from hundreds of millions of mobile devices endpoints and servers across the globe this massive amount of security data combined with our years of experience analyzing such data allows us to provide advanced intelligence and protection for all of our customers 

during fiscal year 2014 we implemented changes in three areas simplifying our organizational structure redesigning our gtm strategy and changing our product offerings 

simplifying our organizational structure 

we aligned our organization by functional areas rather than by market segments in order to reduce complexity remove redundancies increase the speed of decision making and improve accountability and execution we reduced the number of management layers from our previous structure and increased the average span of control for managers 

redesigning our gotomarket strategy 

we split our direct field sales team into security and information management specialists focused on new business only and expanded their territories to be more effective for our enterprise customers we also built a renewals group in order to extend the customer relationship and make it easier to renew and do business with us we redesigned our global channel strategy focused on building partner competency rewarding performance and customer satisfaction 

changing our product offerings 

with a portfolio of leading products we focused our development efforts on making our point solutions better designing new integrated solutions and expanding our offerings by partnering with network security vendors to offer solutions that provide multitier protection 

financial implications of new strategy 

we have developed a threepronged approach to our product offering strategy which includes managing our portfolio of point solutions and reallocating resources to the offerings we estimate have the greatest growth potential expanding our total addressable market by delivering innovative new offerings that integrate our technologies to solve our customers’ most significant problems and focusing on developing relationships with other industry leaders that will begin the process of building ecosystems that delivers more value to our customers 

we believe that sales and marketing of our innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespeople who can convey the strong value of our technology as such we restructured the 

 

sales organization into new and renewals business teams we also reorganized our direct sales force into functional areas of information security and information management the focus of these specialized teams is to generate new business through new customer acquisition or through broadening existing customer relationships we expect that by separating our direct sales force into specialized teams and focusing on new business we will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our sales process concurrently we created a dedicated renewals team that is focused on extending existing customer relationships and renewing contracts 

we are also investing in our indirect sales channels to build stronger more strategic relationships that enable us to better serve consumers small business and midmarket customers through our channel partner program we are seeking to align our offerings with the optimal route to market leveraging our channel partner capabilities we also plan to align the economics and incentives under these relationships based on the value created by the partner and their commitment to symantec and our customers we believe these changes will help us provide our end customer with highquality sales and postsales support experiences while expanding our business 

as part of our enhanced capital allocation strategy in fiscal 2014 we initiated a quarterly cash dividend in addition to our ongoing share repurchases activity we paid a quarterly dividend in the amount of 015 per share of common stock in each quarter of fiscal 2014 for an aggregate of 418 million or 060 per share during fiscal 2014 all shares of common stock issued and outstanding and unvested restricted stock and performancebased stock as of the record date for any dividend will be entitled to the dividend and dividend equivalents respectively any future dividends and dividend equivalents will be subject to the approval of our board of directors 

our revenue income and cash flows may be impacted by severance other charges and capital expenditures as we execute our organic growth strategy 

new enterprise resource planning system 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2014 following our final testing and data conversion stages we implemented the critical financial reporting module of a new enterprise resource planning “erp” system the costs other than capital expenditures associated with this first phase of implementation of the core operating systems have been recorded in operating expenses as restructuring and transition expenses 

change in management 

on march 20 2014 the board of directors of the company appointed board member michael a brown as interim president and ceo following the termination of stephen m bennett as the company’s president and chief executive officer mr bennett also resigned from the company’s board of directors this change within our management leadership team resulted in certain severance and accelerated stock based compensation expenses 

our operating segments 

our current operating segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services distinguished by customer needs in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we modified our segment reporting structure to more readily match the new operating structure the three reporting segments which are the same as our operating segments are as follows user productivity  protection information security and information management for further description of our operating segments see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

 

financial results and trends 

revenue decreased by 230 million for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to decreases in revenue from our user productivity  protection segment and information management segment following the transition of our sales force into new and renewal business teams we experienced revenue declines domestically and internationally in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 the asia pacific and japan region experienced the largest net revenue decrease followed by americas while the emea region experienced net revenue growth for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 the asia pacific and japan region revenue declined primarily due to foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the weakening of the japanese yen compared to the us dollar while we experienced favorable foreign currency effects in the emea region 

cost of revenue decreased by 26 million for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to decreases in revenue and decreases in intangible assets amortization as certain developed technologies became fully amortized early in fiscal 2014 

operating expenses decreased by 281 million for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to lower salaries and wages resulting from lower headcount lower advertising and promotion expenses and lower amortization of intangible assets as various customer relationship intangibles became fully amortized early in fiscal 2014 for fiscal 2014 we recognized 270 million of restructuring and transition costs we are focused on five priorities for fiscal 2015 these include optimizing our businesses based on lifecycle and growth potential prioritizing investments for growth in our enterprise businesses further reducing costs and improving efficiencies across the company rounding out our talented executive team and continuing to return significant cash to shareholders 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates including judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly historically our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results however actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions if actual results differ from these estimates and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of income and in certain situations could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 

a critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially impact our operating results or financial condition we believe that the estimates described below represent our critical accounting estimates as they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see also note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue primarily pursuant to the requirements under the authoritative guidance on software revenue recognition and any applicable amendments or modifications revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and require us to make estimates 

 

for software arrangements that include multiple elements including perpetual software licenses and maintenance or services packaged products with content updates and subscriptions we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on the fair value using vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue vsoe of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our standalone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance consumer product content updates managed security services subscriptions and arrangements where vsoe does not exist deferred revenue totaled approximately 39 billion as of march 28 2014 of which 581 million was classified as longterm deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets changes to the elements in a software arrangement the ability to identify vsoe for those elements the fair value of the respective elements and increasing flexibility in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount recognized in the current period and deferred over time 

for arrangements that include both software and nonsoftware elements we allocate revenue to the software deliverables as a group and nonsoftware deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vsoe ii thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” and iii best estimate of the selling price “esp” when we are unable to establish a selling price using vsoe or tpe we use esp to allocate the arrangement fees to the deliverables 

for our consumer products that include content updates we recognize revenue and the associated cost of revenue ratably over the term of the subscription upon sellthrough to endusers as the subscription period commences on the date of sale to the enduser we defer revenue and cost of revenue amounts for unsold product held by our distributors and resellers 

we expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate inventory of consumer packaged products to meet future customer demand which is generally four or six weeks of customer demand based on recent buying trends we ship product to our distributors and resellers at their request and based on valid purchase orders our distributors and resellers base the quantity of orders on their estimates to meet future customer demand which may exceed the expected level of a four or six week supply we offer limited rights of return if the inventory held by our distributors and resellers is below the expected level of a four or six week supply we estimate reserves for product returns as described below we typically offer liberal rights of return if inventory held by our distributors and resellers exceeds the expected level because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of excess inventory that will be returned we primarily offset deferred revenue against trade accounts receivable for the amount of revenue in excess of the expected inventory levels 

arrangements for maintenance subscriptions managed security services and saas offerings are generally offered to our customers over a specified period of time and we recognize the related revenue ratably over the maintenance subscription or service period 

reserves for product returns we reserve for estimated product returns as an offset to revenue or deferred revenue based primarily on historical trends we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels as an offset to deferred revenue actual product returns may be different than what was estimated these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make actual results differ from our return estimates 

reserves for rebates we estimate and record reserves for channel and enduser rebates as an offset to revenue or deferred revenue for consumer products that include content updates rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue or deferred revenue over the term of the subscription our estimated reserves for channel 

 

volume incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and resellers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs which are typically entered into quarterly our reserves for enduser rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the promotional programs actual sales during the promotion the amount of actual redemptions received historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program and the value of the rebate we also consider current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserves for rebates if actual redemptions differ from our estimates material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented 

valuation of goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets 

business combination valuations when we acquire businesses we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies and historical experience these estimates can include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

 these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and if such events occur we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities 

goodwill impairment we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable at the reporting unit level our reporting units are the same as our operating segments a qualitative assessment is first made to determine whether it is necessary to perform quantitative testing this initial assessment includes among others consideration of i past current and projected future earnings and equity ii recent trends and market conditions and iii valuation metrics involving similar companies that are publiclytraded and acquisitions of similar companies if available if this initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that impairment exists a second step is taken involving a comparison between the estimated fair values of our reporting units with their respective carrying amounts including goodwill the methods for estimating reporting unit values include asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows and multiples of earnings or revenues if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and a third step is performed to measure the amount of impairment the third step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting units over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets less liabilities if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 

 

the process of estimating the fair value and carrying value of our reporting units’ equity requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis many assets and liabilities such as accounts receivable and property and equipment are not specifically allocated to an individual reporting unit and therefore we apply judgment to allocate the assets and liabilities and this allocation affects the carrying value of the respective reporting units similarly we use judgment to allocate goodwill to the reporting units based on relative fair values the use of relative fair values has been necessary for certain reporting units due to changes in our operating structure in prior years to determine a reporting unit’s fair value we use the income approach under which we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit we evaluate the reasonableness of this approach by comparing it with the market approach which involves a review of the carrying value of our assets relative to our market capitalization and to the valuation of publicly traded companies operating in the same or similar lines of business 

applying the income approach requires that we make a number of important estimates and assumptions we estimate the future cash flows of each reporting unit based on historical and forecasted revenue and operating costs this in turn involves further estimates such as estimates of future revenue and expense growth rates in addition we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation this discount rate is based on the estimated weightedaverage cost of capital for each reporting unit and may change from year to year changes in these key estimates and assumptions or in other assumptions used in this process could materially affect our impairment analysis for a given year 

as of march 28 2014 our goodwill balance was 59 billion amongst our reporting units based on a qualitative impairment analysis performed as of december 28 2013 we determined that it was more likely than not that there was no impairment in any of our reporting units 

a number of factors many of which we have no ability to control could affect our financial condition operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 intangible asset impairment we assess the impairment of identifiable finitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset group’s carrying amount may not be recoverable recoverability of certain finitelived intangible assets particularly customer relationships and finitelived trade names would be measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset group to which the 

 

assets are assigned to the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows the asset group is expected to generate if an asset is considered to be impaired the amount of such impairment would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value recoverability and impairment of other finitelived intangible assets particularly developed technology and patents would be measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of undiscounted estimated future product revenues offset by estimated future costs to dispose of the product to which the asset relates for indefinitelived intangible assets we review impairment on an annual basis consistent with the timing of the annual evaluation for goodwill these assets generally include trade names and trademarks similar to goodwill impairment testing a qualitative assessment is first made to determine whether it is necessary to perform quantitative testing this initial assessment includes consideration of among other things i past current and projected future revenues ii recent trends and market conditions including discount rates and iv valuation metrics such as royalty rates involving similar companies that are publiclytraded if available if this initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that impairment exists a second step is taken this step involves a comparison between the fair values of the assets and their respective carrying amounts any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value would be recognized as an impairment charge our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted future revenue operating costs and other relevant factors assumptions and estimates about the remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are subjective and are affected by changes to our business strategies if management’s estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other assumptions the estimate of the fair value of our identifiable intangible assets could change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 

longlived assets we assess longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the longlived assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment we assess recoverability of longlived assets based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method using assumptions determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model if an asset is not recoverable impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and its fair value our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors which could change and cause a material impact to our operating results or financial condition we record impairment charges on longlived assets held for sale when we determine that the carrying value of the longlived assets may not be recoverable in determining fair value we obtain and consider market value appraisal information from third parties 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance stockbased compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is generally recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period of the respective award 

we issue performancebased restricted stock units “prus” and performancecontingent stock units “pcsus” representing hypothetical shares of our common stock each pru and pcsu grant reflects a target number of shares that may be issued to the award recipient the actual number of prus the recipient receives is determined at the end of a threeyear performance period as follows 1 our achievement of an annual target earnings per share for the first fiscal year of grant and 2 our two and three year cumulative relative total shareholder return ranked against that of other companies that are included in the standard  poor’s 500 index the pcsus vest based upon the performance of symantec’s common stock over a threeyear period and are also subject to an underlying continued service vesting condition we estimate the fair value of prus using the monte carlo simulation option pricing model “monte carlo model” as the total shareholder return modifier contains a market condition we estimate the fair value and derived service period of pcsus using the monte carlo model as this statistical model can simulate a range of possible future stock prices for symantec because our prus include dividendequivalent rights the fair values of prus are not discounted by the dividend yield 

 

determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment we use the blackscholesmerton option pricing model “bsm model” to determine the fair value of stock options the determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the options actual and projected employee stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends 

we estimate the expected life of options granted based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and postvesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option expected volatility is based on the average of historical volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of traded options the risk free interest rate is equal to the us treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal to the expected life if options are granted or assumed without dividendequivalents rights the fair values are discounted by the dividend yield prior to the initial declaration of a quarterly cash dividend on may 2 2013 the fair value of options was measured based on an expected dividend yield of 0 as we did not historically pay cash dividends on our common stock for awards granted on or subsequent to june 27 2013 we used an annualized dividend yield based on the per share dividends declared by our board of directors see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation we record stockbased compensation expense for awards that are expected to vest as a result judgment is required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience actual forfeitures may differ if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted when we record an adjustment for the difference in the period that the awards vest or are forfeited 

contingencies and litigation 

we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on contingencies we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes from potential claims or legal proceedings as well as potential ranges of probable losses when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and reasonably estimable a determination of the amount of accrued liabilities required if any for these contingencies is made after the analysis of each separate matter because of uncertainties related to these matters we base our estimates on the information available at the time of our assessment as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates any revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our operating results and financial position 

income taxes 

we are required to compute our income taxes in each federal state and international jurisdiction in which we operate this process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes the income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as current or longterm deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets our judgments assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income 

 

our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding indefinitely reinvested earnings outside the united states material changes in our estimates of such earnings or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of such earnings could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate if certain foreign earnings previously treated as indefinitely reinvested outside the united states are repatriated the related us tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings 

we account for uncertain tax positions pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a twostep approach to recognize and measure those positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the refinement of estimates or the realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statements of income in the period in which such determination is made 

we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and based on this assessment establish a valuation allowance if required the determination of our valuation allowance involves assumptions judgments and estimates including forecasted earnings future taxable income and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our consolidated statements of income 

results of operations 

total net revenue 

 

 fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 

content subscription and maintenance revenue represented 89 87 and 87 of total net revenue for the fiscal years ended 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively content subscription and maintenance revenue decreased primarily due to decreases from our user productivity  protection segment of 48 million and information management segment of 26 million offset by an increase of 13 million from our information security segment license revenue includes sales of software licenses appliances and certain revenue sharing arrangements license revenue decreased primarily due to declines from our information management segment of 89 million user productivity  protection segment of 62 million and information security segment of 17 million 

 

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

content subscription and maintenance revenue increased primarily due to increases from our information management segment of 97 million and information security segment of 96 million license revenue decreased primarily due to a decline from our information management segment of 26 million 

net revenue and operating income by segment 

user productivity  protection 

 

 fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 

user productivity  protection revenue declined primarily due to a 53 million decline in endpoint management sales as well as declines in pc tools revenue of 21 million and decreases in certain services activities and encryption revenues of 30 million user productivity  protection operating income increased primarily due to lower advertising and promotional expenses of 123 million as well as a decline in salaries and wages of 34 million

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

user productivity  protection revenue remained relatively flat user productivity  protection operating income decreased primarily due to increased salaries and wages of 35 million partially offset by lower advertising and promotional expenses of 59 million 

information security segment 

 

 fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 

information security revenue remained relatively flat year over year the increase in operating income was mainly due to lower salaries and wages of 57 million lower advertising and promotion expenses of 12 million lower outside services expenses of 26 million and reductions in other expenses of 54 million 

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

information security revenue increased primarily due to the growth in our user authentication and trust services offerings of 73 million managed security services of 24 million and data loss prevention products of 14 million partially offset by a decline in our hosted security suite offerings of 12 million information security operating income increased primarily due to higher revenue and lower salaries and wages of 37 million 

 

information management segment 

 

 fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 

information management revenue decreased primarily due to an 80 million decline in our information availability offerings a decrease of 50 million from our backup exec products and a decrease of 12 million from our enterprise vault products these decreases were partially offset by growth in our netbackup appliance business of 31 million information management operating income decreased primarily from decreases in revenue and higher materials costs related to our appliances business coupled with higher costs associated with our services business 

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

information management revenue increased primarily due to increases in our netbackup business of 151 million coupled with increases in our enterprise vault products of 35 million partially offset by declines in our backup exec offerings of 80 million and declines in our information availability offerings of 47 million the decrease in operating income was primarily due to higher cost of revenue of 62 million higher salaries and wages of 24 million higher equipment costs outside services and other costs of 49 million 

net revenue by geographic region 

 

  

fluctuations in the us dollar compared to foreign currencies unfavorably impacted our international revenue by approximately 20 million for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 this was due to a 90 million unfavorable foreign currency fluctuation in the asia pacific and japan region partially offset by a favorable foreign currency fluctuation of 70 million in the emea region for fiscal 2013 as compared 2012 we had an unfavorable foreign currency exchange effect of 141 million 118 million from the emea region while the remainder of the variance was from the asia pacific and japan region 

our international sales are and are expected to continue to be a significant portion of our revenue as a result revenue is expected to continue to be affected by foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the us dollar we are unable to predict the extent to which revenue in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates if international sales become a greater portion of our total sales in the future changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenue and operating results 

cost of revenue 

 

 fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 

cost of content subscription and maintenance consists primarily of technical support costs costs of billable services and fees to oems under revenuesharing agreements cost of license consists primarily of royalties paid to third parties under technology licensing agreements appliance manufacturing costs and other direct material costs 

intangible assets are primarily comprised of developed technologies and patents from acquired companies amortization decreased for fiscal 2014 as certain developed technologies became fully amortized early in fiscal 2014 

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

cost of content subscription and maintenance increased for fiscal 2013 primarily due to higher technical support services and oem royalty costs the increased costs were due to growth in our business and higher royalty payments to major oem partners as part of revenuesharing arrangements cost of license increased primarily due to higher direct costs associated with the appliance business 

amortization decreased for fiscal 2013 due to certain developed technologies becoming fully amortized partially offset by the incremental amortization associated with our fiscal 2012 acquisitions 

 

operating expenses 

 

  

 

 fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 

sales and marketing expense decreased for fiscal 2014 primarily due to lower salaries and wages of 159 million resulting from lower headcount and lower advertising and promotion expenses of 146 million our sales and marketing expense in fiscal 2014 was also impacted by the changes in our gotomarket strategy as described above under “overviewstrategyredesigning our gotomarketstrategy” 

the increase in research and development for fiscal 2014 was primarily due to higher equipment cost including depreciation and amortization of 23 million 

amortization of intangible assets decreased by 130 million primarily as a result of various customer relationship intangibles becoming fully amortized early in fiscal 2014 

restructuring and transition costs consist of severance facilities transition and other related costs associated with our organization simplification for fiscal 2014 we recognized 212 million of restructuring 49 million in transition costs related to our erp system and 9 million in other transition costs for further information on restructuring and transition costs see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we experienced favorable foreign currency effects on our operating expenses of 42 million in the year ended march 28 2014 as compared to the same period last year 

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

sales and marketing expense decreased primarily due to lower advertising and promotional expenses of 73 million which was attributed to lower placement fees this decrease was offset by higher salaries and wages of 53 million due to higher headcount 

research and development expense increased due to higher salaries and wages expenses of 36 million which was attributed to increased headcount to support our continued investment in product development 

 

restructuring and transition costs consist of transition severance facilities and other related costs for fiscal 2013 we recognized 114 million of transition and other related costs 10 million of severance and 1 million of facilities costs for further information on restructuring and transition costs see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

we experienced favorable foreign currency effects on our operating expenses of 99 million in the year ended march 29 2013 as compared to the year ended in fiscal 2012 

nonoperating income expense 

 

 fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 

the decrease in nonoperating expense net is primarily driven by a realized gain from sale of shortterm investments of 32 million during fiscal 2014 coupled with a decrease in interest expense of 55 million as we experienced lower amortization of debt issuance costs and discounts following the maturity of our 10 billion 100 notes in june 2013 

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 we issued 600 million in principal amount of 275 interestbearing senior notes due june 2017 and 400 million in principal amount of 395 interestbearing senior notes due june 2022 which resulted in interest expense of 26 million in fiscal 2013 other income expense net increased due to a tax incentive received from the china tax bureau in the form of valueadded tax refunds of 33 million 

provision for income taxes 

 

 our effective tax rate was approximately 22 25 and 21 in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

the tax expense in fiscal 2014 was reduced by the following benefits 1 33 million for the resolution of a tax matter related to the sale of our 49 ownership interest in the joint venture with huawei during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 2 24 million for tax benefits related to the settlement of the symantec 2005 through 2008 internal revenue service “irs” audit 3 15 million tax benefit related to certain foreign operations and 4 13 million from lapses of statutes of limitation these tax benefits were partially offset by 12 million in tax expense resulting from the sale of shortterm investments 

 

the tax expense in fiscal 2013 was reduced by the following benefits 1 17 million tax benefits arising from the veritas 2002 through 2005 irs appeals matters including adjustments to state liabilities and a reduction of interest accrued 2 13 million in tax benefits resulting from tax settlements and adjustments to prior year items 3 10 million from lapses of statutes of limitation and 4 2 million for the benefit of the research credit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 resulting from the extension of the federal research credit as part of the 2012 taxpayer relief act these tax benefits were offset by a 9 million tax expense from an increase in valuation allowance on state research tax credits 

the tax expense in fiscal 2012 was reduced by the following benefits 1 52 million tax benefit arising from the veritas 2002 through 2005 irs appeals matters 2 14 million from lapses of statutes of limitation 3 17 million from the settlements and effective settlements with tax authorities and related remeasurements and 4 5 million tax benefit from adjustments related to prior year items this benefit was partially offset by a 5 million tax expense resulting from a change in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets 

the effective tax rates for all periods presented otherwise reflect the benefits of lowertaxed international earnings and losses from our joint venture with huawei technologies co limited domestic manufacturing incentives and research and development credits the us federal research and development credit expired on december 31 2013 partially offset by state income taxes pretax income from international operations was significantly higher in fiscal 2012 due to the sale of our 49 ownership interest in the joint venture to huawei on march 30 2012 for 526 million a significant portion of the sale proceeds was attributable to international tax jurisdictions resulting in a 20 tax rate on the sale of the joint venture reducing the overall tax rate in fiscal 2012 by 3 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and international tax jurisdictions a substantial portion of our international earnings were generated from subsidiaries organized in ireland and singapore our results of operations would be adversely affected to the extent that our geographical mix of income becomes more weighted toward jurisdictions with higher tax rates and would be favorably affected to the extent the relative geographic mix shifts to lower tax jurisdictions any change in our mix of earnings is dependent upon many factors and is therefore difficult to predict

in assessing the ability to realize our deferred tax assets we considered whether it was more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we considered the following we have historical cumulative book income as measured by the current and prior two years we have strong consistent taxpaying history we have substantial us federal income tax carryback potential and we have substantial amounts of scheduled future reversals of taxable temporary differences from our deferred tax liabilities levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in part i item 1a risk factors set forth in this annual report we have concluded that this positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence and thus that the deferred tax assets as of march 28 2014 of 347 million after application of the valuation allowances described above are realizable on a “more likely than not” basis 

on december 2 2009 we received a revenue agent’s report from the irs for the veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years assessing additional taxes due we contested 80 million of the tax assessed and all penalties as a result of negotiations with irs appeals in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we remeasured our liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting in a tax benefit of 52 million we executed the final closing agreement for the veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years on december 26 2012 accordingly we recorded a further tax benefit of 3 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 based on the closing agreement further we amended our state tax returns for the veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 to reflect the adjustments in the closing agreement and remeasured our state liability resulting in a benefit of 7 million 

 

the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain and the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year although potential resolution of uncertain tax positions involve multiple tax periods and jurisdictions it is reasonably possible that the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to these audits could decrease whether by payment release or a combination of both in the next 12 months by between 20 million and 140 million 

we continue to monitor the progress of ongoing tax controversies and the impact if any of the expected tolling of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions 

noncontrolling interest 

in fiscal 2011 we completed the acquisition of the identity and authentication business of verisign including a controlling interest in its subsidiary verisign japan kk “verisign japan” a publicly traded company on the tokyo stock exchange given our majority ownership interest of 54 in verisign japan the accounts of verisign japan have been consolidated with our accounts and a noncontrolling interest had been recorded for the noncontrolling investors’ interests in the equity and operations of verisign japan during the second quarter of fiscal 2013 we completed a tender offer and paid 92 million to acquire verisign japan common shares and stock rights which increased our ownership percentage to 92 during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we acquired the remaining 8 interest for 19 million and verisign japan became a whollyowned subsidiary the payment was made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional information for fiscal 2013 and 2012 the loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest in verisign japan was approximately 0 million 

liquidity and capital resources 

sources of cash 

we have historically relied on cash flow from operations borrowings under a credit facility and issuances of debt and equity securities for our liquidity needs as of march 28 2014 we had cash and cash equivalents of 37 billion and an unused credit facility of 10 billion resulting in a liquidity position of 47 billion as of march 28 2014 25 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable equity securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries we have provided us deferred taxes on a portion of our undistributed foreign earnings sufficient to address the incremental us tax that would be due if we needed such portion of these funds to support our operations in the us 

senior notes in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 we issued 600 million in principal amount of 275 senior notes due june 2017 and 400 million in principal amount of 395 senior notes due june 2022 for an aggregate principal amount of 10 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 we issued 350 million in principal amount of 275 senior notes due september 2015 and 750 million in principal amount of 420 senior notes due september 2020 for an aggregate principal amount of 11 billion

revolving credit facility in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 we entered into a 10 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility “credit facility” which was amended in the first quarter of 2013 to extend the term to june 2017 under the terms of this credit facility we must comply with certain financial and nonfinancial covenants including a debt to ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization covenant as of march 28 2014 we were in compliance with all required covenants and there was no outstanding balance on the credit facility 

we believe that our existing cash and investment balances our available revolving credit facility our ability to issue new debt instruments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital 

 

and capital expenditure requirements as well as to fund any cash dividends principal and interest payments on debt and repurchases of our stock for at least the next 12 months and foreseeable future we have implemented a capital allocation strategy pursuant to which we expect to return over time approximately 50 of free cash flow to stockholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases while still enabling our company to invest in its future our strategy emphasizes organic growth through internal innovation and will be complemented by acquisitions that fit strategically and meet specific internal profitability hurdles 

uses of cash 

our principal cash requirements include working capital capital expenditures payments of principal and interest on our debt and payments of taxes also we may from time to time engage in the open market purchase of our notes prior to their maturity furthermore our capital allocation strategy contemplates a quarterly cash dividend in addition we regularly evaluate our ability to repurchase stock pay debts and acquire other businesses

indemnifications 

in the ordinary course of business we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers vendors lessors business partners subsidiaries and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of agreements or representations and warranties made by us in addition our bylaws contain indemnification obligations to our directors officers employees and agents and we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers to give such directors and officers additional contractual assurances regarding the scope of the indemnification set forth in our bylaws and to provide additional procedural protections we maintain director and officer insurance which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers it is not possible to determine the aggregate maximum potential loss under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement such indemnification agreements might not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements and we have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our consolidated financial statements 

we provide limited product warranties and the majority of our software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging that our software infringes on the intellectual property rights of a third party historically payments made under these provisions have been immaterial we monitor the conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a loss has occurred 

recently issued authoritative guidance 

there was no recently issued authoritative guidance that had a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices we may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies we do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

as of march 28 2014 we had 210 billion in principal amount of fixedrate senior notes outstanding with a carrying amount of 210 billion and a fair value of 217 billion which fair value is based on level 2 inputs of market prices for similar debt instruments and resulting yields we have performed sensitivity analyses as of march 28 2014 by using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 50 bps movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant on march 28 2014 a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixedrate senior notes by a decrease of approximately 48 million and an increase of approximately 49 million respectively however this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we conduct business in 38 currencies through our worldwide operations and as such we are exposed to foreign currency risk foreign currency risks are associated with our cash and cash equivalents investments receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies our exposure to foreign currency transaction gains 

 

and losses is the result of certain net receivables due from our foreign subsidiaries and customers being denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary primarily the euro and singapore dollar our foreign subsidiaries conduct their businesses in local currency we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts with up to six months in duration to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates for all currencies could be experienced the estimated impacts of a five or ten percent appreciation or depreciation in value are as follows 

 

 we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of the changes in foreign exchange rates

strategy 

the company is in the midst of a transformation new types of solutions and new market opportunities are emerging as customers look to us to innovate across a digital landscape that has expanded enormously for both consumers and businesses as we think about our markets today it is very clear that the industry needs a new model for protection we are transitioning from being devicecentric which meant protecting endpoints and the data center to having the broader focus of protecting and managing digital information individuals businesses and other organizations use new ways to access their digital information creating new opportunities for us to develop products and services which address mobile devices web services web platforms and the emerging software defined data center and network our strategy is to establish leadership in this evolving informationcentric world by identifying and delivering security and information management solutions that solve large unmet or underserved customer needs while building competitive advantage and creating sustainable financial performance 

to successfully implement our strategy we are focusing on three areas developing innovative products and services changing our gotomarket “gtm” strategy and simplifying our organizational structure 

developing innovative products and services 

with data exploding at exponential rates and the sophistication of attacks evolving rapidly it is increasingly important to secure and manage valuable data we see significant opportunity in security and information management where we have market leading technologies we are focused on providing comprehensive solutions for mobile and traditional endpoints the cloud and increasingly virtualized datacenters we expect to further expand our offerings by partnering with network vendors to offer solutions in the network space 

with a portfolio of leading products we intend to focus our development efforts on making our point solutions better while developing new integrated solutions that are aimed at solving important customer problems the three areas of focus include 

 

  

  

 changing our gotomarket strategy 

a significant portion of our revenue from enterprise products is derived from sales to end users by our direct sales force we believe that sales of our innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable 

  

salespeople who can convey the strong value of our technology as such we are reorganizing our direct sales force into functional areas of security and information management the focus of these specialized teams will be to generate new sales opportunities we expect that by dividing our direct sales force into specialized teams we will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our sales process 

concurrently we are creating a dedicated renewals team that will be focused on extending the customer relationship and renewing contracts we are also streamlining our indirect sales channels to effectively reach customers we intend to have fewer more focused partners additionally we intend to reorient our partner programs to enhance reseller sales we believe these changes will ensure that we provide our end customers with a highquality sales and postsales support experiences while expanding our business 

simplifying the organization 

aligning our organization by functional areas rather than by market segments will create an opportunity to reduce complexity remove redundancies increase the speed of decision making and improve accountability and execution by the fall of 2013 we expect to reduce the number of management layers from our existing structure we also intend to increase the average span of control for managers 

capital allocation strategy 

our enhanced capital allocation strategy is expected to return over time approximately 50 of free cash flow to stockholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases while still enabling our company to invest in its future our strategy will emphasize organic growth through internal innovation and will be complemented by acquisitions that fit strategically and meet specific internal profitability hurdles 

our capital allocation program includes the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend targeting a yield of approximately 25 based on our closing stock price on may 1 2013 on may 2 2013 our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 015 per share of common stock the first dividend in symantec’s history to be paid on june 27 2013 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on june 19 2013 any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our board of directors 

our board of directors also approved a new 10 billion stock repurchase program this program does not have an expiration date including our previously approved stock repurchase program 12 billion remained authorized for future repurchases as of march 29 2013 

the initiation of quarterly dividends coupled with the increased stock repurchase program underscores our commitment to consistently return capital to stockholders and shows confidence in our longterm business outlook and our ability to generate a significant amount of cash on a consistent basis

customers 

in fiscal 2013 and 2012 there were no significant customers that accounted for more than 10 of our total net revenue in fiscal 2011 one distributor ingram micro accounted for 10 of our total net revenue our distributor arrangements with ingram micro consisted of several nonexclusive independently negotiated agreements with its subsidiaries each of which cover different countries or regions each of these agreements was separately negotiated and was independent of any other contract such as a master distribution agreement and these agreements were not based on the same form of contract 

acquisitions 

our strategy will be complemented by business combinations that fit strategically and meet specific profitability hurdles our acquisitions are designed to enhance the features and functionality of our existing products and extend our product leadership in core markets we consider timetomarket synergies with existing products and potential market share gains when evaluating the economics of acquisitions of technologies product lines or companies we may acquire or dispose of other technologies products and companies in the future 

  

we did not make any material acquisitions during fiscal 2013 for further discussion of our acquisitions see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

competition 

our markets are consolidating highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology the competitive landscape has changed significantly over the past few years with new competition arising much of the market growth has come from startups whose focus is on solving a specific customer issue or delivering a specific nicheoriented product and from larger integration providers that increasingly are looking to put various types of protection whether it is backup high availability or security into their platforms we are focused on delivering comprehensive customer solutions integrating across our broad product portfolio and partnering with other technology providers to differentiate ourselves from the competition we believe that the principal competitive factors necessary to be successful in our industry include product quality and effectiveness timetomarket price reputation financial stability breadth of product offerings customer support brand recognition and effective sales and marketing efforts 

in addition to the competition we face from direct competitors we face indirect or potential competition from retailers application providers operating system providers network equipment manufacturers and other oems who may provide various solutions and functions in their current and future products we also compete for access to retail distribution channels and for spending at the retail level and in corporate accounts in addition we compete with other software companies operating system providers network equipment manufacturers and other oems to acquire technologies products or companies and to publish software developed by third parties we also compete with other software companies in our effort to place our products on the computer equipment sold to consumers and enterprises by oems 

the competitive environments for each segment are described below 

consumer 

most of the channels in which our consumer products are offered are highly competitive our competitors are intensely focused on customer acquisition which has led competitors to offer their technology for free engage in aggressive marketing or enter into competitive partnerships our primary competitors in the consumer segment are mcafee inc owned by intel corporation “mcafee” and trend micro inc “trend micro” there are also several freeware providers and regional security companies that we compete against for our consumer backup offerings our primary competitors are carbonite inc and mozy inc owned by emc corporation “emc” 

security and compliance 

in the security and management markets we compete against many companies that offer competing products to our solutions our primary competitors in the security and management market are mcafee microsoft corporation “microsoft” and trend micro there are also several smaller regional security companies with which we compete in the authentication services market our primary competitors are comodo group inc rsa the security division of emc entrust inc and godaddycom inc in the softwareasaservice “saas” security market our primary competitors are google inc’s postini services and microsoft our primary competitors in the managed services business are secureworks inc owned by dell inc and verizon communications inc 

storage and server management 

the markets for storage management backup archiving and ediscovery are intensely competitive our primary competitors are commvault systems inc emc hewlettpackard company ibm oracle and veeam software 

  

intellectual property 

protective measures 

we regard some of the features of our internal operations software and documentation as proprietary and rely on copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures contractual arrangements and other measures to protect our proprietary information our intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that enables us to gain recognition for our products services and technology and enhance our competitive position 

as part of our confidentiality procedures we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with our employees distributors and corporate partners and we enter into license agreements with respect to our software documentation and other proprietary information these license agreements are generally nontransferable and have a perpetual term we also educate our employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to protect our facilities equipment and networks 

trademarks patents copyrights and licenses 

symantec and the symantec logo are trademarks or registered trademarks in the us and other countries in addition to symantec and the symantec logo we have used registered or applied to register other specific trademarks and service marks to help distinguish our products technologies and services from those of our competitors in the us and foreign countries and jurisdictions we enforce our trademark service mark and trade name rights in the us and abroad the duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country and in the us we generally are able to maintain our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in use 

we have more than 1900 patents in addition to foreign patents and pending us and foreign patent applications which relate to various aspects of our products and technology the duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and for the us is typically 17 years from the date of issuance of the patent or 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application resulting in the patent which we believe is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products 

our products are protected under us and international copyright laws and laws related to the protection of intellectual property and proprietary information we take measures to label such products with the appropriate proprietary rights notices and we actively enforce such rights in the us and abroad however these measures may not provide sufficient protection and our intellectual property rights may be challenged in addition we license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our products and generally must rely on the third party to protect the licensed intellectual property rights while we believe that our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent trademark license or other intellectual property right 

seasonality 

as is typical for many large software companies our business is seasonal software license and maintenance orders are generally higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and lower in our first and second fiscal quarters a decline in license and maintenance orders is typical in the first quarter of our fiscal year as compared to license and maintenance orders in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year in addition we generally receive a higher volume of software license and maintenance orders in the last month of a quarter with orders concentrated in the latter part of that month we believe that this seasonality primarily reflects customer spending patterns and budget cycles as well as the impact of compensation incentive plans for our sales personnel revenue generally reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than orders because revenue is not recognized until an order is shipped or services are performed and other revenue recognition criteria are met and because a significant portion of our inperiod revenue comes from our deferred revenue balance 

  

employees 

as of march 29 2013 we employed more than 21500 people worldwide approximately 44  of whom reside in the us approximately 7400 employees work in sales and marketing 7200 in research and development 5400 in support and services and 1500 in management manufacturing and administration

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below the list is not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock 

fluctuations in demand for our products and services are driven by many factors and a decrease in demand for our products could adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and services due to a variety of factors including general economic conditions competition product obsolescence technological change shifts in buying patterns financial difficulties and budget constraints of our current and potential customers levels of broadband usage awareness of security threats to it systems and other factors while such factors may in some periods increase product sales fluctuations in demand can also negatively impact our product sales if demand for our products and solutions declines whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in buying patterns our revenues and margins would likely be adversely affected 

if we are unable to develop new and enhanced products and services that achieve widespread market acceptance or if we are unable to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our existing products and services or adapt our business model to keep pace with industry trends our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our future success depends on our ability to respond to the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing or introducing new products product upgrades and services on a timely basis we have in the past incurred and will continue to incur significant research and development expenses as we strive to remain competitive new product development and introduction involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 if we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges or if our new products product upgrades and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

we operate in a highly competitive environment and our competitors may gain market share in the markets for our products that could adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to decline 

we operate in intensely competitive markets that experience rapid technological developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements if we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a decline in our sales that could adversely affect our business and operating results to compete successfully we must maintain an innovative research and development effort to develop new products and services and enhance existing products and services effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors appropriately respond to competitive strategies and effectively adapt to technological changes and changes in the ways that our information is accessed used and stored within our enterprise and consumer markets if we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors or to changing technological and customer demands our competitive position and our financial results could be adversely affected 

our traditional competitors include independent software vendors that offer software products that directly compete with our product offerings we expect that competition may intensify as a result of future software industry consolidation in addition to competing with these vendors directly for sales to endusers of our products we compete with them for the opportunity to have our products bundled with the product offerings of our strategic partners such as computer hardware oems and isps our competitors could gain market share from us if any of these strategic partners replace our products with the products of our competitors or if these partners more actively promote our competitors’ products than our products in addition software vendors who have bundled our products with theirs may choose to bundle their software with their own or other vendors’ software or may limit our access to standard product interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop products for their platform in the future further product development by these vendors could cause our software applications and services to become redundant which could significantly impact our sales and financial results 

we face growing competition from network equipment computer hardware manufacturers large operating system providers and other technology companies these firms are increasingly developing and incorporating into their products data protection and storage and server management software that competes at some levels with our product offerings our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our products 

security protection is also offered by some of our competitors at prices lower than our prices or in some cases is offered free of charge some companies offer the lowerpriced or free security products within their computer hardware or software products that we believe are inferior to our products and saas offerings our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive these security products 

  

as replacing the need for more effective full featured products and services such as those that we provide the expansion of these competitive trends could have a significant negative impact on our sales and financial results by causing among other things price reductions of our products reduced profitability and loss of market share 

many of our competitors have greater financial technical sales marketing or other resources than we do and consequently may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their products instead of ours further consolidation within our industry or other changes in the competitive environment such as intel corporation’s acquisition of mcafee could result in larger competitors that compete with us on several levels we also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the markets in which we compete 

our business models present execution and competitive risks 

in recent years our saas offerings have become increasingly critical in our business our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying saas offerings for consumers and business customers pricing and delivery models are evolving devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own saas strategies we cannot assure you that our investments in and development of saas offerings will achieve the expected returns for us or that we will be able to compete successfully in the marketplace in addition to software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support saas offerings these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we are successful in this business model depends on our execution in a number of areas including 

 

  

 our increasing focus on the delivery of products in an appliance form factor creates new business and financial risks 

since fiscal 2012 shipments of products to customers in an appliance form factor have represented an increasingly larger part of our revenues and we expect this trend to continue the delivery of solutions in the form of appliances creates new business and financial risks including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we cannot assure you that we will continue to have success in our appliance business 

  

we have begun investing in a plan to better meet customer needs through internal innovation and driving faster organic growth with a particular focus on key areas that combine our existing products and services into new solutions that are designed to meet multiple customer needs with integrated higher value offerings and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect our operating results may be harmed 

pursuant to our recently announced restructuring plan we have been reallocating talent within our organization and are dedicating spending and resources to focus on certain key areas such as mobile workforce productivity norton protection norton cloud information security services identitycontentaware security gateway data center security business continuity integrated backup cloudbased information management and object storage platform we expect research and development expenses to increase through fiscal 2017 as we invest to drive organic innovation for our customers while we will seek to have the right level of investment and the right level of resources focused on our biggest growth opportunities the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

over the long term we intend to invest in engineering sales service marketing and manufacturing activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results 

while we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses over the long term we also intend to invest in research and development activities as we focus on organic growth through internal innovation we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

defects or disruptions in our saas offerings could reduce demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability 

our saas offerings may contain errors or defects that users identify after they begin using them that could result in unanticipated service interruptions which could harm our reputation and our business since our customers use our saas offerings for missioncritical protection from threats to electronic information endpoint devices and computer networks any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems with our saas offerings could significantly harm our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses if that occurs customers could elect not to renew or delay or withhold payment to us we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation 

risks related to the provision of our saas offerings could impair our ability to deliver our services and could expose us to liability damage our brand and reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business 

we currently serve our saasbased customers from hosting facilities located across the globe damage to or failure of any significant element of these hosting facilities could result in interruptions in our service which could harm our customers and expose us to liability interruptions or failures in our service delivery could cause customers to terminate their subscriptions with us could adversely affect our renewal rates and could harm our ability to attract new customers our business would also be harmed if our customers believe that our saas offerings are unreliable as we continue to offer more of our software products in a saasbased delivery model all of these risks could be exacerbated 

our saas offerings also involve the storage and transmission of large amounts of our customers’ proprietary information including sensitive and personally identifiable information breaches of our security measures or the 

  

accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business despite our precautions and significant ongoing investments to protect against such breaches our security measures could be breached at any time and could result in unauthorized third parties obtaining access to our or our customers’ data any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our saas offerings could reduce sales and constrain consumer and business customer adoption of our saas offering in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further security measures could be significant 

if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to their customers our operating results could be adversely affected 

we sell our products to customers around the world through multitiered sales and distribution networks sales through these different channels involve distinct risks including the following 

direct sales  a significant portion of our revenues from enterprise products is derived from sales by our direct sales force to endusers special risks associated with direct sales include 

 

  

  

 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we announced a plan to refocus our direct field sales representatives on generating new business and to create over time a dedicated renewals team transitions of this kind can be disruptive to the sales organization and could exacerbate the risks noted above 

indirect sales channels  a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels including distributors that sell our products to endusers and other resellers this channel involves a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

 oem sales channels  a portion of our revenues is derived from sales through our oem partners that incorporate our products into or bundle our products with their products our reliance on this sales channel involves many risks including 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

 if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels successfully these channels may conflict with one another or otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate which could reduce our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our competitive position some of our distribution partners have experienced financial difficulties in the past and if our partners suffer financial difficulties in the future because of general economic conditions or for other reasons these partners may delay paying their obligations to us and we may have reduced sales or increased bad debt expense that could adversely affect our operating results in addition reliance on multiple channels subjects us to events that could cause unpredictability in demand which could increase the risk that we may be unable to plan effectively for the future and could result in adverse operating results in future periods 

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairments 

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically reallocate our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel reschedule or adjust with contract manufacturers and suppliers further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to evaluate goodwill impairment on an annual basis and between annual evaluations in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment evaluations may result in a charge to earnings 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we announced a new strategy designed to drive organic growth simplify our operating model and concentrate our focus on selected key areas we expect this plan to involve significant transitions as we among other things eliminate duplicative organization and operating structures we will incur significant restructuring charges as we implement these activities the changes to our business model may be disruptive and the revised model that we adopt may not be more efficient or effective than the aspects of our business model that are being revised our restructuring activities including any related charges and related headcount reduction could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

we are currently planning and designing information systems enhancements and problems with the design or implementation of these enhancements could interfere with our business and operations 

we are currently in the process of significantly enhancing our information systems including planning and designing a new enterprise resource planning system the implementation of significant enhancements to information systems is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise which may especially be the case for us due to the size and complexity of our businesses any disruptions relating to our systems enhancements particularly any disruptions impacting our operations during the design or implementation periods could adversely affect our ability to process customer orders ship products provide services and support to our customers bill and track our customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business even if we do not encounter these adverse effects the planning designing and implementation may be much more costly than we anticipated if we are unable to successfully plan design or implement the information systems enhancements as planned our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted 

we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions which gives rise to risks and challenges that could adversely affect our future financial results 

we have in the past acquired and we expect to acquire in the future other businesses business units and technologies acquisitions can involve a number of special risks and challenges including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if integration of our acquired businesses is not successful we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects to integrate acquired businesses we must implement our technology systems in the acquired operations and integrate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations we also must effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired business organizations into our own in a way that aligns various interests and may need to enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions 

any of the foregoing and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from our acquired businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of acquisitions 

our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liabilities 

as a result of the sale of our 100 convertible senior notes “100 notes” in june 2006 275 senior notes “275 notes due 2015” and 420 senior notes “420 notes” in september 2010 and 275 senior notes “275 notes due 2017” and 395 senior notes “395 notes” in june 2012 we have notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of 31 billion that mature at specific dates in calendar years 2013 2015 2017 

  

2020 and 2022 in addition we have entered into a credit facility with a borrowing capacity of 1 billion from time to time in the future we may also incur indebtedness in addition to the amount available under our credit facility the maintenance of our debt levels could adversely affect our flexibility to take advantage of certain corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may be required to use all or a substantial portion of our cash balance to repay these notes on maturity unless we can obtain new financing 

adverse global economic events may harm our business operating results and financial condition 

adverse macroeconomic conditions could negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition under a number of different scenarios during challenging economic times and periods of high unemployment current or potential customers may delay or forgo decisions to license new products or additional instances of existing products upgrade their existing hardware or operating environments which upgrades are often a catalyst for new purchases of our software or purchase services customers may also have difficulties in obtaining the requisite thirdparty financing to complete the purchase of our products and services an adverse macroeconomic environment could also subject us to increased credit risk should customers be unable to pay us or delay paying us for previously purchased products and services accordingly reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase in addition weakness in the market for end users of our products could harm the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could then delay paying their obligations to us or experience other financial difficulties this would further increase our credit risk exposure and potentially cause delays in our recognition of revenue on sales to these customers 

in addition the onset or continuation of adverse economic conditions may make it more difficult either to utilize our existing debt capacity or otherwise obtain financing for our operations investing activities including potential acquisitions or financing activities specific economic trends such as declines in the demand for pcs servers and other computing devices or softness in corporate information technology spending could have an even more direct and harmful impact on our business 

our international operations involve risks that could increase our expenses adversely affect our operating results and require increased time and attention of our management 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the us and we have significant operations outside of the us including engineering sales customer support and production we plan to expand our international operations but such expansion is contingent upon our identification of growth opportunities our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a significant portion of our transactions outside of the us are denominated in foreign currencies accordingly our revenues and expenses will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates we expect to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future especially if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales or our operations outside the united states continue to increase 

the level of corporate tax from sales to our nonus customers is generally less than the level of tax from sales to our us customers this benefit is contingent upon existing tax regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits 

our products are complex and operate in a wide variety of environments systems applications and configurations which could result in errors or product failures 

because we offer very complex products undetected errors failures or bugs may occur especially when products are first introduced or when new versions are released our products are often installed and used in largescale computing environments with different operating systems system management software and equipment and networking configurations which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors failures or bugs in our products our customers’ computing environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and nonstandard configurations that make prerelease testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and timeconsuming in addition despite testing by us and others errors failures or bugs may not be found in new products or releases until after commencement of commercial shipments in the past we have discovered software errors failures and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and in some cases have experienced delayed or lost revenues as a result of these errors 

errors failures or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity damage to our brand product returns loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products loss of competitive position or claims by customers or others many of our enduser customers use our products in applications that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other less critical software products in addition if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity or availability occurs in one of our enduser customer’s systems regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions delays or cessation of our product licensing which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating results 

  

if we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology our financial results could be harmed 

most of our software and underlying technology is proprietary we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws however all of these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties third parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise obtain use distribute and sell our proprietary information without authorization 

third parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently by designing around our patents our shrinkwrap license agreements are not signed by licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions furthermore the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the us and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries the unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could adversely affect our ability to access software operating system and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor or cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products to their customers in addition any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in alone or through our alliances with the business software alliance “bsa” or the software  information industry association “siia” could be costly may distract management from daytoday operations and may lead to additional claims against us which could adversely affect our operating results 

in january 2012 we became aware of disclosure of the source code for 2006era versions of certain of our norton and pcanywhere products which we believe was the result of a theft of source code that occurred in 2006 any unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code could result in the loss of future trade secret protection for that source code this could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue operating margins results of operations and cash flows as well as our reputation unauthorized disclosure of our source code also could increase the security risks described under “our software products saas offerings and website may be subject to intentional disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future sales” below 

from time to time we are a party to class action and other lawsuits which typically require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses and which could if not determined favorably negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have been named as a party to class action lawsuits and we may be named in additional litigation the expense of defending such litigation may be costly and divert management’s attention from the daytoday operations of our business which could adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows in addition an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business results of operations and cash flows 

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

from time to time we receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others including claims regarding patents copyrights and trademarks because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that the number of these claims may grow in addition former employers of our former current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers any such claim with or without merit could result in costly litigation and distract management from daytoday operations if we are not successful in defending such claims we could be required to stop selling delay shipments of or redesign our products pay monetary amounts as damages enter into royalty or licensing arrangements or satisfy indemnification 

  

obligations that we have with some of our customers we cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to investigate defend and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

in addition we license and use software from third parties in our business these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and may expose us to additional liability this liability or our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

our software products saas offerings and website may be subject to intentional disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future sales 

despite our precautions and significant ongoing investments to protect against security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and other intentional disruptions of our products and offerings we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance of our products and offerings and harm our reputation as a company similarly experienced computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our website and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an event could adversely affect our competitive position reputation brand and future sales of our products and our customers may assert claims against us related to resulting losses of confidential or proprietary information our business could be subject to significant disruption and we could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm in the event of such incidents and claims 

fluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected the price of our common stock in the past and could affect our stock price in the future 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and which could adversely affect our operations and operating results if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts and investors our stock price could be negatively affected any volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance 

factors associated with our industry the operation of our business and the markets for our products may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 

some of our products contain “open source” software and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business 

certain of our products are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under socalled “open source” licenses which may include by way of example the gnu general public license “gpl” gnu lesser general public license “lgpl” the mozilla public license the bsd license and the apache license some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use by the terms of certain open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner in addition to risks related to license requirements usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third party commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software we have established processes to help alleviate these risks including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products in addition many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated and could if not properly addressed negatively affect our business 

if we are unable to adequately address increased customer demands on our technical support services our relationships with our customers and our financial results may be adversely affected 

we offer technical support services with many of our products we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers further customer demand for these services without corresponding revenues could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results 

  

we have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide consumer support functions to third party service providers if these companies experience financial difficulties do not maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level under these contracts the level of support services to our customers may be significantly disrupted which could materially harm our relationships with these customers 

accounting charges may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results 

our financial results have been in the past and may continue to be in the future materially affected by noncash and other accounting charges including 

 

  

  

  

  

 for example during fiscal 2009 we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 74 billion resulting in a significant net loss for the year goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant as we determined they did in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and our evaluation depends to a large degree on estimates and assumptions made by our management our assessment of any impairment of goodwill is based on a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units to the carrying value of that reporting unit our determination of fair value relies on management’s assumptions of our future revenues operating costs and other relevant factors if management’s estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other key assumptions such as the discount rate applied to future operating results the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units could change significantly which could result in a goodwill impairment charge in addition we evaluate our other longlived assets including intangible assets whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate that the value of these assets might be impaired if we determine that impairment has occurred we could incur an impairment charge against the value of these assets 

the foregoing types of accounting charges may also be incurred in connection with or as a result of other business acquisitions the price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by the foregoing accounting charges 

we sell products to the us government under contracts that include special compliance obligations and subject us to audits and reviews by various agencies of the us government any failure to meet these obligations or an adverse outcome in an audit or investigation could result in civil damages andor penalties being assessed against us by the government 

we have sold products through our us general services administration multiple award schedule contract no gs35f0240t effective january 24 2007 the “gsa schedule contract” our gsa schedule contract contains provisions that require us to provide customers purchasing through that contract with negotiated favorable pricing as compared to certain nonfederal customers and requires us to monitor aspects of our commercial sales practices to ensure compliance with that pricing obligation in the ordinary course of business sales under our gsa schedule contract may be subject to audit andor investigation by the us government noncompliance with the provisions of the contract identified as a result of such reviews as well as noncompliance identified on our own could subject us to damages and other penalties which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

  

on june 4 2012 we were advised by the commercial litigation branch of the department of justice’s civil division and the civil division of the us attorney’s office for the district of columbia that the government is investigating our compliance with certain provisions of our gsa schedule contract including provisions relating to pricing country of origin accessibility and the disclosure of commercial sales practices the department of justice has requested that we preserve among other things all records relating to gsa schedule contracting activity as reported on the gsa’s publiclyavailable database our total sales under the gsa schedule contract were approximately 210 million from the period beginning january 2007 and ending december 2011 

we are cooperating with the investigation and we are unable at this time to predict the likely outcome it is possible that the investigation could lead to claims or findings of violations of the false claims act in connection with our gsa contracting activity violations of the false claims act could result in the imposition of damages including up to treble damages plus civil penalties in some cases to the extent the investigation leads to any such claims or findings the cost to resolve this matter would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition any negative publicity related to our government customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them regardless of the outcome of this matter may also damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees lose key personnel fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully or fail to manage our employee base effectively we may be unable to develop new and enhanced products and services effectively manage or expand our business or increase our revenues 

our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key management technical sales marketing finance and other personnel our officers and other key personnel are employeesatwill and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them competition for people with the specific skills that we require is significant in order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace we believe that we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees in addition we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation plans and accounting rules require us to treat the issuance of equity based compensation as compensation expense as a result we may decide to issue fewer equitybased incentives and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees or conversely if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

from time to time key personnel leave our company while we strive to reduce the negative impact of such changes the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and the results of our operations in addition hiring training and successfully integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time consuming may cause additional disruptions to our operations and may be unsuccessful which could negatively impact future revenues 

our effective tax rate may increase which could increase our income tax expense and reduce increase our net income loss 

our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

 

  

   

  

 the price of our common stock could decline if our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate 

we report our results of operations based on our determination of the aggregate amount of taxes owed in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate from time to time we receive notices that a tax authority in a particular jurisdiction has determined that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority we are regularly engaged in discussions and sometimes disputes with these tax authorities we are engaged in disputes of this nature at this time if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our stock price may be volatile in the future and you could lose the value of your investment 

the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future and as a result you could lose the value of your investment the market price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the stock market in general and the market prices of stocks of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price volatility that has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

our business 

symantec is a global leader in security backup and availability solutions our innovative products and services protect people and information in any digital environment – from the smallest mobile device to the enterprise data center to cloudbased systems our software and services protect against advanced threats independent of the device and environment in which information is used or stored 

fiscal calendar 

we have a 5253week fiscal year ending on the friday closest to march 31 unless otherwise stated references to years in this report relate to fiscal year and periods ended march 29 2013 march 30 2012 and april 1 2011 fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 each consisted of 52 weeks our 2014 fiscal year will consist of 52 weeks and will end on march 28 2014 

strategy 

we are in the midst of a transformation new types of solutions and new market opportunities are emerging as customers look to us to innovate across a digital landscape that has expanded enormously for both consumers and businesses as we think about our markets today it is very clear that the industry needs a new model for protection we are transitioning from being devicecentric which meant protecting endpoints and the data center to having the broader focus of protecting and managing digital information individuals businesses and other organizations use new ways to access their digital information creating new opportunities for us to develop products and services which address mobile devices web services web platforms and the emerging software defined data center and network our strategy is to establish leadership in this evolving informationcentric world by identifying and delivering solutions that solve large unmet or underserved customer needs while building competitive advantage and creating sustainable financial performance 

to successfully implement our strategy we are focusing on three areas developing innovative products and services changing our gotomarket “gtm” strategy and simplifying our organization for information regarding risks associated with our international operations see item 1 business 

financial implications of new strategy 

fiscal 2014 will include significant transitions as we seek to improve our growth capabilities develop our dedicated renewals team refocus our direct field sales representatives on new business eliminate duplicative organization and operating structures and right size the company our income and cash flows are expected to be impacted by severance charges and capital expenditures as we invest in our people processes and technology to execute our organic growth strategy in the next fiscal year 

our operating segments 

our operating segments are significant strategic business units that offer different products and services distinguished by customer needs since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we have operated in five operating segments consumer security and compliance storage and server management services and other as a result of the new strategy we will analyze our operations and organization structure and modify our segment reporting structure as necessary 

  

financial results and trends 

revenue increased by 176 million for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily driven by growth in our security and compliance and storage and server management segments our revenue grew both domestically and internationally in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 for fiscal 2013 we experienced the highest growth in revenue on a percentage basis in the asia pacific and japan region followed by the americas the emea region remained flat despite macroeconomic challenges in the european economy fluctuations in the us dollar compared to foreign currencies unfavorably impacted our international revenue by 141 million for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 

cost of revenue increased by 93 million for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to our initiative to improve customer support resulting in higher technical support costs the increasing costs associated with major oem partners as part of certain revenuesharing arrangements and the additional direct costs associated with our appliance business 

operating expenses remained consistent as a percentage of revenue while we continued to focus on investing in product development and increasing compensation costs due to headcount additions coupled with effectively managing our cost structure we experienced favorable foreign currency effects on our operating expenses of 98 million in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 as we continue to reallocate talent within our organization and are dedicating spending and resources to focus on certain key areas we expect research and development expenses to increase through fiscal 2017 as we invest to drive organic innovation for our customers furthermore we will incur significant restructuring charges as we eliminate duplicative organization and operating structures these restructuring activities are expected to be completed in fiscal 2014 and we expect to incur total severance and benefit costs between 220 million and 250 million 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates including judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly historically our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results however actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions if actual results differ from these estimates and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of income and in certain situations could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 

a critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially impact our operating results or financial condition we believe that the estimates described below represent our critical accounting estimates as they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see also note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue primarily pursuant to the requirements under the authoritative guidance on software revenue recognition and any applicable amendments or modifications revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and require us to make many estimates 

  

for software arrangements that include multiple elements including perpetual software licenses and maintenance or services packaged products with content updates and subscriptions we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” of the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue vsoe of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our standalone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance consumer product content updates managed security services subscriptions and arrangements where vsoe does not exist deferred revenue totaled approximately 40 billion as of march 29 2013 of which 521 million was classified as longterm deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets changes to the elements in a software arrangement the ability to identify vsoe for those elements the fair value of the respective elements and increasing flexibility in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount recognized in the current period and deferred over time 

for arrangements that include both software and nonsoftware elements we allocate revenue to the software deliverables as a group and nonsoftware deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vsoe ii thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” and iii best estimate of the selling price “esp” when we are unable to establish a selling price using vsoe or tpe we use esp to allocate the arrangement fees to the deliverables 

for our consumer products that include content updates we recognize revenue and the associated cost of revenue ratably over the term of the subscription upon sellthrough to endusers as the subscription period commences on the date of sale to the enduser we defer revenue and cost of revenue amounts for unsold product held by our distributors and resellers 

we expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate inventory of consumer packaged products to meet future customer demand which is generally four or six weeks of customer demand based on recent buying trends we ship product to our distributors and resellers at their request and based on valid purchase orders our distributors and resellers base the quantity of orders on their estimates to meet future customer demand which may exceed the expected level of a four or six week supply we offer limited rights of return if the inventory held by our distributors and resellers is below the expected level of a four or six week supply we estimate reserves for product returns as described below we typically offer liberal rights of return if inventory held by our distributors and resellers exceeds the expected level because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of excess inventory that will be returned we primarily offset deferred revenue against trade accounts receivable for the amount of revenue in excess of the expected inventory levels 

arrangements for maintenance subscriptions managed security services and saas offerings are generally offered to our customers over a specified period of time and we recognize the related revenue ratably over the maintenance subscription or service period 

reserves for product returns we reserve for estimated product returns as an offset to revenue or deferred revenue based primarily on historical trends we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels as an offset to deferred revenue actual product returns may be different than what was estimated these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make actual results differ from our return estimates 

reserves for rebates we estimate and record reserves for channel and enduser rebates as an offset to revenue or deferred revenue for consumer products that include content updates rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue or deferred revenue over the term of the subscription our estimated reserves for channel 

  

volume incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and resellers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs which are typically entered into quarterly our reserves for enduser rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the promotional programs actual sales during the promotion the amount of actual redemptions received historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program and the value of the rebate we also consider current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserves for rebates if actual redemptions differ from our estimates material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented 

valuation of goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets 

business combination valuations when we acquire businesses we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies and historical experience these estimates can include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

 these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and if such events occur we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities 

goodwill impairment we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable at the reporting unit level our reporting units are the same as our operating segments a qualitative assessment is first made to determine whether it is necessary to perform quantitative testing this initial assessment includes among others consideration of i past current and projected future earnings and equity ii recent trends and market conditions and iii valuation metrics involving similar companies that are publiclytraded and acquisitions of similar companies if available if this initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that impairment exists a second step is taken involving a comparison between the estimated fair values of our reporting units with their respective carrying amounts including goodwill the methods for estimating operating unit values include asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows and multiples of earnings or revenues if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and a third step is performed to measure the amount of impairment the third step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting units over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets less liabilities if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 

the process of estimating the fair value and carrying value of our reporting units’ equity requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis many assets and liabilities such as accounts receivable and property and equipment are not specifically allocated to an individual reporting unit and therefore we apply 

  

judgment to allocate the assets and liabilities and this allocation affects the carrying value of the respective reporting units similarly we use judgment to allocate goodwill to the reporting units based on relative fair values the use of relative fair values has been necessary for certain reporting units due to changes in our operating structure in prior years to determine a reporting unit’s fair value we use the income approach under which we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit we evaluate the reasonableness of this approach by comparing it with the market approach which involves a review of the carrying value of our assets relative to our market capitalization and to the valuation of publicly traded companies operating in the same or similar lines of business 

applying the income approach requires that we make a number of important estimates and assumptions we estimate the future cash flows of each reporting unit based on historical and forecasted revenue and operating costs this in turn involves further estimates such as estimates of future revenue and expense growth rates in addition we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation this discount rate is based on the estimated weightedaverage cost of capital for each reporting unit and may change from year to year changes in these key estimates and assumptions or in other assumptions used in this process could materially affect our impairment analysis for a given year 

as of march 29 2013 our goodwill balance was 58 billion amongst our reporting units based on a qualitative impairment analysis performed on december 29 2012 we determined that it was more likely than not that there was no impairment in any of our reporting units 

a number of factors many of which we have no ability to control could affect our financial condition operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 intangible asset impairment we assess the impairment of identifiable finitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset group’s carrying amount may not be recoverable recoverability of certain finitelived intangible assets particularly customer relationships and finitelived trade names would be measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset group to which the assets are assigned to the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows the asset group is expected to generate if an asset is considered to be impaired the amount of such impairment would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value recoverability and impairment of other finitelived intangible assets particularly developed technology and patents would be measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of undiscounted estimated future product revenues offset by estimated future costs to dispose of the product to which the asset relates for indefinitelived intangible assets we review impairment on an annual basis consistent with the timing of the annual evaluation for goodwill these assets generally include trade names and trademarks similar to goodwill impairment testing a qualitative assessment is first made to determine whether it is necessary to perform quantitative testing this initial 

  

assessment includes consideration of among other things i past current and projected future revenues ii recent trends and market conditions including discount rates and iv valuation metrics such as royalty rates involving similar companies that are publiclytraded if available if this initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that impairment exists a second step is taken this step involves a comparison between the fair values of the assets and their respective carrying amounts any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value would be recognized as an impairment charge our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted future revenue operating costs and other relevant factors assumptions and estimates about the remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are subjective and are affected by changes to our business strategies if management’s estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other assumptions the estimate of the fair value of our identifiable intangible assets could change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 

longlived assets we assess longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the longlived assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment we assess recoverability of longlived assets based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method using assumptions determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model if an asset is not recoverable impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and its fair value our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors which could change and cause a material impact to our operating results or financial condition we record impairment charges on longlived assets held for sale when we determine that the carrying value of the longlived assets may not be recoverable in determining fair value we obtain and consider market value appraisal information from third parties 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance stockbased compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is generally recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period of the respective award 

determining the fair value of stockbased awards primarily stock options at the grant date requires judgment we use the blackscholesmerton option pricing model “bsm model” to determine the fair value of stock options the determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the options actual and projected employee stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends 

we estimate the expected life of options granted based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and postvesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option expected volatility is based on the average of historical volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of traded options the risk free interest rate is equal to the us treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal to the expected life for all historical periods presented we have not paid cash dividends on our common stock and therefore our expected dividend rate was zero for all such periods presented for information regarding a subsequent event announcing the declaration of a quarterly dividend see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

we issue performancebased restricted stock units ‘‘prus’’ and performancecontingent stock units “pcsus” representing hypothetical shares of our common stock each pru and pcsu grant reflects a target number of shares that may be issued to the award recipient the actual number of prus the recipient receives is determined at the end of a threeyear performance period as follows 1 our achievement of an annual target 

  

earnings per share for the first fiscal year of grant and 2 our two and three year cumulative relative total shareholder return ranked against that of other companies that are included in the standard  poor’s 500 index the pcsus vest based upon the performance of symantec’s common stock over a threeyear period and are also subject to an underlying continued service vesting condition we estimate the fair value of prus using the monte carlo simulation option pricing model “monte carlo model” as the total shareholder return modifier contains a market condition we estimate the fair value and derived service period of pcsus using the monte carlo model as this statistical model can simulate a range of possible future stock prices for symantec 

in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation we record stockbased compensation expense for awards that are expected to vest as a result judgment is required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience actual forfeitures may differ if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted when we record an adjustment for the difference in the period that the awards vest or are forfeited 

contingencies and litigation 

we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on contingencies we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes from potential claims or legal proceedings as well as potential ranges of probable losses when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and reasonably estimable a determination of the amount of accrued liabilities required if any for these contingencies is made after the analysis of each separate matter because of uncertainties related to these matters we base our estimates on the information available at the time of our assessment as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates any revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our operating results and financial position 

income taxes 

we are required to compute our income taxes in each federal state and international jurisdiction in which we operate this process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes the income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as current or longterm deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets our judgments assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income 

our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding indefinitely reinvested earnings outside the united states material changes in our estimates of such earnings or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of such earnings could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate if certain foreign earnings previously treated as indefinitely reinvested outside the united states are repatriated the related us tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings 

we account for uncertain tax positions pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a twostep approach to recognize and measure those positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax 

  

benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the refinement of estimates or the realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statements of income in the period in which such determination is made 

we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and based on this assessment establish a valuation allowance if required the determination of our valuation allowance involves assumptions judgments and estimates including forecasted earnings future taxable income and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our consolidated statements of income

in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 we issued 600 million in principal amount of 275 interestbearing senior notes due june 2017 and 400 million in principal amount of 395 interestbearing senior notes due june 2022 which resulted in interest expense of 26 million in fiscal 2013 other income expense net increased due to a tax incentive received from the china tax bureau in the form of valueadded tax refunds of 33 million see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional information

provision for income taxes 

 

 our effective tax rate was approximately 25 20 and 15 in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

the tax expense in fiscal 2013 was reduced by the following benefits 1 17 million tax benefits arising from the veritas 2002 through 2005 irs appeals matters including adjustments to state liabilities and a reduction of interest accrued 2 13 million in tax benefits resulting from tax settlements and adjustments to prior year items 3 10 million from lapses of statutes of limitation and 4 2 million for the benefit of the 

  

research credit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 resulting from the extension of the federal research credit as part of the 2012 taxpayer relief act these tax benefits were offset by a 9 million tax expense from an increase in valuation allowance on state research tax credits 

the tax expense in fiscal 2012 was reduced by the following benefits 1 52 million tax benefit arising from the veritas 2002 through 2005 irs appeals matters 2 14 million from lapses of statutes of limitation 3 17 million from the settlements and effective settlements with tax authorities and related remeasurements and 4 5 million tax benefit from adjustments related to prior year items this benefit was partially offset by a 5 million tax expense resulting from a change in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets 

the tax expense in fiscal 2011 was reduced by the following benefits 1 49 million arising from the veritas v commissioner tax court decision further discussed below 2 15 million from the reduction of our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and 3 21 million tax benefit from lapses of statutes of limitation and 4 7 million tax benefit from the conclusion of us and foreign audits 

the effective tax rate for all periods presented otherwise reflects the benefits of lowertaxed international earnings and losses from our joint venture with huawei technologies co limited domestic manufacturing incentives and research and development credits partially offset by state income taxes pretax income from international operations was significantly higher in fiscal 2012 due to the sale of our 49 ownership interest in the joint venture to huawei on march 30 2012 for 526 million a significant portion of the sale proceeds was attributable to international tax jurisdictions resulting in a 20 tax rate on the sale of the joint venture reducing the overall tax rate in fiscal 2012 by 3 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and international tax jurisdictions a substantial portion of our international earnings were generated from subsidiaries organized in ireland and singapore our results of operations would be adversely affected to the extent that our geographical mix of income becomes more weighted toward jurisdictions with higher tax rates and would be favorably affected to the extent the relative geographic mix shifts to lower tax jurisdictions any change in our mix of earnings is dependent upon many factors and is therefore difficult to predict 

for further information on the impact of foreign earnings on our effective tax rate see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

see critical accounting estimates above for additional information about our provision for income taxes 

in assessing the ability to realize our deferred tax assets we considered whether it was more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we considered the following we have historical cumulative book income as measured by the current and prior two years we have strong consistent taxpaying history we have substantial us federal income tax carryback potential and we have substantial amounts of scheduled future reversals of taxable temporary differences from our deferred tax liabilities levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in part i item 1a risk factors set forth in this annual report we have concluded that this positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence and thus that the deferred tax assets as of march 29 2013 of 402 million after application of the valuation allowances described above are realizable on a “more likely than not” basis 

on december 10 2009 the us tax court issued its opinion in veritas v commissioner finding that our transfer pricing methodology with appropriate adjustments was the best method for assessing the value of the transaction at issue between veritas and its international subsidiary in the 2000 to 2001 tax years in june 2010 we reached an agreement with the irs concerning the amount of the adjustment based on the us tax court decision as a result of the agreement we reduced our liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting in a 39 million tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 in march 2011 we reached agreement with irish 

  

revenue concerning compensating adjustments arising from this matter resulting in an additional 10 million tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 this matter has now been closed and no further adjustments to the accrued liability are expected 

on december 2 2009 we received a revenue agent’s report from the irs for the veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years assessing additional taxes due we contested 80 million of the tax assessed and all penalties as a result of negotiations with irs appeals in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we remeasured our liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting in a tax benefit of 52 million we executed the final closing agreement for the veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years on december 26 2012 accordingly we recorded a further tax benefit of 3 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 based on the closing agreement further we amended our state tax returns for the veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 to reflect the adjustments in the closing agreement and remeasured our state liability resulting in a benefit of 7 million 

the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain and the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year although potential resolution of uncertain tax positions involve multiple tax periods and jurisdictions it is reasonably possible that the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to these audits could decrease whether by payment release or a combination of both in the next 12 months by between 15 million and 130 million depending on the nature of the settlement or expiration of statutes of limitations we estimate at least 15 million could affect our income tax provision and therefore benefit the resulting effective tax rate as of march 29 2013 we have 76 million on deposit with the irs pertaining to us tax matters in the symantec 2005 through 2008 audit cycle 

we continue to monitor the progress of ongoing tax controversies and the impact if any of the expected tolling of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions 

noncontrolling interest 

in fiscal 2011 we completed the acquisition of the identity and authentication business of verisign including a controlling interest in its subsidiary verisign japan kk “verisign japan” a publicly traded company on the tokyo stock exchange given our majority ownership interest of 54 in verisign japan the accounts of verisign japan have been consolidated with our accounts and a noncontrolling interest has been recorded for the noncontrolling investors’ interests in the equity and operations of verisign japan during the second quarter of fiscal 2013 we completed a tender offer and paid 92 million to acquire verisign japan common shares and stock rights which increased our ownership percentage to 92 during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we acquired the remaining 8 interest for 19 million and verisign japan became a whollyowned subsidiary the payment was made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional information for fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 the loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest in verisign japan was approximately 0 million 0 million and 4 million respectively

in december 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued an accounting standards update that will require us to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements associated with 

  

certain financial and derivative instruments to enable users of our financial statements to better understand the effect of those arrangements on our financial position in january 2013 the fasb issued another update to clarify the scope of the related instruments in which the standard applies to bifurcated embedded derivatives repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending transactions the new guidance will be applicable to us on a retrospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we do not expect that this guidance will materially impact our disclosures included in our consolidated financial statements 

in january 2013 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that will require us to release cumulative translation adjustment “cta” into earnings when an entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets within a consolidated foreign entity and the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity for sales of an equity method investment in a foreign entity a pro rata portion of cta attributable to the equity method investment would be recognized in earnings upon sale of the investment when a parent entity sells either a part or all of its investment in a consolidated foreign entity cta would be recognized in earnings only if the parent no longer has a controlling financial interest in the foreign entity as a result of the sale in addition cta would be recognized in earnings upon a business combination achieved in stages the update will be effective on a prospective basis for events beginning in our 2015 fiscal year and applies to all interim periods we do not expect that this guidance will materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2013 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that requires entities to present reclassifications by component when reporting changes in accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” balances for significant items reclassified out of aoci to net income in their entirety entities are required to report the effect on the line items in the income statement either on the face of the income statement or in the notes for significant items not reclassified to net income in their entirety entities must crossreference in the notes to the other disclosures that already provide information about those amounts this new guidance will be adopted in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 on a prospective basis we do not expect that this guidance will materially impact our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices we may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies we do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

as of march 29 2013 we had 210 billion in principal amount of fixedrate senior notes outstanding with a carrying amount of 210 billion and a fair value of 219 billion which fair value is based on level 2 inputs of market prices for similar debt instruments and resulting yields we have performed sensitivity analyses as of march 29 2013 by using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 50 bps movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant on march 29 2013 a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixedrate senior notes by a decrease of approximately 57 million and an increase of approximately 59 million respectively however this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we conduct business in 32 currencies through our worldwide operations and as such we are exposed to foreign currency risk foreign currency risks are associated with our cash and cash equivalents investments receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies our exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses is the result of certain net receivables due from our foreign subsidiaries and customers being denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary primarily the euro and singapore dollar our foreign subsidiaries conduct their businesses in local currency we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts with up to six months in duration to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the subsidiary we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates for all currencies could be experienced the estimated impacts of a five or ten percent appreciation or depreciation in value are as follows 

 

 we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of the changes in foreign exchange rates 

equity price risk 

in june 2006 we issued 10 billion principal amount of 100 notes due june 2013 the 100 notes have a fixed annual interest rate and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the convertible senior notes however the fair value will increase as interest rates fall andor our common stock price increases and decrease as interest rates rise andor our common stock price decreases the interest and market value changes affect the fair value of the 100 notes but do not impact our financial position cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations the carrying value of the 100 notes was 997 million as of march 29 2013 which represents the liability component of the 10 billion principal balance the total estimated fair value of our 100 notes at march 29 2013 was 129 billion and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price of 129 per 100 of the 100 notes as of that date see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report

 item 1 business 

overview 

we are a wholesale generator with approximately 23700 mw of net electric generating capacity located in many cases near major metropolitan load centers in the pjm miso northeast and southeast regions and california we also operate integrated asset management and proprietary trading operations our customers are principally isos rtos and investorowned utilities although our generating portfolio is diversified across fossil fuel and technology types operating characteristics and several regional power markets approximately 42 and 37 of our realized gross margin during 2011 was attributable to our eastern pjm and western pjmmiso operating segments respectively in addition during 2011 approximately 51 of our realized gross margin was attributable to contracted and capacity energy services 

our generating capacity is 57 in pjm 23 in caiso 11 in nyiso and isone 8 in the southeast and 1 in miso the net generating capacity of these facilities consists of approximately 39 baseload 40 intermediate and 21 peaking capacity our coal facilities generally dispatch as baseload capacity although some dispatch as intermediate capacity and our gas oil and dual fuel plants primarily dispatch as intermediate andor peaking capacity 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities under a variety of statutes regulations and permits that address discharges into the air water and soil and the proper handling of solid hazardous and toxic materials and waste complying with increasingly stringent environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating expenses to the extent forecasted returns on investments necessary to comply with environmental regulations are insufficient for a particular facility we plan to deactivate that facility in determining the forecasted returns on investments we factor in forecasted energy and capacity prices expected capital expenditures operating costs property taxes and other factors we currently expect to deactivate the following generating capacity primarily coalfired units in the referenced years niles 217 mw 2012 elrama 460 mw mothball 2012 and retire in 2014 new castle 330 mw 2015 titus 243 mw 2015 portland 401 mw 2015 shawville 597 mw place in longterm protective layup in 2015 and glen gardner 160 mw 2015 further although our evaluation of the viability of environmental controls for our avon lake facility 732 mw is continuing our initial analysis indicates that forecasted returns on such investments are insufficient if such analysis is confirmed we anticipate retiring the coalfired units at the avon lake facility in 2015 the decision with respect to avon lake is influenced in part by retirement decisions announced by other companies that we are continuing to evaluate in light of the expected retirement or longterm protective layup of the referenced facilities we do not expect such facilities to participate in pjms upcoming base residual auction for 20152016 in may 2012 we expect industry retirements of coalfired generating facilities to contribute to a tightening of supply and demand fundamentals and higher prices for the remaining generating facilities consequently we expect the resulting higher market prices to provide adequate returns on investment in environmental controls necessary to meet promulgated and anticipated requirements accordingly we expect to invest approximately 586 million to 726 million over the next ten years for scrs and other major environmental controls for further discussion see —regulatory environment—environmental regulation below and item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—environmental matters 

merger 

on december 3 2010 mirant and rri energy completed their merger mirant merged with a whollyowned subsidiary of rri energy with mirant surviving the merger as a whollyowned subsidiary of rri energy in connection with the allstock taxfree merger rri energy changed its name to 

genon energy inc mirant stockholders received a fixed ratio of 2835 shares of genon common stock for each share of mirant common stock and mirant changed its name to genon energy holdings 

although rri energy was the legal acquirer the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition and mirant was deemed to have acquired rri energy for accounting purposes as a consequence of the reverse acquisition accounting treatment the historical financial statements presented for periods prior to the merger date and any other financial or operational information presented herein with respect to premerger dates unless otherwise specified are the historical statements and information of mirant except for stockholders equity which has been retroactively adjusted for the equivalent number of shares of the legal acquirer the operations of the former rri energy businesses have been included in the financial statements from the date of the merger thus the consolidated financial statements and financial and operational results of genon include the results of mirant through december 2 2010 and include the results of the combined entities from december 3 2010 unless indicated otherwise 

strategy 

our goal is to create longterm stockholder value across a broad range of commodity price environments we intend to achieve this goal by 

successfully integrating the companies and achieving annual cost savings targets in connection with the merger we announced an initial annual cost savings target of 150 million through reductions in corporate overhead and support costs we have achieved 160 million in such annual cost savings see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 for further information on our cost savings and mergerrelated costs 

leveraging operating and commercial expertise we have substantial experience in the management operation and optimization of a portfolio of diverse generating facilities we operate our generating facilities safely efficiently and in an environmentally responsible manner to achieve optimal availability and performance to maximize cash flow 

transacting to reduce variability in realized gross margin we develop and execute appropriate hedging strategies to manage risks associated with the volatility in the price at which we sell power and in the prices of fuel emissions allowances and other inputs required to produce such power this includes hedging over multiple years to reduce the variability in realized gross margin from our expected generation in addition we will continue to sell capacity either bilaterally or through periodic auction processes which provides a predictable and relatively stable stream of realized gross margin and cash flow 

maintaining appropriate liquidity and capital structure through disciplined balance sheet management and maintaining adequate liquidity we expect to be able to operate across a broad range of commodity price environments at december 31 2011 we had approximately 22 billion in total available cash cash equivalents and availability under our credit facilities see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources in item 7 for information on our liquidity 

investing capital prudently our capital investment decisions are focused on achieving an appropriate return for our stockholders capital investments are evaluated independently and include 

• participating in the development or acquisition of new facilities such as our investment in the marsh landing generating facility • maintaining our existing generating facilities for near and longterm availability and 2 

• investing in our existing facilities to improve their competitive position including capital investments for environmental controls business segments 

we have five operating segments eastern pjm western pjmmiso california energy marketing and other operations the table below summarizes selected financial information for our operations by business segment for 2011 



1 gross margin excludes depreciation and amortization 2 for 2011 we recorded 23 billion in revenues from a single counterparty pjm which represented 62 of our consolidated revenues the revenues generated from this counterparty are included in our eastern pjm western pjmmiso and energy marketing segments 

for selected financial information about our business segments see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements 

eastern pjm segment 

we own or lease eight generating facilities in the eastern pjm segment with total net generating capacity of 6341 mw the following table presents the details of our eastern pjm generating facilities 



1 total mw amounts reflect net summer capacity 2 represents the year of commercial operation or range of years if units became operational in different years 3 dual means natural gas and oil

in january 2011 stone  webster the epc contractor for the scrubber projects at the chalk point dickerson and morgantown generating facilities filed three suits against us in the united states district court for the district of maryland the maryland cases have been stayed pending resolution of a related action we filed against stone  webster in new york see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

in august 2011 we entered into an agreement with the city of alexandria virginia to remove permanently from service our potomac river generating facility on october 1 2012 subject to the receipt of all necessary consents and approvals we do not expect the closing of the potomac river generating facility to have a material effect on our business results of operations financial position or cash flows see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

we recently completed an analysis of the cost of environmental controls required for the glen gardner facility to comply with the new jersey high electric demand day regulations after evaluation of forecasted energy and capacity prices expected capital expenditures operating costs property taxes and other factors we concluded that the forecasted returns on investment necessary to comply with these regulations are insufficient we anticipate that we will retire the glen gardner facility in may 2015 

we have three fly ash facilities in maryland faulkner westland and brandywine the mde has sued us regarding faulkner and brandywine and threatened to sue regarding westland see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

western pjmmiso segment 

we own or lease 23 generating facilities in the western pjmmiso segment with total net generating capacity of 7483 mw the following table presents the details of our western pjmmiso generating facilities 



1 total mw amounts reflect net summer capacity 2 represents the year of commercial operation or range of years if units became operational in different years 3 dual means natural gas and oil 4 so 2 controls include fgd and cfbfda circulating fluidized bed boiler with flash dry absorber no x controls include scr and sncr in addition substantially all of our coal units and many of our other units are equipped with combustion controls to reduce no x ie low no x burners overfire air systems andor water injection 5 b is baseload i is intermediate p is peaking 6 if our initial analysis is confirmed we anticipate retiring the coalfired units at the avon lake generating facility in april 2015 7 for avon lake unit 9 8 we lease 100 1667 and 1645 interests in three pennsylvania facilities shawville keystone and conemaugh respectively through facility lease agreements expiring in 2026 2034 and 2034 respectively we operate the shawville keystone and conemaugh facilities the table includes our net share of the capacity of these facilities 9 we expect to mothball the elrama generating facility 460 mw in june 2012 and retire it in march 2014 10 ccgt means combined cycle gas turbine 11 we expect to retire the new castle generating facility 330 mw in april 2015 12 we expect to retire the coalfired units at the niles generating facility 217 mw of the 242 mw in june 2012 

13 for niles unit 1 14 we expect to retire the coalfired units at the portland generating facility 401 mw of the 570 mw in january 2015 15 we expect to place the coalfired units at the shawville generating facility 597 mw of the 603 mw in longterm protective layup in april 2015 16 we expect to retire the coalfired units at the titus generating facility 243 mw of the 274 mw in april 2015 

the avon lake new castle and niles generating facilities moved from the miso region to the pjm region in june 2011 as a result of the fercs approval of the transmission owners request to transfer the operation of its assets from miso into pjm 

in november 2011 the epa published a final rule that will require us to reduce our maximum allowable so 2 emissions from two coal units at our portland generating facility beginning in january 2013 with even greater reductions in january 2015 we have challenged this rule in federal court see environmental regulation and note 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

we recently completed an analysis of the sufficiency of returns on investing in environmental controls required for the units at the niles elrama new castle titus portland and shawville facilities these controls will be required primarily as a result of mats after evaluation of forecasted energy and capacity prices expected capital expenditures operating costs property taxes and other factors we concluded that the forecasted returns on investments necessary to comply with environmental regulations are insufficient we currently expect to retire the units at the referenced facilities as set forth below 

• niles in june 2012 • elrama in march 2014 • new castle in april 2015 • titus in april 2015 and • portland in january 2015 in addition we plan to mothball the elrama facility in june 2012 and place the coalfired units at the shawville facility which is leased in a longterm protective layup in april 2015 see managements discussion and analysis—liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our obligations under the lease for the shawville generating facility 

further although our evaluation of environmental controls for the avon lake facility is continuing our initial analysis indicates that such investments are not justified and if such analysis is confirmed we anticipate retiring the avon lake facility in april 2015 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—environmental matters for a discussion of expected investments in major environmental controls and the increase in such costs in the event that we conclude that the investment for environmental controls for the avon lake facility is justified 

in light of the expected retirement or longterm protective layup of the referenced facilities we do not expect such facilities to participate in pjms upcoming base residual auction for 20152016 in may 2012 

california segment 

we own seven generating facilities in california with total net generating capacity of 5391 mw in addition our marsh landing project is included in the california segment the following table presents the details of our current california generating facilities 



1 total mw amounts reflect net summer capacity 2 represents the year of commercial operation or range of years if units became operational in different years 3 i is intermediate p is peaking 4 we expect to retire the contra costa generating facility in may 2013 

our existing generating facilities in california depend almost entirely on payments they receive to operate in support of system and local reliability through the sale of resource adequacy capacity to load serving entities the energy capacity and ancillary services markets as currently constituted will not support the capital expenditures necessary to repower or reconstruct our facilities in order to justify repowering or reconstructing our facilities we would need to obtain contracts with creditworthy buyers absent that our existing generating facilities in california will be commercially viable only as long as they have contracts for their capacity see commercial operations for further discussion 

we have entered into agreements with pge to provide electricity from our natural gasfired units in service at contra costa and pittsburg we entered into an agreement with pge in september 2009 for 674 mw at contra costa for the period from november 2011 through april 2013 at the end of the agreement and subject to any necessary regulatory approvals we have agreed to retire the contra costa facility in addition we entered into an agreement with pge in october 2010 for 1159 mw at pittsburg for three years commencing january 2011 with options for pge to extend the agreement for each of 2014 and 2015 under the respective agreements we will receive monthly capacity payments with bonuses andor penalties based on heat rate and availability 

in september 2009 genon marsh landing entered into a tenyear ppa with pge for 760 mw of natural gasfired peaking generation to be constructed adjacent to our contra costa generating facility near antioch california during the tenyear term of the ppa genon marsh landing will receive fixed monthly capacity payments and variable operating payments the contract provides pge with the entire output of the generating facility which is expected to be capable of producing 719 mw during peak summer conditions 

in may 2010 genon marsh landing entered into an epc agreement with kiewit for the construction of the marsh landing generating facility under the epc agreement kiewit is to design and construct the marsh landing generating facility on a turnkey basis including all engineering procurement construction commissioning training startup and testing the lump sum cost of the epc agreement is 505 million including the 212 million total cost under the siemens turbine generator supply and services agreement which was assigned to kiewit in connection with the 

execution of the epc agreement plus the reimbursement of california sales and use taxes see debt obligations offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations in liquidity and capital resources and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements 

in october 2010 genon marsh landing entered into a credit agreement for up to 650 million of commitments to finance the marsh landing generating facility see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements 

genon marsh landing received all permits necessary to begin construction and in october 2010 directed kiewit to commence engineering and procurement for and construction of the marsh landing generating facility construction of the marsh landing generating facility is expected to be completed by mid2013 

in january 2011 at our request the ferc approved changes to the rmr agreement for our potrero facility in san francisco california to allow the caiso to terminate the rmr agreement effective february 2011 in february 2011 the potrero facility was shut down in compliance with our november 2009 settlement agreement with the city and county of san francisco 

energy marketing segment 

in the markets in which we operate we support our operations with fuel oil management and natural gas transportation and storage activities as well as engage in proprietary trading when we identify opportunities these activities include the purchase and sale of electricity fuel and emissions allowances sometimes through financial derivatives 

we engage in fuel oil management activities to hedge economically the fair value of our physical fuel oil inventories optimize the approximately two million barrels of storage capacity that we own as well as attempt to profit from market opportunities related to timing andor differences in the pricing of various products we engage in natural gas transportation and storage activities to optimize our physical natural gas and storage positions and manage the physical gas requirements for a portion of our assets 

proprietary trading fuel oil management and natural gas transportation and storage activities together typically comprise less than 5 of our realized gross margin all of these activities are governed by a comprehensive risk management policy which includes limits on the size of volumetric positions and var for our proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities and requires all incremental natural gas transportation and natural gas storage activities to be risk reducing for 2011 our combined average daily var for proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities was 2 million 

other operations segment 

our other operations segment is comprised of our generating facilities located in florida massachusetts mississippi new york and texas with total net generating capacity of 4482 mw the following table presents the details of our other operations generating facilities 



1 total mw amounts reflect net summer capacity 2 represents the year of commercial operation or range of years if units became operational in different years 3 dual means natural gas and oil 4 b is baseload i is intermediate p is peaking 5 the indian river generating facility was sold in january 2012 therefore its megawatts are excluded from total net generating capacity 6 the kendall generating facility which is a cogeneration facility has longterm agreements under which it sells steam 7 we own a 50 equity interest in the sabine facility located in east texas having a net generating capacity of 108 mw an unaffiliated party owns the other 50 and an affiliated party to the other owner operates the facility the table includes our net share of the capacity of this facility 8 we are party to a tolling agreement that expires in may 2012 and entitles us to purchase and dispatch 100 of this facilitys electric generating capacity the tolling agreement is treated as an operating lease for accounting purposes 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 we identified potential risks associated with some equipment that reduced the available capacity of one of the units at the bowline generating facility we are in the process of evaluating longterm solutions for the generating facility but we expect that the reduction in available capacity will extend through 2014 unrelated to the reduction in available capacity we are repairing the facilitys transmission and gas supply lines which were damaged by hurricane irene in august 2011 until these repairs are completed the facility cannot be dispatched we expect to complete these repairs in may 2012 

commercial operations 

we provide energy capacity ancillary and other energy services to wholesale customers in competitive energy markets in the united states including isos and rtos power aggregators retail providers electriccooperatives other power generating companies and other load serving entities our commercial operations consist primarily of dispatching electricity hedging the price of electricity we expect to generate selling capacity procuring and managing fuel and providing logistical support for the operation of our facilities for example by procuring transportation for coal and natural gas as well as our proprietary trading operations 

we sell capacity either bilaterally or through periodic auction processes in each iso and rto market in which we participate our capacity sales primarily occur through the pjm rpm and isone fcm auctions but also in caiso miso nyiso and other markets where we enter into agreements with counterparties we expect that a substantial portion of our pjm capacity will continue to be sold in pjm up to three years in advance revenue from these capacity sales is determined by market rules designed to ensure regional reliability encourage competition and reduce energy price volatility these capacity sales provide an important source of predictable revenues for us over the contracted periods at january 24 2012 total projected contracted capacity and ppa revenues for which prices have been set for 2012 through 2015 are 30 billion failure to meet our capacity commitments may result in a reduction to our capacity payments through penalties or charges 

as a part of our strategy we enter into economic hedges—forward sales of electricity and forward purchases of fuel and emissions allowances—to manage the risks associated with volatility in prices for electricity fuel and emissions allowances and to achieve more predictable financial results in addition given the high correlation between natural gas prices and electricity prices in many of the markets in which we operate we enter into forward sales of natural gas to hedge economically our exposure to changes in the price of electricity we procure our hedges in otc transactions or on exchanges where electricity fuel and emissions allowances are broadly traded or through specific transactions with buyers and sellers using futures forwards swaps and options our hedges cover various periods including several years 

see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this form 10k for our aggregate hedge levels based on expected generation for 2012 to 2016 in addition see item 1a risk factors—risks related to economic and financial market conditions for a discussion of the risks associated with implementation of the doddfrank act on our ability to hedge economically our generation including potentially reducing liquidity in the energy and commodity markets and if we are required to clear such transactions on exchanges or meet other requirements by significantly increasing the collateral costs associated with such activities 

power 

we hedge economically a substantial portion of our pjm coalfired baseload generation and certain of our other generation we generally do not hedge our intermediate and peaking units for tenors greater than 12 months a significant portion of our hedges are financial swap transactions between genon midatlantic and financial counterparties that are senior unsecured obligations of such parties and do not require either party to post cash collateral either for initial margin or for securing exposure as a result of changes in power or natural gas prices 

although standard industry otc transactions make up a substantial portion of our economic hedge portfolio at times we sell nonstandard structured products to customers primarily financial institutions these products include fixed load shapes load following arrangements heat rate options and financial or physical tolls 

several of our california florida and mississippi generating facilities typically operate under contracts for their capacity or energy see business—business segments—california segment for information regarding california contracts 

fuel 

we enter into contracts of varying terms to secure appropriate quantities of fuel that meet the varying specifications of our generating facilities for our coalfired generating facilities we purchase most of our coal from a small number of suppliers under contracts with terms of varying lengths some of which extend to 2014 and one that extends to 2020 see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a of this form 10k for discussion of our coal agreement risk for our oilfired units we typically purchase fuel from a small number of suppliers either in the spot market or under contracts with terms of varying lengths for our natural gasfired facilities in addition to purchasing natural gas we arrange for and schedule its transportation through pipelines to perform a portion of these functions we lease natural gas transportation and storage capacity we sell excess fuel supplies to third parties 

we receive coal at our generating facilities primarily by rail and truck in addition we can receive coal by barge at our morgantown cheswick and elrama plants we use coal blending facilities at our conemaugh morgantown and titus generating facilities that allow for greater flexibility of coal supply by allowing various coal qualities to be blended while also meeting emissions targets we monitor coal supply and delivery logistics carefully but there are occasional interruptions of planned deliveries caused by weather operational or transportation issues because of the risk of disruptions in our coal supply we strive to maintain adequate targeted levels of coal inventories at our coalfired facilities

our commercial operations manage the acquisition and use of emissions allowances for our generating facilities we trade emissions allowances for so 2  no x and co 2 and manage the risk surrounding emissions exposure in federal state and regional compliance programs applicable to our generating facilities because of our investments in environmental controls made over the past 12 years to our existing generation fleet that we expect to remain after the deactivations our no x emissions have been reduced by approximately 78 and so 2 emissions have been reduced by approximately 90 from the 1990 levels see —regulatory environment—environmental regulation for a discussion of major environmental controls investments we expect to make over the next ten years 

coal combustion byproducts 

existing state and federal rules require the proper management and disposal of wastes and other materials we produce byproducts from our coalfired generating units including ash and gypsum we actively manage the current and planned disposition of each of these byproducts all of our ash disposal facilities are dry landfills although we do use ponds to dewater ash at some facilities our disposal plan for ash includes landfilling at our existing ash management facilities purchasing and permitting additional disposal sites using third parties to handle and dispose of the ash and construction of an ash beneficiation facility at our morgantown site to make the ash more suitable for sale to third parties for the production of concrete as well as other beneficial uses we have constructed the ash beneficiation facility and expect the facility to begin commercial operations during the first half of 2012 our disposal plan for gypsum includes selling it to third parties for use in the production of drywall and disposing of it in approved landfills currently we expect to invest approximately 40 million in capital expenditures over the next five years for ash landfill modifications and expansions 

there is increased focus on the regulation of coal combustion products and if the manner in which they are regulated changes we may be required to change our management practices for these byproducts andor incur additional costs see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding litigation and other contingencies with respect to our maryland fly ash facilities 

the doddfrank act 

the doddfrank act which was enacted in july 2010 increases the regulation of transactions involving otc derivative financial instruments the statute provides that standardized swap transactions between dealers and large market participants will have to be cleared and traded on an exchange or electronic platform although the provisions and legislative history of the doddfrank act provide strong evidence that market participants such as us which utilize otc derivative financial instruments to hedge commercial risks are not to be subject to these clearing and exchangetrading requirements it is uncertain what the final implementing regulations will provide the effect of the doddfrank act on our business depends in large measure on pending rulemaking proceedings of the cftc the sec and the federal banking regulators under the doddfrank act entities defined as swap dealers and major swap participants sdmsps will face costly requirements for clearing and posting margin as well as additional requirements for reporting and business conduct the cftc and sec issued a proposed rulemaking to set final definitions for the terms swap dealer and major swap participant among others although we do not expect our commercial activity to result in our designation as an sdmsp as proposed the swap dealer definition in particular is ambiguous subjective and could be broad enough to encompass some energy companies it is possible that the final rule will not offer much clarity and the designation as an sdmsp could be decided by facts and circumstance tests we expect the final rule to be released in the first quarter of 2012 

in addition the cftc and federal banking regulators who will regulate bank sdmsps separately issued proposed rules to establish capital and margin requirements for sdmsps and swap counterparties while enduser counterparties who are using a swap to hedge or mitigate commercial risk would be generally exempt from mandatory margin requirements under the cftcs proposal applicable to nonbank sdmsps they would have to post cash margin to bank sdmsps if they exceed exposure thresholds under the federal banking regulators proposal the federal banking regulators rulemaking states that the credit support limit shall be determined by the bank sdmsps in accordance with their normal credit processes to set credit limits and to collect initial and variation margin as proposed the federal banking regulators rulemaking does not specify a procedure for determining such thresholds and a major question remains of the extent to which endusers and bank sdmsps will be free under the proposal to set their own thresholds to avoid the collection of margin from endusers if applied to our hedging activity such regulations could materially affect our ability to hedge economically our generation by significantly increasing the collateral costs associated with such activities furthermore the cftc and federal banking regulators proposed capital requirements for sdmsps recommend significant and cashdependent capital requirements for sdmsps the cost of complying with these requirements may be passed through to and imposed on commercial end users indirectly and increase the cost of our hedging activities 

the cftc has also issued its proposed definition of swap in further defining the term the cftc has left some ambiguity as to whether what are commonly understood as commodity options which can settle physically are to be generally considered swaps with regard to electric power isorto products including financial transmission rights the cftc has said only that it will consider granting exemptions to transactions where an instrument regulated by ferc is involved and such an exclusion would be in the public interest several isos including pjm caiso isone and the nyiso have recently filed the exemption application with the cftc if applied to our hedging activity such regulations could considerably increase the transaction costs with respect to commodity options and financial transmission rights 

in september 2011 the cftc proposed swaps compliance and implementation schedules for mandatory clearing and trading trading documentation and uncleared margin the cftcs notice of proposed rulemaking would give the cftc discretion to phase in implementation of any clearing mandate for 90 180 or 270 days depending on the types of entities that are party to the relevant swap the trigger for the implementation phasein period would be the issuance of a clearing mandate by the cftc the 

cftc also issued a further notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to margin and documentation requirements that would establish implementation schedules of 90 180 or 270 days depending on the types of entities involved the cftc has proposed but not yet adopted regulations implementing both of these provisions as the entity and product definitions have not been finalized we cannot fully assess the impact on us of these proposals 

lastly in october 2011 the cftc adopted final rules on speculative position limits that will apply to 28 futures contracts and any economically equivalent futures options and swaps the rules also establish new reporting requirements for persons holding or controlling positions in certain referenced contracts in excess of particular limits and amend the scope of the bona fide hedging exemption at this time we do not expect the position limits to have a material effect on our commercial activities 

competitive environment 

the power generating industry is capital intensive and highly competitive in addition the wholesale power generation industry is highly fragmented compared to other commodity industries there is wide variation in terms of the capabilities resources nature and identity of the companies with which we compete our competitors include regulated utilities merchant energy companies financial institutions and other companies for a discussion of competitive factors see item 1a risk factors coalfired natural gasfired nuclear and hydroelectric generation currently account for approximately 43 25 19 and 8 respectively of the electricity produced in the united states other energy sources account for the remaining 5 of electricity produced 

our large coal generating fleet is exposed to the relationship between the cost of production and the price of the power produced this relationship commonly referred to as the dark spread fluctuates with the cost of coal and the price of power we hedge economically a substantial portion of our pjm coalfired baseload generation and certain of our other generation we seek to hedge economically our output at varying levels several years in advance because the price of electricity is volatile in addition we enter into contracts to hedge economically our future needs of coal which is our primary fuel the prices for power and natural gas are low compared to several years ago the energy gross margin from our generating facilities is negatively affected by these price levels for that portion of the volumes of generation that we have hedged we are generally economically neutral to subsequent changes in commodity prices because our realized gross margin will reflect the contractual prices of our power and fuel contracts we continue to seek to add economic hedges to maintain projected levels of cash flows from operations for future periods and to help support continued compliance with the covenants in our debt and lease agreements 

given the substantial time required to permit and construct new power plants the process to add generating capacity must begin years in advance of anticipated growth in demand a number of isos and rtos including those in markets in which we operate have implemented capacity markets designed to provide forward prices for capacity that ensure that adequate resources are in place to meet the regions demand over the last several years very little new generation has been constructed as a result of the economic downturn and programs to reduce the demand for electricity which have resulted in a decrease in the rate at which the longterm demand for electricity is forecasted to grow see regulatory environment later in this section for further discussion 

the costs to construct new generating facilities have been rising and there is substantial environmental opposition to building either coalfired or nuclear plants we have sufficient room and infrastructure at many of our existing sites to increase significantly our generating capacity when market rules prices and conditions warrant in addition to reduced costs for developing new generation at existing sites because of our ownership of the land and our ownership of andor access to infrastructure regulators frequently prefer that new generation be added at existing sites brownfield 

development rather than at new sites greenfield development we continue to consider these and other investment opportunities 

many of our generating facilities are located in or near metropolitan areas including boston new york city pittsburgh san francisco southern californialos angeles and washington dc the supplydemand balance in some of these markets is forecasted to become constrained and increasingly dependent on power imported from other regions to sustain reliability however there are proposed upgrades to the transmission systems in some of the markets in which we operate that could mitigate the need for existing marginal generating capacity and for new generating capacity additionally new facilities have been proposed or developed in some of these markets that will increase or have increased available sources of supply to the extent that these upgrades are completed and new facilities are built prices for electricity and capacity could be lower in some of our markets than they might otherwise be furthermore the prices for power and natural gas remain at historically low levels see commercial operations 

concern over the environmental impacts of climate change and fossilfueled generating station air emissions has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts at the state and federal level the costs of compliance with such efforts could affect our ability to compete in the markets in which we operate especially with our coalfired generating facilities see regulatory environment and environmental regulation for further discussion

regulatory environment 

federal state and local regulations 

ferc the electricity industry is regulated extensively at the federal state and local levels at the federal level the ferc has exclusive jurisdiction under the federal power act over sales of electricity at wholesale and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce each of our subsidiaries that owns or leases a generating facility selling at wholesale or that markets electricity at wholesale is a public utility subject to the fercs jurisdiction under the federal power act these subsidiaries must comply with certain ferc reporting requirements and fercapproved market rules and they are subject to ferc oversight of mergers and acquisitions the disposition of facilities under the fercs jurisdiction and the issuance of securities 

the ferc has authorized our subsidiaries that are public utilities under the federal power act to sell wholesale energy capacity and certain ancillary services at marketbased rates the majority of the output of the generating facilities owned by our subsidiaries is sold pursuant to this marketbased rate authorization the ferc could revoke or limit our marketbased rate authority if it were to determine that we possess insufficiently mitigated market power in a regional electricity market under the natural gas act our subsidiaries that sell natural gas for resale are deemed by the ferc to have blanket certificate authority to undertake these sales at marketbased rates 

the ferc requires that our public utility subsidiaries with marketbased rate authority and our subsidiaries with blanket certificate authority adhere to general rules against market manipulation as well as to certain market behavior rules and codes of conduct if any of our subsidiaries were found to have engaged in market manipulation the ferc has the authority to impose a civil penalty of up to 1 million per day per violation in addition to the civil penalties if any of our subsidiaries were to engage in market manipulation or violate the market behavior rules or codes of conduct the ferc could require a disgorgement of profits related to the improper activity or could revoke the subsidiarys marketbased rate 

authority or blanket certificate authority if the ferc were to revoke marketbased rate authority our affected public utility subsidiary would have to file a costbased rate schedule for all or some of its sales of electricity at wholesale 

our subsidiaries owning generating facilities have made such filings and received such orders as are necessary to obtain exempt wholesale generator status under the public utility holding company act of 2005 and the fercs regulations thereunder provided all of our subsidiaries owning or leasing generating facilities continue to be exempt wholesale generators or are qualifying facilities under the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 we and our intermediate holding companies owning direct or indirect interests in those subsidiaries will remain exempt from the accounting record retention and reporting requirements that the public utility holding company act of 2005 imposes on holding companies 

nerc in 2006 the ferc certified nerc as the national energy reliability organization nerc is responsible for the development and enforcement of mandatory reliability standards including cybersecurity standards for the electric power system each of our subsidiaries selling electricity at wholesale is responsible for complying with the reliability standards in the region in which it operates assets that have been determined to be critical physical or cybersecurity assets are not accessible via the internet nerc has the ability to assess financial penalties for noncompliance with the reliability standards which penalties can depending on the nature of the noncompliance be significant in addition to complying with the nerc standards each of our entities selling electricity at wholesale must comply with the reliability standards of the regional reliability council for the nerc region in which its sales occur 

state and local state and local regulatory authorities historically have overseen the distribution and sale of electricity at retail to the ultimate end user as well as the siting permitting and construction of generating and transmission facilities our existing generating facilities are subject to a variety of state and local regulations including regulations regarding the environment health and safety and maintenance and expansion of the facilities 

in some markets state regulators have proposed initiatives to provide longterm contracts for new generating capacity in order among other things to reduce future capacity prices in pjm in january 2011 new jersey enacted legislation which requires the board of public utilities to implement a long term capacity agreement pilot program providing for new generating capacity in the state the new generating capacity would be required to participate and be accepted as a capacity resource in the pjm capacity market the new jersey board of public utilities awarded three contracts for new generating capacity as required by the statute because the law could have a negative effect on capacity prices in pjm in future years a group of companies in february 2011 filed suit in the us district court for new jersey asking the court to declare the new jersey legislation unconstitutional that proceeding continues 

in september 2011 the maryland public service commission issued an rfp for up to 1500 mws of new natural gasfired generating capacity to be located in the southwestern midatlantic area council zone of pjm the rfp requires any such new generating capacity to bid into the capacity markets in a manner consistent with the pjm tariff the order provided for project submittals in january 2012 and a maryland public service commission hearing later in january 2012 to determine whether new generating capacity is needed to meet the longterm anticipated demand in maryland we filed comments with the maryland public service commission stating there is no need for additional capacity at this time the maryland public service commission has not issued a final decision on whether it will require the electric distribution utilities in the state to enter into contracts for new generating capacity such contracts could have a negative effect on capacity prices and energy prices in pjm in future years 

in april 2011 the ferc ordered changes in the pjm tariff to prevent interference with the capacity markets by efforts such as the new jersey legislation and the maryland rfps 

because of the interest of these two states in building new generating capacity within their respective states and the possibility of future rfps for new generating capacity we have filed interconnection requests for new generating capacity at our sayreville generating facility in new jersey and our dickerson generating facility in maryland to begin the process of reviewing the suitability of these sites on the transmission grid we have not decided to build new generating capacity at either facility 

in california instead of implementing a centralized capacity market to incent the construction of new instate generating capacity the cpuc addresses the need for new instate generating capacity through its ltpp rulemakings in february 2012 the cpuc issued a proposed decision in the current ltpp rulemaking that proposed decision if adopted would approve a settlement agreement that concludes that there is inadequate evidence in the record to authorize the procurement of new generating capacity in the pge and southern california edison service areas we have sites with existing facilities in both service areas the settlement agreement further provides that additional analysis would be necessary to determine what impacts the integration of new renewable generating resources both existing and planned and the future retirement of facilities with oncethrough cooling will have on the need for new generating capacity the proposed decision if adopted would also place limits on pges and southern california edisons authority to contract with units that rely on oncethrough cooling see below under —environmental regulation—water regulations although the settlement agreement contemplates that the additional analysis regarding the need for new generating capacity will occur during 2012 with a decision by the cpuc by the end of 2012 this timeline is uncertain if the decision identifies a need for new generating capacity we will evaluate whether to participate in the resulting processes requesting offers run by pge southern california edison or both 

isos and rtos the vast majority of our facilities operate in markets administered by isos and rtos in areas where isos or rtos control the regional transmission systems market participants have access to broader geographic markets than in regions without isos and rtos isos and rtos operate dayahead and realtime energy and ancillary services markets typically governed by fercapproved tariffs and market rules some isos and rtos also operate capacity markets changes to the applicable tariffs and market rules may be requested by the iso or rto or by other interested persons including market participants and state regulatory agencies and such proposed changes if approved by the ferc could have a significant effect on our operations and financial results although participation in isos and rtos by public utilities that own transmission has been and is expected to continue to be voluntary the majority of such public utilities in california illinois maryland massachusetts new jersey new york ohio pennsylvania and virginia have joined the applicable iso and rto 

pjm our eastern and western pjm generating facilities sell electricity into the markets operated by pjm we have access to the pjm transmission system pursuant to pjms open access transmission tariff pjm operates the pjm interchange energy market which is the regions spot market for wholesale electricity provides ancillary services for its transmission customers performs transmission planning for the region and economically dispatches generating facilities pjm administers dayahead and realtime single clearing price markets and calculates electricity prices based on a locational marginal pricing model a locational marginal pricing model determines a price for energy at each node in a particular zone taking into account the limitations and losses on transmission of electricity into the zone resulting in a higher zonal price when less expensive energy cannot be imported from another zone generation owners in pjm are subject to mitigation which limits the prices that they may receive under certain specified conditions 

loadserving entities within pjm are required to have adequate sources of capacity our generating facilities located in the eastern and western pjm region that sell electricity into the pjm market participate in the rpm forward capacity market the pjm rpm capacity auctions are designed to provide forward prices for capacity that ensure that adequate resources are in place in the correct location to meet the regions demand requirements pjm has conducted numerous capacity auctions 

since rpms inception in 2007 with the next annual auction scheduled to take place in may 2012 for the provision of capacity from june 2015 to may 2016 pjm continues to revise elements of the rpm provisions of its tariff both pursuant to those provisions and on its own volition or at the request of its stakeholders these revisions must be filed with and approved by the ferc and we either individually or as part of a group are actively involved at the ferc to protect our interests see previous discussion under ferc for our involvement at the ferc 

miso our miso generating facility sells electricity into the markets operated by miso miso manages the transmission system and provides open access to its transmission system and markets to all market participants on an equal basis miso operates physical and financial energy markets using a locational marginal pricing model which calculates a price for every generator and load point within miso and is similar to the model utilized by pjm miso operates dayahead and realtime markets into which generators can offer to provide energy miso does not currently administer a centralized capacity market instead it uses an enforceable planning reserve margin to ensure resource adequacy in july 2011 miso filed with the ferc a proposal for an auction mechanism to meet locational reserve requirements which will be established for each planning year if accepted by the ferc the first auction would take place in april 2013 for the june 2013 to may 2014 planning year miso also has an ancillary services market a feature of the ancillary services market is the addition of scarcity pricing that during supply shortages can raise the combined price of energy and ancillary services significantly higher than the previous cap of 1000mwh 

california our california generating facilities are located inside the caisos control area the caiso operates wholesale electricity markets whose key components include locational marginal pricing of energy that is similar to the locational marginal pricing in the rtoiso markets in the east dayahead and realtime markets and a transmission congestion management system the caiso also schedules transmission transactions and arranges for necessary ancillary services most sales of electricity in california are made pursuant to bilateral contracts but a significant percentage of electrical energy is sold in the dayahead and realtime markets operated by the caiso 

although the caiso does not operate a centralized capacity market the cpuc has adopted resource adequacy requirements for loadservicing entities that require those loadserving entities to procure capacity on a forward basis in an amount deemed appropriate to ensure reliable operation this resource adequacy obligation creates an opportunity for our california generating facilities to generate revenue through a capacity service offering 

in the absence of a centralized capacity market california relies on the cpucs biannual ltpp process to identify the need for new generating capacity in the service areas of the three major electrical utilities that the cpuc regulates the contract for the marsh landing generating facility was awarded based on procurement authority identified in an ltpp process we continue to monitor the cpucs ltpp proceedings to identify potential opportunities for new generating facilities 

other operations our bowline generating facility participates in a market administered by the nyiso the nyiso provides statewide transmission service under a single tariff and interfaces with neighboring market control areas to account for transmission congestion and losses the nyiso calculates energy prices using a locational marginal pricing model the nyiso also administers a spot market for energy as well as markets for installed capacity and services that are ancillary to transmission service the nyisos locational capacity market utilizes a demand curve mechanism to determine monthly capacity prices to be paid to suppliers for three capacity zones new york city long island and rest of state our facility is located in the rest of state capacity zone in september 2011 the ferc directed the nyiso to submit changes to its market rules to include criteria for the creation of new capacity zones in the nyisos capacity market if the ferc accepts the nyisos november 2011 filing of the criteria for creating new capacity zones it is possible that a new lower 

hudson valley capacity zone could be created in time for the may 2014 monthly capacity auction our facility likely would be located in the new lower hudson valley capacity zone 

our canal kendall and marthas vineyard generating facilities participate in a market administered by isone we are a member of the new england power pool which is a voluntary association of electric utilities and other market participants in connecticut maine massachusetts new hampshire rhode island and vermont and which functions as an advisory organization to isone as the rto for the new england region isone is responsible for the operation of transmission systems and for the administration and settlement of the wholesale electric energy capacity and ancillary services markets isone utilizes a locational marginal pricing model for electric energy similar to the model used in pjm miso and nyiso our generating facilities located in isone also participate in the fcm the fcm is designed to provide forward prices for capacity that ensure that adequate resources are in place to meet the regions demand isone has conducted numerous fcms and we began receiving payments in june 2010 as a result of the first auction 

our choctaw sabine and osceola generating facilities located in the southeast region do not operate in a market that is operated by an rto or iso opportunities to negotiate bilateral contracts and longterm transactions with investor owned utilities municipalities and cooperatives exist within this region in addition to entering into bilateral transactions there is a limited opportunity to sell into the shortterm market access to the transmission system in this region to which the generating facility is interconnected is governed by the ferc approved terms and conditions of the applicable transmission providers open access transmission tariff 

in the entergy corporation subregion which the choctaw facility can access southwest power pool has been designated as the independent coordinator of transmission in this capacity the independent coordinator of transmission provides oversight of the entergy transmission system in april 2011 entergy corporation announced that it was joining miso with a targeted integration date of december 2013 if entergy corporation successfully joins miso our choctaw facility should be able to participate in misos dayahead and realtime markets in december 2011 entergy corporation announced that it will divest and then merge its transmission assets into itc holdings corp an independent transmission company in 2013 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities under a variety of statutes regulations and permits that address the discharge of materials into the air water and soil the proper handling of solid hazardous and toxic materials and waste and noise safety and health standards applicable to the workplace complying with these environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating expenses we decide to invest capital for environmental controls based on relatively certain regulations an evaluation of various options for regulatory compliance including different technologies and fuel modification and the expected economic returns on the capital as previously stated we expect industry retirements to contribute to a tightening of supply and demand fundamentals and higher prices for the remaining generating facilities consequently we expect the resulting higher market prices to provide adequate returns on investment in environmental controls necessary to meet promulgated and anticipated requirements accordingly we expect to invest approximately 586 million to 726 million over the next ten years for scrs and other major environmental controls to meet certain naaqs new jersey no x  mats and various water quality requirements see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—capital expenditures and capital resources and environmental matters for additional information some of these requirements are under revision andor in dispute and some new requirements are pending or under consideration 

air emissions regulations 

the clean air act and the resulting regulations as well as similar state and local requirements have been and will continue to be a focal point for us because they mandate a broad range of requirements concerning air quality air emissions operating practices and pollution control equipment under the clean air act the epa sets naaqs for pollutants thought to be harmful to public health and the environment including so 2  ozone and fine particulate matter pm 25  most of our facilities are located in or near areas that are classified by the epa as not achieving certain naaqs nonattainment areas the relevant naaqs have become more stringent and we expect that trend to continue as a result of such classification and the manner in which regulators seek to achieve the naaqs our operations generally are subject to more stringent air pollution requirements than those applicable to facilities located elsewhere the states are generally free to impose requirements that are more stringent than those imposed by the federal government we expect increased regulation at both the federal and state levels of our air emissions we maintain a comprehensive compliance strategy to address these continuing and new requirements complying with increasingly stringent naaqs may require us to install and operate additional emissions control equipment at some of our facilities if we decide to continue to operate such facilities subject to market prices and based on anticipated more stringent naaqs for ozone and pm 25  we expect to invest between 315 million and 418 million in capital expenditures during 2018 to 2021 at our chalk point and dickerson generating facilities significant air regulatory programs to which we are subject are described below 

crossstate air pollution rule in 2005 the epa promulgated the cair which established so 2 and no x capandtrade programs applicable directly to states and indirectly to generating facilities in the eastern united states the no x capandtrade program has two components an annual program and an ozoneseason program the cair so 2 capandtrade program builds off the existing acid rain capandtrade program but requires generating facilities to surrender twice as many allowances to cover emissions from 2010 through 2014 and approximately three times as many allowances starting in 2015 florida illinois maryland mississippi new jersey new york ohio pennsylvania and virginia are subject to the cairs so 2 trading program and both its no x trading programs massachusetts is subject only to the cairs ozoneseason no x trading program these capandtrade programs were to be implemented in two phases with the first phase going into effect in 2009 for no x and 2010 for so 2 and more stringent caps going into effect in 2015 in july 2008 the dc circuit in state of north carolina v environmental protection agency issued an opinion that would have vacated the cair various parties filed requests for rehearing with the dc circuit and in december 2008 the dc circuit issued a second opinion in which it granted rehearing only to the extent that it remanded the case to the epa without vacating the cair 

in august 2011 the epa finalized the csapr which was intended to replace the cair starting in 2012 in september 2011 we and others asked the dc circuit to stay and vacate the csapr because among other reasons the rule circumvents the state implementation plan process expressly provided for in the clean air act affords affected parties no time to install compliance equipment before the compliance period starts and includes numerous material changes from the proposed rule which deprived parties of an opportunity to provide comments in december 2011 the court ordered the epa to stay implementation of the csapr and to keep cair in place until the court rules on the legal deficiencies alleged with respect to the csapr the csapr addresses interstate transport of emissions of no x and so 2  the csapr establishes limitations on no x andor so 2 emissions from electric generating units that are i greater than 25 megawatts and ii located in 28 states in the eastern half of the united states that the epa determined contribute significantly to nonattainment in other states or to interfere with maintenance in other states of one or more of three naaqs a the annual naaqs for fine particulate matter pm 25  promulgated in 1997 b the 24hour naaqs for pm 25 promulgated in 2006 and c the ozone naaqs promulgated in 1997 the csapr creates 

emission budgets for each of the covered states and allocates emissions allowances denominated in tons of emissions to each of the 28 states regulated under the csapr 

under the csapr program the epa established new allowances for all of the new csapr programs and did not permit any carryover of acid rain program or cair allowances into the csapr trading programs as a result the no x allowances from the cair program would not have been used accordingly we thought that the cair no x allowances would have no value after 2011 similarly the so 2 allowances used for compliance in the cair program which used the already existing acid rain program allowances that would have continued to be useable for compliance with the acid rain program would not have been usable for compliance with the csapr so 2 program and we thought they would have negligible value after 2011 as a result of the csapr we recorded impairment losses during 2011 of 133 million for the writeoff of excess no x and so 2 emissions allowances see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

we expect that if the csapr stay is lifted it will result in reduced generation volumes from uncontrolled coalfired plants increased generation from gasfired plants increased market power prices and increased emissions costs offset by allocated allowances the effect of the csapr on our adjusted ebitda depends on the price of the emissions allowances liquidity in the emissions allowances markets and whether we choose to monetize the allowances even if the csapr becomes effective at some point our planned deactivations in response to mats are expected to mitigate the csapr effect starting in the second half of the decade 

maryland healthy air act the maryland healthy air act was enacted in 2006 and required reductions in so 2  no x and mercury emissions from large coalfired power facilities the state law also required maryland to join the rggi which is discussed below the maryland healthy air act and the regulations adopted by mde to implement that act impose limits for a emissions of no x in 2009 with further reductions in 2012 including sublimits during the ozone season and b emissions of so 2 in 2010 with further reductions in 2013 the maryland healthy air act also imposes restrictions on emissions of mercury beginning in 2010 with further reductions in 2013 the maryland healthy air act imposes fixed limits and owners of power facilities may not exceed these fixed limits by purchasing emissions allowances to comply 

we installed scrubbers at our chalk point dickerson and morgantown coalfired units in addition we installed scr systems at the morgantown coalfired units and one of the chalk point coalfired units and a selective autocatalytic reduction system at the other chalk point coalfired unit we also installed sncr systems at the three dickerson coalfired units the control equipment we have installed allows our maryland generating facilities to comply with a the first phase of the cair without having to purchase emissions allowances and b all of the requirements of the maryland healthy air act 

in 2009 we completed installation of the scrubbers we expect to invest approximately 1674 billion in capital expenditures of which 1591 billion had been invested at december 31 2011 to comply with the requirements for so 2  no x and mercury emissions under the maryland healthy air act in july 2007 we entered into an agreement with stone  webster for epc services relating to the installation of the scrubbers described above the cost under the agreement was approximately 11 billion and is a part of the 1674 billion described above see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

new jersey in april 2009 the njdep finalized a regulation requiring a twophase reduction in no x emissions from combustion turbines in new jersey phase i requires reductions during high electricity demand days and runs from may 2009 through 2014 under our compliance plan we operate enhanced no x controls at our shawville pennsylvania generating facility upwind from new jersey on high energy demand days phase ii requires the installation of scrs at our gilbert sayreville and werner generating facilities by may 1 2015 we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately 

129 million to 151 million primarily during 2012 to 2015 in connection with our phase ii control plan as discussed above in business segments—western pjmmiso segment we plan to place the coalfired units at the shawville facility in longterm protective layup in april 2015 

mats in february 2012 the epa promulgated emission standards for haps from coal and oilfired units the epa established limits for mercury nonmercury metals certain organics and acid gases which limits must be met beginning in april 2015 these limits are referred to as the mact standards and they a will require us as a condition of continuing to operate to add and operate some additional emissions control equipment at some of our facilities the cost of which will be significant and b will result in the shutdown or retirement of some coalfired facilities including some of ours for which current and forecasted market conditions do not justify the required capital expenditures see business segments above for a discussion of coalfired generating facilities that we expect to deactivate between 2012 and 2015 we expect that higher earnings from price increases resulting from industry retirements will more than offset reduced earnings from our unit deactivations we plan to upgrade the fgd and invest in an scr at our conemaugh generating facility by april 2015 based on our 1645 interest in conemaugh our net share of these capital expenditures is expected to be between 93 million and 102 million and will occur primarily during 2012 to 2015 

new source review enforcement initiative the epa and various states are investigating compliance of coalfired electric generating facilities with the preconstruction permitting requirements of the clean air act known as new source review in the past decade the epa has made information requests for our avon lake chalk point cheswick conemaugh dickerson elrama keystone morgantown new castle niles portland potomac river shawville and titus generating facilities we are corresponding or have corresponded with the epa regarding all of these requests if a violation is determined to have occurred at any of the facilities our subsidiary owning or leasing the facilities may be responsible for the cost of purchasing and installing emissions control equipment the cost of which may be material several of our generating facilities already have installed a variety of emissions control equipment if such a violation is determined to have occurred after our subsidiaries acquired or leased the facilities or if occurring prior to the acquisition or lease is determined to constitute a continuing violation our subsidiary owning or leasing the facility at issue could also be subject to fines and penalties by the state or federal government for the period after its acquisition or lease of the facility the cost of which may be material although applicable bankruptcy law may bar such liability for the chalk point dickerson morgantown and potomac river generating facilities for periods prior to january 3 2006 when the plan became effective see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

regulation of greenhouse gases concern over climate change has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts at the state and federal level to limit greenhouse gas emissions especially co 2  

rggi rggi is a multistate initiative in the eastern pjm and northeast outlining a capandtrade program to reduce co 2 emissions from electric generating units with capacity of 25 mw or greater the rggi program calls for signatory states which include maryland massachusetts new jersey through 2011 and new york to stabilize co 2 emissions to an established baseline from 2009 through 2014 followed by a 25 reduction each year from 2015 through 2018 each of those states promulgated regulations implementing the rggi new jersey withdrew from the rggi at the end of 2011 

complying with the rggi could have a material adverse effect upon our operations and our operating costs depending upon the availability and cost of emissions allowances and the extent to which such costs may be offset by higher market prices to recover increases in operating costs caused by the rggi as contemplated in a memorandum of understanding among the participating states regional greenhouse gas initiative inc is comprehensively reviewing the program which may cause 

the participating states to change the manner in which the program is administered and may increase our cost to comply 

during 2011 we produced approximately 136 million tons of co 2 at our maryland massachusetts new jersey and new york generating facilities for a total cost of 25 million under the rggi in 2012 we expect to produce approximately 124 million tons of co 2 at our maryland massachusetts and new york generating facilities the rggi regulations required those facilities to obtain allowances to emit co 2 beginning in 2009 annual allowances generally were not granted to existing sources of such emissions instead allowances have been made available for such facilities by purchase through periodic auctions conducted quarterly or through subsequent purchase from a party that holds allowances sold through a quarterly auction 

ab 32 in california emissions of greenhouse gases are governed by ab 32 which requires that statewide greenhouse gas emissions be reduced to 1990 levels by 2020 in december 2008 the carb approved a scoping plan for implementing ab 32 the scoping plan requires that the carb adopt a capandtrade regulation by january 2011 and that the capandtrade program begin in 2012 in march 2011 a california superior court judge enjoined the implementation of the capandtrade program and related scoping plan measures until the carb remedies various procedural flaws related to the carbs environmental review of the scoping plan under the california environmental quality act a state appellate court stayed the injunction allowing the carb to continue to develop the final capandtrade regulation in october 2011 the carb adopted these final capandtrade regulations with an initial compliance period of 20132014 for electric utilities and large industrial facilities in december 2011 the superior court judge affirmed that the carb remedied the flaws in its environmental review of the scoping plan our california generating facilities will be required to comply with the capandtrade regulations and related rules when they go into effect the recently adopted capandtrade regulation and any other plans rules and programs approved to implement ab 32 could adversely affect the costs of operating the facilities however in accordance with our tolling agreements for the northern california generating facilities we would pass any applicable costs through to the counterparties we have hedged some of the output of our facilities with structures other than tolling agreements with these hedges we retain some limited exposure to costs associated with the capandtrade regulation 

pennsylvania climate change act in july 2008 the pennsylvania climate change act was adopted this legislation requires development of reports of the effects of climate change in pennsylvania and potential economic opportunities resulting from mitigation strategies it requires development of an annual statelevel greenhouse gas emissions inventory and baseline a voluntary registry and establishment of costeffective statelevel strategies for reducing or offsetting greenhouse gases the climate change advisory committee established by the act published a climate change action plan in december 2009 the plan includes numerous recommendations to reduce 2020 greenhouse gas emissions in the state by 30 percent below 2000 levels recommendations affecting fossil power generation are carbon capture and sequestration at selected coalfired units and minimum efficiency improvements the plan also recommends greenhouse gas performance standards for new power plants 

massachusetts climate protection act in august 2008 massachusetts adopted the climate protection act which establishes a program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly over the next 40 years under the climate protection act the madep has established a reporting and verification system for statewide greenhouse gas emissions including emissions from generating facilities producing all electricity consumed in massachusetts and determined the states greenhouse gas emissions level in 1990 under the climate protection act the maeea is to establish statewide greenhouse gas emissions limits effective beginning in 2020 that will reduce such emissions from the 1990 level by a range of 10 to 25 beginning in 2020 with the reduction increasing to 80 below the 1990 level by 2050 in setting these limits the maeea is to consider the potential costs and benefits of various reduction measures including emissions limits for electric generating facilities and may consider the use of marketbased compliance mechanisms a violation of the emissions limits established under the climate protection act may result in a civil penalty of up to 25000 per day implementation of the climate protection act could have a material adverse effect on how we operate our massachusetts generating facilities and the costs of operating those facilities in december 2010 the maeea established a limit for 2020 that is 25 less than the 1990 level 

maryland greenhouse gas act in april 2009 the maryland general assembly passed the maryland greenhouse gas act which became effective in october 2009 the maryland greenhouse gas act requires a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in maryland by 25 from 2006 levels by 2020 however this provision of the maryland greenhouse gas act is only in effect through 2016 unless a subsequent statutory enactment extends its effective period under the maryland greenhouse gas act the mde plans to complete its proposed implementation plan in early 2012 to achieve these reductions and to adopt a final plan by the end of 2012 

federal rules regarding co 2  in light of the united states supreme court ruling in massachusetts v epa that greenhouse gases fit within the clean air acts definition of air pollutant the epa has proposed and promulgated regulations regarding the emission of greenhouse gases in september 2009 the epa issued a rule that requires owners of facilities in many sectors of the economy including power generation to report annually to the epa the quantity and source of greenhouse gas emissions released from those facilities in addition to this reporting requirement the epa has promulgated several rules that address greenhouse gas emissions in december 2009 under a portion of the clean air act that regulates vehicles the epa determined that elevated concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere endanger the publics health and welfare through their contribution to climate change endangerment finding in april 2010 the epa finalized a rule to regulate greenhouse gases from vehicles beginning in model year 2012 vehicle rule in april 2010 the epa also issued its reconsideration of interpretation of regulations that determine pollutants covered by clean air act permitting programs tailoring rule which addresses the scope of pollutants subject to certain permitting requirements under the clean air act as well as when such requirements become effective the epa has stated that because of the vehicle rule emissions of greenhouse gases from new stationary sources such as power plants and from major modifications to such sources are subject to certain clean air act permitting requirements as of january 2011 these permitting requirements require such sources to use best available control technology to limit their greenhouse gases legal challenges to the endangerment finding the vehicle rule and the tailoring rule have been consolidated and are pending review the additional substantive requirements under the clean air act that may apply or may come to apply to stationary sources such as power plants are not clear at this time 

in december 2010 the epa announced that it was starting the process of developing regulations under the new source performance standard section of the clean air act that would affect new and existing fossilfueled generating facilities the epa intends to propose regulations regarding new units in early 2012 and expects to finalize such regulations by late 2012 

in addition to the state and regional regulatory matters described above over the last several years various bills have been proposed in congress to govern co 2 emissions from generating facilities 

including the creation of a capandtrade system that would require us to purchase allowances for some or all of the co 2 emitted by our generating facilities if co 2 regulation becomes more stringent we expect the demand for natural gas andor renewable sources of electricity will increase over time although we expect that market prices for electricity would increase following such regulation and would allow us to recover a portion of the cost of these allowances we cannot predict with any certainty the actual increases in costs such regulation could impose upon us or our ability to recover such cost increases through higher market rates for electricity and such regulation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of operations financial position and cash flows although it is possible that congress will take action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions we do not think this is likely to occur in the near term the form and timing of any final legislation will be influenced by political and economic factors and is uncertain at this time implementation of a co 2 capandtrade program in addition to other emission control requirements could increase the likelihood of retirements of coalfired generating facilities during 2011 we produced approximately 335 million tons of co 2 at our generating facilities we expect to produce approximately 279 million total tons of co 2 at our generating facilities in 2012 

water regulations 

clean water act we are required under the clean water act to comply with intake and discharge requirements requirements for technological controls and operating practices to discharge water we generally need permits required by the clean water act such permits typically are subject to review every five years as with air quality regulations federal and state water regulations are expected to impose additional and more stringent requirements or limitations in the future this is particularly the case for regulatory requirements governing cooling water intake structures which are subject to regulation under section 316b of the clean water act the 316b regulations in april 2011 the epa proposed a 316b rule that would apply to virtually all existing facilities including power plants that use cooling water intake structures to withdraw water from waters of the united states that proposal would impose national standards for reducing mortality for larger impingeablesized organisms it would require permit writers to establish controls for smaller entrainablesized organisms on a sitespecific basis taking into account a variety of factors including costs and benefits the final rule may differ from the proposal as a result of the public comment process until the epa issues the final rule which it has committed to do by july 2012 there is significant uncertainty regarding what technologies or other measures will be needed to satisfy section 316b regulations 

the epa also is in the process of updating its technologybased regulations regarding discharges from power plants the epa has collected information from numerous power plants to inform this rulemaking the new standards have not yet been proposed accordingly we cannot predict their effect on our business 

oncethrough cooling in october 2010 the california state water resources control boards policy on the use of coastal and estuarine waters for power plant cooling oncethrough cooling policy became effective compliance options for our affected generating units include transitioning to a closedcycle cooling system retiring or submitting an alternative plan that meets equivalent mitigation criteria the specified compliance date for our pittsburg and contra costa generating facilities is december 31 2017 and for our mandalay and ormond beach generating facilities the date is december 31 2020 we will retire the contra costa generating facility in may 2013 subject to regulatory approvals subject to market prices we expect to invest between 17 million and 20 million in capital expenditures during 2018 and 2019 at our mandalay and ormond beach generating facilities for variable speed drive pumps however we will continue to analyze compliance options for our pittsburg mandalay and ormond beach generating facilities for certain of our california generating facilities the oncethrough cooling policy could have a material adverse effect on how we operate those facilities and the costs of operating those facilities in october 2010 we and several other 

companies jointly filed a lawsuit in california superior court challenging the california state water resources control boards issuance of the oncethrough cooling policy on various procedural and substantive grounds the lawsuit seeks a writ directing the california state water resources control board to vacate and set aside approval of the oncethrough cooling policy a hearing on the merits is scheduled for march 2012 

endangered species act our use of water from the sacramentosan joaquin delta at the contra costa and pittsburg generating facilities potentially affects certain fish species protected under the federal endangered species act we therefore must maintain authorization to engage in operations that could result in a take of ie cause harm to fish of the protected species in september 2007 the delta noticing parties notified us of their intent to sue alleging that we violated and continue to violate the federal endangered species act because we operate the contra costa and pittsburg generating facilities in october 2007 the united states fish and wildlife service the national marine fisheries service and the army corps of engineers initiated a process that reviewed the environmental effects of our water usage including effects on the protected species of fish they also clarified that we continued to be authorized to take four species of fish protected under the federal endangered species act in may 2009 the coalition for a sustainable delta kern county water agency and an individual sent a new notice of intent to sue to the army corps of engineers alleging that the army corps of engineers had violated the federal endangered species act by issuing permits related to the operation of the contra costa and pittsburg generating facilities we dispute the allegations made by the delta noticing parties and those made in the may 2009 notice 

in february 2010 we entered into a settlement agreement with the delta noticing parties the parties to the may 2009 notice of intent to sue and the army corps of engineers the settlement agreement provides for the delta noticing parties and the parties to the may 2009 notice of intent to sue to withdraw the two notices of intent to sue and to release all claims described in those notices the settlement agreement obligated us to monitor entrainment and impingement of aquatic species caused by the operation of our generating facilities we have completed the monitoring activities the settlement agreement requires the army corps of engineers to use its best efforts to conclude ongoing consultations with the united states fish and wildlife service and the national marine fisheries service regarding the environmental effects of our water usage in a timely manner and allows the delta noticing parties and the parties to the may 2009 notice of intent to sue to issue new notices of intent to sue if such consultations were not completed by october 31 2011 the national marine fisheries service completed its consultation in february 2012 and consultation with the united states fish and wildlife service is pending we have apprised the delta noticing parties of the status of such consultations 

kendall npdes and surface water discharge permit in september 2006 the epa issued an npdes renewal permit for the kendall cogeneration facility the same permit was concurrently issued by the madep as a state swd permit and was accompanied by madeps earlier issued water quality certificate under section 401 of the clean water act these permits sought to impose new temperature limits at various points in the charles river an extensive temperature water quality and biological monitoring program and a requirement to develop and install a barrier net system to reduce fish impingement and entrainment the provisions regulating the thermal discharge could have caused substantial curtailments of the operations of the kendall generating facility we appealed the permits in three proceedings a appeal of the npdes permit to the epas environmental appeals board b appeal of the swd permit to the madep and c appeal of the water quality certification to the madep the effect of the permits was stayed pending the outcome of these appeals in march 2008 the epa and the madep issued a draft permit modification to address the 316b provisions of the permit that would have required modifications to the intake structure for the kendall generating facility to add fine and coarse mesh barrier exclusion technologies and a mechanism to sweep organisms away from the intake structure through an induced water flow in may 2008 we submitted comments on the 

draft permit modification objecting to the new requirements in december 2008 the epa and the madep issued final permit modifications to address the 316b regulations those final permit modifications did not substantially modify the requirements proposed in the draft modifications and in february 2009 we filed an appeal of those modifications 

in october 2010 we submitted a permit modification request to the epa and madep that requested modification of the 2006 permits as previously modified in 2008 to reflect revised permit terms agreed upon by us the epa and madep as part of a settlement of the permit renewal proceedings pending before the epa and madep the settlement contemplates that an additional steam pipeline will be installed across the charles river to allow us to make additional steam sales to trigenboston energy corporation in boston and that we will install a back pressure steam turbine and aircooled condenser at the kendall generating facility this new pipeline and equipment once operational would allow us to reduce significantly the use of water from the charles river in october 2010 the epa and madep issued the proposed revised permits the 2010 kendall permits as draft permit modifications for public comment in december 2010 the epa and madep issued final permits that became effective in february 2011 the 2010 kendall permits will limit us to drawing no more than 32 million gallons of water per day from the river under normal operations impose temperature limits similar to the 2006 permits and require monitoring of temperatures at various points in the river when the kendall generating facility is discharging water to the river because river water will no longer be used for oncethrough cooling under normal operations once the new pipeline and equipment have been installed we expect the 2010 kendall permits to impose significantly less risk that operations of the facility would have to be curtailed to maintain compliance with the temperature limits as part of our settlement with the epa and madep the epa and madep issued administrative orders that provide deadlines for achieving certain milestones associated with the installation of the back pressure steam turbine aircooled condenser and the new steam pipeline the administrative orders allow us to defer the new limit on the amount of river water used by the kendall cogenerating facility and the new temperature limits imposed by the 2010 kendall permits until installation has been completed of the new pipeline the back pressure steam turbine and the aircooled condenser which is expected to occur in 2014 capital expenditures for this project are expected to be between 32 million and 35 million primarily during 2012 to 2014 

canal npdes and swd permit in august 2008 the epa issued an npdes renewal permit for the canal generating facility the same permit was concurrently issued by madep as a state swd permit and was accompanied by madeps earlier water quality certificate under section 401 of the clean water act the new permit imposes a requirement on us to install closed cycle cooling or an alternative technology that will reduce the entrainment of marine organisms by the canal generating facility to levels equivalent to what would be achieved by closed cycle cooling we appealed the npdes permit to the epas environmental appeals board and appealed the surface water discharge and the water quality certificate to the madep in december 2008 the epa requested a stay to the appeal proceedings and withdrew provisions related to the closed cycle cooling requirements the epa has renoticed these provisions as draft conditions for additional public comment we filed comments in january 2009 stating that installing closed cycle cooling at the canal generating facility was not justified and that without some costrecovery mechanism the cost would make continued operation of the facility uneconomic while the appeals of the renewal permit are pending the effect of any contested permit provisions is stayed and the canal generating facility will continue to operate under its current npdes permit we are unable to predict the outcome of this proceeding 

shawville npdes permit appeal in august 2010 the padep issued a renewed npdes permit effective september 2010 that contains discharge limits for the leased shawville generating facility that require installation of cooling towers or reduction in plant operation by september 1 2013 the pennsylvania fish  boat commission and we appealed the permit to the pennsylvania environmental hearing board we have recently entered into an agreement that resulted in a revised permit that 

delays this requirement until july 2015 in february 2012 the sierra club appealed the revised permit to the pennsylvania environmental hearing board as discussed above in business segments—western pjmmiso segment we plan to place the coalfired units at the shawville generating facility in longterm protective layup in april 2015 

npdes and state pollutant discharge elimination system permit renewals in addition to the various npdes proceedings described above proceedings are currently pending for renewal of the npdes or state pollutant discharge elimination system permits at many of our generating facilities and ash disposal sites in general the epa and the state agencies responsible for implementing the provisions of the clean water act applicable to the intake of water and discharge of effluent by electric generating facilities have been making the requirements imposed upon such facilities more stringent over time with respect to each of these permit renewal proceedings the permit renewal proceeding could take years to resolve and the agency or agencies involved could impose requirements upon the entity owning the facility that require significant capital expenditures limit the times at which the facility can operate or increase operations and maintenance costs materially 

byproducts wastes hazardous materials and contamination 

our facilities are subject to laws and regulations governing waste management the federal resource conservation and recovery act of 1976 and many analogous state laws contains comprehensive requirements for the handling of solid and hazardous wastes the generation of electricity produces nonhazardous and hazardous materials and we incur substantial costs to store and dispose of waste materials the epa and the states in which we operate coalfired units may develop new regulations that impose additional requirements on facilities that store or dispose of materials remaining after the combustion of fossil fuels including coal ash if so we may be required to change our current waste management practices at some facilities and incur additional costs 

in june 2010 the epa proposed two alternatives for regulating byproducts of coal combustion eg ash and gypsum under the federal resource conservation and recovery act of 1976 under the first proposal these byproducts would be regulated as solid wastes under the second proposal these byproducts would be regulated as special wastes in a manner similar to the regulation of hazardous waste with an exception for beneficial reuse of these byproducts the second alternative would impose significantly more stringent requirements on and increase materially the cost of disposal of coal combustion byproducts 

we acquired our contra costa pittsburg and potrero generating facilities from pge all three have areas of soil and groundwater contamination in 1998 prior to our acquisition of those facilities from pge consultants for pge conducted soil and groundwater investigations at those facilities which revealed contamination the consultants conducting the investigation estimated the aggregate cleanup costs at those facilities could be as much as 60 million pursuant to the terms of the purchase and sale agreement with pge pge has responsibility for the containment or capping of all soil and groundwater contamination and the disposition of up to 60000 cubic yards of contaminated soil from the potrero generating facility and the remediation of any groundwater or solid contamination identified by pges consultants in 1998 at the contra costa and pittsburg generating facilities before we purchased those facilities in 1999 pursuant to our requests pge has disposed of 807 cubic yards of contaminated soil from the potrero generating facility we are not aware of soil or groundwater conditions at our contra costa pittsburg and potrero generating facilities for which we expect remediation costs to be material that are not the responsibility of other parties 

in 2008 we closed and then demolished the lovett generating facility in new york pursuant to an agreement with the new york state department of environmental conservation in 2009 we assessed the environmental condition of the property during late 2011 the new york state department of environmental conservation indicated the site characterization work was acceptable and requested we 

engage in an assessment of remedial alternatives for issues identified at the site we are in the process determining these alternatives however we have not completed this process 

we are responsible for environmental costs related to site contamination investigations and remediation requirements at four generating facilities in new jersey we recorded the estimated longterm liability for the remediation costs of 6 million at december 31 2011 see notes 1 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements regarding discussion of storm damage and remediation at our brandywine ash disposal site 

other as a result of their age many of our plants contain significant amounts of asbestos insulation other asbestos containing materials as well as leadbased paint we think we properly manage and dispose of such materials in compliance with state and federal rules 

additionally cercla also known as the superfund law establishes a federal framework for dealing with the cleanup of contaminated sites many states have enacted similar state superfund statutes as well as other laws imposing obligations to investigate and clean up contamination these laws impose clean up and restoration liability on owners and operators of plants from or at which there has been a release or threatened release of hazardous substances together with those who have transported or arranged for the disposal of those substances we do not think we have any material liabilities or obligations under cercla or similar state laws 

employees 

at february 10 2012 we employed 3103 people which included 2262 employees at our generating facilities 400 employees at our regional offices and 441 employees at our corporate 

headquarters in houston texas the following details the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements 



1 as a result of the shutdown of the potrero generating facility in february 2011 we downsized the bargaining unit workforce consistent with an agreement negotiated with local 1245 

we intend to negotiate the renewal of the collective bargaining agreement expiring in 2012 and do not anticipate any disruptions to our operations to mitigate and reduce the risk of disruption during labor negotiations we engage in contingency planning for operation of our generating facilities to the extent possible during an adverse collective action by one or more of our unions

 item 1a risk factors 

we are subject to the following factors that could have a material adverse effect on our future performance results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition such factors could affect our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations our ability to raise capital and our future growth opportunities also see cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information on page vi business in item 1 and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this form 10k 

risks related to the operation of our business 

our financial results are unpredictable because most of our generating facilities operate without longterm power sales agreements and our revenues and results of operations depend on market and competitive forces that are beyond our control 

we provide energy capacity ancillary and other energy services from our generating facilities in a variety of markets and to bilateral counterparties including participating in wholesale energy markets entering into tolling agreements sales of resource adequacy and participation in capacity auctions our revenues from selling capacity are a significant part of our overall revenues we are not guaranteed recovery of our costs or any return on our capital investments through mandated rates 

the market for wholesale electric energy and energy services reflects various market conditions beyond our control including the balance of supply and demand transmission congestion our competitors marginal and longterm costs of production the price of fuel and the effect of market regulation the price at which we can sell our output may fluctuate on a daytoday basis and our ability to transact may be affected by the overall liquidity in the markets in which we operate these markets remain subject to regulations that limit our ability to raise prices during periods of shortage to the degree that would occur in a fully deregulated market in addition unlike most other commodities electric energy can be stored only on a very limited basis and generally must be produced at the time of use as a result the wholesale power markets are subject to substantial price fluctuations over relatively short periods of time and can be unpredictable for further discussion see business—competitive environment 

our revenues results of operations and cash flows are influenced by factors that are beyond our control including those set forth above as well as 

• the failure of market regulators to develop and maintain efficient mechanisms to compensate merchant generators for the value of providing capacity needed to meet demand • actions by regulators isos rtos and other bodies that may artificially modify supply and demand levels and prevent capacity and energy prices from rising to the level necessary for recovery of our costs our investment and an adequate return on our investment • legal and political challenges to or changes in the rules used to calculate capacity payments in the markets in which we operate or the establishment of bifurcated markets incentives other market design changes or bidding requirements that give preferential treatment to new generating facilities over existing generating facilities or otherwise reduce capacity payments to existing generating facilities • the ability of wholesale purchasers of power to make timely payment for energy or capacity which may be adversely affected by factors such as retail rate caps refusals by regulators to allow utilities to recover fully their wholesale power costs and investments through rates catastrophic losses and losses from investments by utilities in unregulated businesses • increases in prevailing market prices for fuel oil coal natural gas and emissions allowances that may not be reflected in prices we receive for sales of energy 30 

• increases in electricity supply as a result of actions of our current competitors or new market entrants including the development of new generating facilities or alternative energy sources that may be able to produce electricity less expensively than our generating facilities and improvements in transmission that allow additional supply to reach our markets • increases in credit standards margin requirements market volatility or other market conditions that could increase our obligations to post collateral beyond amounts that are expected including additional collateral costs associated with otc hedging activities as a result of future otc regulations adopted pursuant to the doddfrank act • decreases in energy consumption resulting from demandside management programs such as automated demand response which may alter the amount and timing of consumer energy use • the competitive advantages of certain competitors including continued operation of older power facilities in strategic locations after recovery of historic capital costs from ratepayers • existing or future regulation of our markets by the ferc isos and rtos including any price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the price volatility or illiquidity in these markets or the physical stability of the system • our obligation under any default sharing mechanisms in rto and iso markets such mechanisms exist to spread the risk of defaults by transmission owning companies or other rto members across all market participants • regulatory policies of state agencies that affect the willingness of our customers to enter into longterm contracts generally and contracts for capacity in particular • access to contractors and equipment • changes in the rate of growth in electricity usage as a result of such factors as national and regional economic conditions and implementation of conservation programs • seasonal variations in energy and natural gas prices and capacity payments and • seasonal fluctuations in weather in particular abnormal weather conditions we expect that higher earnings from price increases resulting from industry retirements will more than offset reduced earnings from our unit deactivations however as discussed above the market for wholesale electric energy and energy services reflects various market conditions beyond our control including the balance of supply and demand our competitors marginal and longterm costs of production and the effect of market regulation we cannot ensure that higher earnings or price increases will result from industry retirements of coalfired generating facilities or that higher earnings from our remaining facilities will offset or more than offset reduced earnings from our facility deactivations 

changes in the wholesale energy markets or in our generating facility operations as a result of increased environmental requirements could result in impairments or other charges 

if our ongoing evaluation of our business results in decisions to deactivate or dispose of additional facilities we could have impairments or other charges including charges relating to the assets of rri energy that were recorded at fair values in conjunction with the merger these evaluations involve significant judgments about the future actual future market prices project costs and other factors could be materially different from our current estimates see business segments above for a discussion of coalfired generating facilities that we expect to deactivate between 2012 and 2015 

our marsh landing development project is subject to construction risks and if we are unsuccessful in addressing those risks we may not recover our investment in the project or our return on the project may be lower than expected 

our return on the marsh landing development project may be lower than expected if genon marsh landing does not complete construction of the generating facility by the required completion date under its longterm ppa with pge should the facility fail to be operational or not perform as required under the terms of the ppa pge may have the right to terminate the ppa a termination of the ppa would trigger an event of default under the genon marsh landing credit facility as there is currently no wholesale capacity market in california if pge were to terminate the ppa the ability to refinance the project would likely be limited genon marsh landings contingent obligations for delay damages or termination payments under the ppa were 54 million at december 31 2011 and escalate over the construction period see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of letters of credit issued and surety bonds posted to secure genon marsh landings obligations to pge and to kiewit and in connection with the marsh landing development project 

we are exposed to the risk of fuel cost volatility because we must prepurchase coal and oil 

most of our fuel contracts are at fixed prices with terms of two years or less although we purchase coal and oil based on our expected requirements we still face the risks of fuel price volatility if we require more fuel than we expected 

our cost of fuel may not reflect changes in energy and fuel prices in part because we must prepurchase inventories of coal and oil for reliability and dispatch requirements and thus the price of fuel may have been determined at an earlier date than the price of energy generated from the fuel similarly the price we can obtain from the sale of energy may not rise at the same rate or may not rise at all to match a rise in fuel costs 

we are exposed to the risk of our fuel providers and fuel transportation providers failing to perform 

for our coalfired generating facilities we purchase most of our coal from a limited number of suppliers because of a variety of operational issues our coal suppliers may not provide the contractual quantities on the dates specified within our agreements or the deliveries may be carried over to future periods also interruptions to planned or contracted deliveries to our generating facilities can result from a lack of or constraints in coal transportation because of rail river or road system disruptions adverse weather conditions and other factors 

if our coal suppliers do not perform in accordance with the agreements we may have to procure higher priced coal in the market to meet our needs or higher priced power in the market to meet our obligations in addition generally our coal suppliers do not have investment grade credit ratings nor do they post collateral with us and accordingly we may have limited ability to collect damages in the event of default by such suppliers for a discussion of our coal supplier concentration risk see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

for our oilfired generating facilities we typically purchase fuel from a limited number of suppliers if our oil suppliers do not perform in accordance with the agreements we may have to procure higher priced oil in the market to meet our needs or higher priced power in the market to meet our obligations for our gasfired generating facilities any curtailments or interruptions on transporting pipelines could result in curtailment of our operations or increased fuel supply costs 

operation of our generating facilities involves risks that could result in disruption curtailment or inefficiencies in our operations 

the operation of our generating facilities involves various operating risks including but not limited to 

• the output and efficiency levels at which those generating facilities perform • interruptions in fuel supply and quality of available fuel • disruptions in the delivery of electricity • adverse zoning • breakdowns or equipment failures whether a result of age or otherwise • violations of our permit requirements or changes in the terms of or revocation of permits • releases of pollutants and hazardous substances to air soil surface water or groundwater • ability to transport and dispose of coal ash at reasonable prices • curtailments or other interruptions in natural gas supply • shortages of equipment or spare parts • labor disputes including strikes work stoppages and slowdowns • the aging workforce at many of our facilities • operator errors • curtailment of operations because of transmission constraints • failures in the electricity transmission system which may cause large energy blackouts • implementation of unproven technologies in connection with environmental improvements and • catastrophic events such as fires explosions floods earthquakes hurricanes or other similar occurrences these factors could result in a material decrease or the elimination of the revenues generated by our facilities or a material increase in our costs of operations 

we operate in a limited number of markets and a significant portion of our revenues are derived from the pjm market the effect of adverse developments in our markets especially the pjm market may be greater on us than on our more geographically diversified competitors 

our generating capacity is 57 in pjm 23 in caiso 11 in nyiso and isone 8 in the southeast and 1 in miso approximately 42 and 37 of our realized gross margin during 2011 was attributable to our eastern pjm and western pjmmiso operating segments respectively adverse developments in these regions especially in the pjm market may adversely affect us further the effect of such adverse regional developments may be greater on us than on our more geographically diversified competitors 

we are exposed to possible losses that may occur from the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contractual arrangement with us particularly in connection with our noncollateralized power hedges between genon midatlantic and financial institutions 

noncollateralized power hedges with financial institutions represent 37 of our net notional power position at december 31 2011 such hedges are senior unsecured obligations of genon 

midatlantic and the counterparties and do not require either party to post cash collateral for initial margin or for securing exposure as a result of changes in power or natural gas prices deterioration in the financial condition of such counterparties could result in their failure to pay amounts owed to us or to perform obligations or services owed to us beyond collateral posted for a discussion of the genon midatlantic credit concentration risk see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a in this form 10k 

our income tax nol carry forwards could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the irc 

we have approximately 26 billion of federal nol carry forwards which we are able to use to offset taxable income in future years if however an ownership change as defined in irc § 382 occurs the amount of nols that could be used in any one year following such ownership change would be substantially limited in general an ownership change would occur when there is a greater than 50percentage point increase in ownership of a companys stock by stockholders each of which owns or is deemed to own under irc § 382 5 or more of such companys stock given irc § 382s broad definition an ownership change could be the unintended consequence of otherwise normal market trading in our stock that is outside our control moreover while we have a protective charter amendment and a stockholder rights plan in place in an effort to preserve our nols neither measure offers a complete solution and an ownership change could occur we cannot assure that the protective charter amendments restriction on acquisitions of our common stock will be enforceable against all our stockholders and the restriction may be subject to challenge the stockholder rights plan can only deter not prevent an ownership change that would result in the loss of our nols based on information contained in a shareholders recent filing made pursuant to sec regulation 13g and subsequent inquiries made on the basis of such information it is possible rri energy may have experienced an ownership change as defined above as a result of the merger as of this date we have not completed verification of the change and we continue to seek actual knowledge with respect to certain facts pertaining to the possible ownership change should we determine that rri energy had an ownership change at the merger date its nols would be substantially limited to reflect the requirements of irc § 382 see notes 7 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

regulated utilities have competitive advantages in wholesale power markets 

we compete with nonutility generators regulated utilities and other energy service companies in the sale of our products and services as well as in the procurement of fuel fuel transportation and transmission services we compete primarily on the basis of price and service regulated utilities in the wholesale markets generally enjoy a lower cost of capital than we do and often are able to recover fixed costs through regulated retail rates including in many cases the costs of generation allowing them to build buy and upgrade generating facilities without relying exclusively on marketclearing prices to recover their investments 

changes in technology may significantly affect our generating business by making our generating facilities less competitive 

we generate electricity using fossil fuels at large central facilities this method results in economies of scale and lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells microturbines windmills and photovoltaic solar cells it is possible that advances in those technologies or governmental incentives for renewable energies will reduce their costs to levels that are equal to or below that of most central station electricity production 

the expected decommissioning andor site remediation obligations of certain of our generating facilities may negatively affect our cash flows 

some of our generating facilities and related properties are subject to decommissioning andor site remediation obligations that may require material expenditures furthermore laws and regulations may change to impose material additional decommissioning and remediation obligations on us in the future 

terrorist attacks andor cyberattacks may result in our inability to operate and fulfill our obligations and could result in material repair costs 

as a power generator we face heightened risk of terrorism including cyber terrorism either by a direct act against one or more of our generating facilities or an act against the transmission and distribution infrastructure that is used to transport our power although our entire industry is exposed to these risks our generating facilities and the transmission and distribution infrastructure located in the pjm market are particularly at risk because of the proximity to major population centers including governmental and commerce centers 

we rely on information technology networks and systems to operate our generating facilities engage in asset management activities and process transmit and store electronic information security breaches of this information technology infrastructure including cyberattacks and cyber terrorism could lead to system disruptions generating facility shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information related to our employees vendors and counterparties confidential information includes banking vendor counterparty and personal identity information 

systemic damage to one or more of our generating facilities andor to the transmission and distribution infrastructure could result in our inability to operate in one or all of the markets we serve for an extended period of time if our generating facilities are shut down we would be unable to respond to the isos and rtos or fulfill our obligations under various energy andor capacity arrangements resulting in lost revenues and potential fines penalties and other liabilities pervasive cyberattacks across our industry could affect the ability of isos and rtos to function in some regions the cost to restore our generating facilities after such an occurrence could be material 

our operations are subject to hazards customary to the power generating industry we may not have adequate insurance to cover all of these hazards 

power generation involves hazardous activities including acquiring transporting and unloading fuel operating large pieces of highspeed rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems in addition to natural risks such as earthquake flood storm surge lightning hurricane tornado and wind hazards such as fire explosion collapse and machinery failure are inherent risks in our operations we are also susceptible to terrorist attacks including cyberattacks against our generating facilities or the transmission and distribution infrastructure that is used to transport our power these hazards can cause significant injury to personnel or loss of life severe damage to and destruction of property plant and equipment contamination of or damage to the environment and suspension of operations the occurrence of any one of these events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages environmental cleanup costs personal injury and fines andor penalties we do not maintain specialized insurance for possible liability resulting from a cyberattack on our systems that may shut down all or part of the transmission and distribution system however we maintain an amount of insurance protection that we consider adequate and customary for merchant power producers we cannot assure that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject 

lawsuits regulatory proceedings and tax proceedings could adversely affect our future financial results 

from time to time we are named as a party to or our property is the subject of lawsuits regulatory proceedings or tax proceedings we are currently involved in various proceedings which involve highly subjective matters with complex factual and legal questions their outcome is uncertain any claim that is successfully asserted against us could require significant expenditures by us even if we prevail any proceedings could be costly and timeconsuming could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and could result in adverse changes in our insurance costs see notes 7 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

we depend on the skills experience and efforts of our people 

the successful execution of our business strategy is dependent on the skills experience and efforts of our people the loss of one or more members of our senior management or employees with critical skills could adversely affect our future business financial condition and operating results if we were unable to secure the talent that we feel is needed 

if we acquire or develop additional facilities dispose of existing facilities or combine with other businesses we may incur additional costs and risks 

we may seek to purchase or develop additional facilities dispose of existing facilities or combine with other businesses there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful in addition these activities involve risks and challenges including identifying suitable opportunities obtaining required regulatory and other approvals integrating acquired or combined operations with our own and increasing expenses and working capital requirements furthermore in any sale we may be required to indemnify a purchaser against liabilities to finance future acquisitions we may be required to issue additional equity securities or incur additional debt obtaining such additional financing is dependent on numerous factors including general economic and capital market conditions credit availability from financial institutions the covenants in our debt agreements and our financial performance cash flow and credit ratings we cannot make any assurances that we would be able to obtain such additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

risks related to economic and financial market conditions 

we are exposed to systemic risk of the financial markets and institutions and the risk of nonperformance of the individual lenders under our undrawn credit facilities 

maintaining sufficient liquidity in our business for maintenance and operating expenditures capital expenditures and collateral is crucial in order to mitigate the risk of future financial distress to us accordingly we maintain a revolving credit facility to manage our expected liquidity needs and contingencies in the event that financial institutions are unwilling or unable to renew our existing revolving credit facility or enter into new revolving credit facilities our ability to hedge economically our assets or engage in proprietary trading could also be impaired 

we have significant undrawn availability under our revolving credit facility and marsh landing credit facility a significant portion of the marsh landing project costs are expected to be funded through drawings under the genon marsh landing credit facility the failure of the lenders to perform under our revolving credit facility or the marsh landing credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and the ability to complete construction of the marsh landing facility respectively 

see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity in item 7 of this form 10k and note 6 to our consolidated financial statements 

a negative market perception of our value could impair our ability to raise capital or refinance debt 

a sustained downturn in general economic conditions including low power and commodity prices could result in a perceived weakness in our overall financial health this may result in our stock price remaining at a low level for an extended time which would impair our ability to access equity markets 

a negative market perception of our value could result in our inability to obtain and maintain an appropriate credit rating in this event we may be unable to access debt markets or refinance future debt maturities or we may be required to post additional collateral to operate our business 

as financial institutions consolidate and operate under more restrictive capital constraints and regulations including the doddfrank act there could be less liquidity in the energy and commodity markets for hedge transactions and fewer creditworthy counterparties 

we hedge economically a substantial portion of our pjm coalfired baseload generation and certain of our other generation a significant portion of our hedges are financial swap transactions between genon midatlantic and financial counterparties that are senior unsecured obligations of such parties and do not require either party to post cash collateral either for initial margin or for securing exposure as a result of changes in power or natural gas prices global financial institutions have been active participants in these energy and commodity markets as global financial institutions consolidate and operate under more restrictive capital constraints and regulations including the doddfrank act there could be less liquidity in the energy and commodity markets which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to hedge economically and transact with creditworthy counterparties 

the doddfrank act could materially affect our business including greater regulation of energy contracts and otc derivative financial instruments which could materially and adversely affect our ability to hedge economically our generation and engage in proprietary trading 

the doddfrank act which was enacted in july 2010 in response to the global financial crisis increases the regulation of transactions involving otc derivative financial instruments the effect of the doddfrank act on our business depends in large measure on pending rulemaking proceedings of the cftc the sec and the federal banking regulators under the doddfrank act entities defined as swap dealers and major swap participants will face costly requirements for clearing and posting margin as well as additional requirements for reporting and business conduct although we do not expect our commercial activity to result in our designation as an sdmsp as proposed the swap dealer definition in particular is ambiguous subjective and could be broad enough to encompass some energy companies it is possible that the final rule will not offer much clarity and the designation as an sdmsp could be decided by facts and circumstance tests the impact of the final regulations or the uncertainty as to the scope thereof could have a material adverse effect on our commercial activities and our ability to hedge economically including decreasing liquidity in the forward commodity markets 

many of the factors that cause changes in commodity prices are outside our control and may materially increase our cost of producing power or lower the price at which we are able to sell our power 

our generating business is subject to changes in power prices and fuel and emissions costs and these commodity prices are influenced by many factors outside our control including weather seasonal variation in supply and demand market liquidity transmission and transportation inefficiencies availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources demand for energy commodities production of natural gas coal and crude oil natural disasters wars embargoes and other catastrophic events and federal state and environmental regulation and legislation in addition significant fluctuations in the price of natural gas may cause significant fluctuations in the price of electricity significant fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our financial results and financial position by increasing the cost of producing power and decreasing the amounts we receive from the sale of power 

our hedging activities will not fully protect us from fluctuations in commodity prices 

we engage in hedging activities related to sales of electricity and purchases of fuel and emission allowances the income and losses from these activities are recorded as operating revenues and fuel costs we may use forward contracts and other derivative financial instruments to manage market risk and exposure to volatility in prices of electricity coal natural gas emissions and oil the effectiveness of these hedges is dependent upon the correlation between the forward contracts and the other derivative financial instruments used as a hedge and the market risk of the asset or assets being hedged we cannot provide assurance that these strategies will be successful in managing our price risks or that they will not result in net losses to us as a result of future volatility in electricity fuel and emissions markets actual power prices and fuel costs may differ from our expectations 

our hedging activities include natural gas derivative financial instruments that we use to hedge economically power prices for our baseload generation the effectiveness of these hedges is dependent upon the correlation between power and natural gas prices in the markets where we operate if those prices are not sufficiently correlated our financial results and financial position could be adversely affected see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a of this form 10k 

additionally we expect to have an open position in the market within our established guidelines resulting from our proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities to the extent open positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can affect our financial results and financial position either favorably or unfavorably as a result of these and other factors we cannot predict the outcome that risk management decisions may have on our business operating results or financial position although management devotes considerable attention to these issues their outcome is uncertain 

our policies and procedures cannot eliminate the risks associated with our hedging and proprietary trading activities 

the risk management procedures we have in place may not always be followed or may not always work as planned if any of our employees were able to violate our system of internal controls including our risk management policy and engage in unauthorized hedging and related activities it could result in significant penalties and financial losses in addition risk management tools and metrics such as value at risk gross margin at risk and stress testing are partially based on historic price movements if price movements significantly or persistently deviate from historical behavior risk limits may not fully protect us from significant losses 

our hedging proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities may increase the volatility of our gaap financial results 

derivatives from our hedging proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value pursuant to the accounting guidance for derivative financial instruments other than interest rate swaps into which we entered to manage our interest rate risk associated with our genon marsh landing project financing none of our other derivatives recorded at fair value is designated as a hedge under this guidance and changes in their fair values currently are recognized in earnings as unrealized gains or losses as a result our gaap financial results—including gross margin operating income and balance sheet ratios—will at times be volatile and subject to fluctuations in value primarily because of changes in forward electricity and fuel prices see notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

risks related to governmental regulation and laws 

our costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant and can affect our future operations and financial results 

we are subject to extensive and evolving environmental regulations particularly in regard to our coal and oilfired facilities environmental laws particularly with respect to air emissions disposal of ash wastewater discharge and cooling water systems are generally becoming more stringent which may require us to make additional facility upgrades or restrict our operations failure to comply with environmental requirements could require us to shut down or reduce production at our facilities or create liabilities we incur significant costs in complying with these regulations and if we fail to comply could incur significant penalties our cost estimates for environmental compliance are based on existing regulations or our view of reasonably likely regulations and our assessment of the costs of labor and materials and the state of evolving technologies our decision to make these investments is often subject to future market conditions changes to the preceding factors new or revised environmental regulations litigation and new legislation andor regulations as well as other factors could cause our actual costs to vary outside the range of our estimates further constrain our operations increase our environmental compliance costs andor make it uneconomical to operate some of our facilities see business segments above for a discussion of coalfired generating facilities that we expect to deactivate between 2012 and 2015 

federal state and regional initiatives to regulate greenhouse gas emissions could have a material impact on our financial performance and condition the actual impact will depend on a number of factors including the overall level of greenhouse gas reductions required under any such regulations the final form of the regulations or legislation and the price and availability of emissions allowances if allowances are a part of any final regulatory framework 

we are required to surrender emissions allowances equal to emissions of specific substances to operate our facilities surrender requirements may require purchase of allowances which may be unavailable or only available at costs that would make it uneconomical to operate our facilities 

certain environmental laws including cercla and comparable state laws impose strict and in many circumstances joint and several liability for costs of remediating contamination some of our facilities have areas with known soil andor groundwater contamination we could be required to spend significant sums to remediate contamination regardless of whether we caused such contamination a if there are releases or discoveries of hazardous substances at our generating facilities at disposal sites we currently use or have used or at other locations for which we may be liable or b if parties contractually responsible to us for contamination fail to or are unable to respond when claims or obligations regarding such contamination arise 

under current and forecasted market conditions capital expenditures required by our permit for the shawville facility are not economic 

our npdes permit requires installation of cooling towers or reduction in plant operation by july 2015 at our leased shawville facility accordingly we plan to place the coalfired units at the shawville facility which is leased in a longterm protective layup in april 2015 under the lease agreement for shawville our obligations generally are to pay the required rent and to maintain the leased assets in accordance with the lease documentation including in compliance with prudent competitive electric generating industry practice and applicable laws we will continue to evaluate our options under the lease including termination of the lease for economic obsolescence andor keeping the facility in longterm protective layup during the term of the lease we do not think that the lease documentation mandates that we operate the facility continuously and so long as we are not operating it we do not think that the installation of cooling towers emissions controls and other expenditures would be required under the lease documentation during the longterm protective layup of the shawville facility 

we would continue to pay the required rent and to maintain the facility as required by the lease in the event of an early termination we would seek a termination for obsolescence under the lease agreement and could be required to make a termination payment equal to the difference between the termination value and the proceeds received in connection with the sale of the facility to a thirdparty together with such other amounts if any required under the lease at december 31 2011 the total notional minimum lease payments for the remaining terms of the lease aggregated 203 million and the aggregate termination value for the lease was 218 million we could have impairment charges related to our shawville facility leasehold improvements at december 31 2011 we have leasehold improvements relating to this facility of 28 million recorded in property plant and equipment in our consolidated balance sheet 

our coalfired generating units produce certain byproducts that involve extensive handling and disposal costs and are subject to government regulation changes in these regulations or their administration by legislatures state and federal regulatory agencies or other bodies may affect the costs of handling and disposing of these byproducts 

as a result of the coal combustion process we produce significant quantities of ash at our coalfired generating units that must be disposed of at sites permitted to handle ash one of our landfills in maryland has reached design capacity and we expect that another one of our sites in maryland may reach full capacity in the next few years as a result we are developing new ash management facilities and have constructed a facility to prepare ash from certain of our maryland facilities for beneficial uses however the costs associated with developing new ash management facilities could be material and the amount of time to complete such developments could extend beyond the time when new facilities are needed likewise the new facility for preparing ash for beneficial uses may not operate as expected or the ash may not be marketed and sold as expected additionally costs associated with thirdparty ash handling and disposal are material and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance and condition 

we also produce gypsum as a byproduct of the so 2 scrubbing process at our coalfired generating facilities much of which is sold to third parties for use in drywall production should our ability to sell such gypsum to third parties be restricted as a result of the lack of demand or otherwise our gypsum disposal costs could rise materially 

the epa has proposed two alternatives for regulating byproducts such as ash and gypsum one of these alternatives would regulate these byproducts as special wastes in a manner similar to the regulation of hazardous wastes if these byproducts are regulated as special wastes the cost of disposing of these byproducts would increase materially and may limit our ability to recycle them for beneficial use 

our business is subject to complex government regulations changes in these regulations or their administration by legislatures state and federal regulatory agencies or other bodies may affect the prices at which we are able to sell the electricity we produce the costs of operating our generating facilities or our ability to operate our facilities 

the majority of our generation is sold at market prices under marketbased rate authority granted by the ferc if certain conditions are not met the ferc has the authority to withhold or rescind marketbased rate authority and require sales to be made based on costofservice rates a loss of our marketbased rate authority could have a materially negative impact on our generating business 

even when marketbased rate authority has been granted the ferc may impose various forms of market mitigation measures including price caps and operating restrictions when it determines that potential market power might exist and that the public interest requires such potential market power to be mitigated in addition to direct regulation by the ferc most of our facilities are subject to rules 

and terms of participation imposed and administered by various isos and rtos although these entities are themselves ultimately regulated by the ferc they can impose rules restrictions and terms of service that are quasiregulatory in nature and can have a material adverse impact on our business for example isos and rtos may impose bidding and scheduling rules both to curb the potential exercise of market power and to ensure market functions such actions may materially affect our ability to sell and the price we receive for our energy capacity and ancillary services 

to conduct our business we must obtain and periodically renew licenses permits and approvals for our facilities these licenses permits and approvals can be in addition to any required environmental permits no assurance can be provided that we will be able to obtain and comply with all necessary licenses permits and approvals for these facilities 

conflicts may occur between reliability needs and environmental rules particularly with increasingly stringent environmental restrictions without a consent decree or adjustments to permit requirements which require long lead times to obtain we remain subject to environmental penalties or liabilities that may occur as a result of operating in compliance with reliability requirements further we could be subject to citizen suits in these types of circumstances even if we have received a consent decree or permit adjustment exempting us from environmental requirements 

we cannot predict whether the federal or state legislatures will adopt legislation relating to the restructuring of the energy industry there are proposals in many jurisdictions that would either roll back or advance the movement toward competitive markets for the supply of electricity at both the wholesale and retail levels in addition any future legislation favoring large vertically integrated utilities and a concentration of ownership of such utilities could affect our ability to compete successfully and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected similarly any regulations or laws that favor new generation over existing generation could adversely affect our business 

risks related to level of indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness and operating lease obligations could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting or refinancing our obligations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness at december 31 2011 our consolidated indebtedness was 41 billion in addition the present values of lease payments under the respective genon midatlantic and rema operating leases were approximately 881 million and 466 million respectively assuming a 10 and 94 discount rate respectively and the termination value of the respective genon midatlantic and rema operating leases was 13 billion and 735 million respectively 

our substantial indebtedness and operating lease obligations could have important consequences for our liquidity results of operations financial position and prospects including our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy these consequences include the following 

• they may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes • a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations must be dedicated to the payment of rent and principal and interest on our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes including for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 41 

• the debt service requirements of our indebtedness and our lease obligations could make it difficult for us to satisfy or refinance our financial obligations • certain of our borrowings including borrowings under our senior secured credit facility are at variable rates of interest exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates • they may limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our industry • they may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other less leveraged competitors • our new credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interest and • we may be more vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business and we may be unable to carry out capital expenditures that are important to our longterm growth or necessary to comply with environmental regulations genon and its subsidiaries that are holding companies including genon americas generation may not have access to sufficient cash to meet their obligations if their subsidiaries in particular genon midatlantic are unable to make distributions 

we and certain of our subsidiaries including genon americas generation and genon americas are holding companies and as a result are dependent upon dividends distributions and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations in particular a substantial portion of the cash from our operations is generated by genon midatlantic the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make distributions is restricted under the terms of their debt or other agreements including the operating leases of genon midatlantic and rema under their respective operating leases genon midatlantic and rema are not permitted to make any distributions and other restricted payments unless a they satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters b they are projected to satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for each of the two following periods of four fiscal quarters commencing with the fiscal quarter in which such payment is proposed to be made and c no significant lease default or event of default has occurred and is continuing in the event of a default under the respective operating leases or if the respective restricted payment tests are not satisfied genon midatlantic and rema would not be able to distribute cash at december 31 2011 genon midatlantic satisfied the restricted payments test at december 31 2011 rema did not satisfy the restricted payments test 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and leases and to post required amounts of cash collateral necessary to hedge economically market risk 

our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and the rent on our leases depends on our future operating performance if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to allow us to make scheduled payments on our debt we may have to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital restructure or refinance there can be no assurance that the terms of our debt or leases will allow these alternative measures that the financial markets will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such measures would satisfy our scheduled debt service and lease rent obligations if we do not comply with the payment and other material covenants under our debt and lease agreements we could default under our debt or leases and in the case of our revolving credit facilities the commitment to lend us money could terminate 

our asset management activities may require us to post collateral either in the form of cash or letters of credit at december 31 2011 we had approximately 224 million of posted cash collateral and 265 million of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility primarily to support our asset management activities trading activities rent reserve requirements and other commercial arrangements see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our 

posted cash collateral and letters of credit although we seek to structure transactions in a way that reduces our potential liquidity needs for collateral we may be unable to execute our hedging strategy successfully if we are unable to post the amount of collateral required to enter into and support hedging contracts 

we are an active participant in energy exchange and clearing markets which require a percontract initial margin to be posted the initial margins are determined by the exchanges through the use of proprietary models that rely on a variety of inputs and factors including market conditions we have limited notice of any changes to the margin rates consequently we are exposed to changes in the per unit margin rates required by the exchanges and could be required to post additional collateral on short notice 

the terms of our credit facilities and leases restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or take certain actions 

our credit facilities and leases contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to 

• incur additional indebtedness • pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock • prepay redeem or repurchase certain debt • make loans and investments • sell assets • incur liens • enter into transactions with affiliates • enter into saleleaseback transactions and • consolidate merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets in addition the restrictive covenants in our credit facilities require us to maintain a ratio of consolidated secured debt net of up to 500 million in cash and certain collateral assets and deposits to ebitda of not more than 350 to 100 which will be tested at the end of each fiscal quarter and in the case of ebitda will be calculated on a rolling four fiscal quarter basis ending on the last day of such fiscal quarter our ability to meet that financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control our failure to comply with the covenants in our credit facilities could result in an event of default under our credit facilities and any other debt to which a crossdefault or crossacceleration provision applies

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this section is intended to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements the changes in those financial statements from year to year and the primary factors contributing to those changes the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes accompanying those financial statements 

merger of mirant and rri energy 

on december 3 2010 mirant and rri energy completed their merger mirant merged with a whollyowned subsidiary of rri energy with mirant surviving the merger as a whollyowned subsidiary of rri energy in connection with the allstock taxfree merger rri energy changed its name to genon energy inc mirant stockholders received a fixed ratio of 2835 shares of genon common stock for each share of mirant common stock and mirant changed its name to genon energy holdings 

although rri energy was the legal acquirer the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition and mirant was deemed to have acquired rri energy for accounting purposes as a consequence of the reverse acquisition accounting treatment the historical financial statements presented for periods prior to the merger date are the historical statements of mirant except for stockholders equity which has been retroactively adjusted for the equivalent number of shares of the legal acquirer the operations of the former rri energy businesses have been included in the financial statements from the date of the merger for a discussion of our strategy see item 1 business—strategy in this form 10k 

we have achieved 160 million in annual cost savings through reductions in corporate overhead and support costs these cost savings resulted from consolidations in several areas including headquarters it systems and corporate functions such as accounting human resources and finance we have estimated the total mergerrelated costs at approximately 225 million these costs include 85 million of advisory and legal fees and 140 million of other mergerrelated costs including costs to achieve the savings these amounts include 25 million incurred by rri energy prior to the merger during 2011 and 2010 we incurred 72 million and 114 million respectively we expect to incur approximately 8 million and 6 million during 2012 and 2013 and beyond respectively see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

our business 

we are a wholesale generator with approximately 23700 mw of net electric generating capacity located in many cases near major metropolitan load centers in the pjm miso northeast and southeast regions and california we also operate integrated asset management and proprietary trading operations our customers are principally isos rtos and investorowned utilities 

see above in item 1 business for a discussion of our expectations to deactivate some generating facilities primarily coalfired facilities of approximately 3140 mws between 2012 and 2015 as well as our other fleet reductions also see environmental matters below in connection with these deactivations we expect to incur some charges beginning in the first quarter of 2012 we are currently determining the appropriate amounts for these charges which include writeoffs for excess materials and supplies inventory severance and other plant closure costs 

our commercial operations consist primarily of dispatching electricity hedging the price of electricity we expect to generate selling capacity procuring and managing fuel and providing logistical support for the operation of our facilities for example by procuring transportation for coal and natural gas as well as our proprietary trading operations 

we typically sell the electricity we produce into the wholesale market at prices in effect at the time we produce it spot price we use dispatch models to assist in making daily bidding decisions regarding the quantity and price of the power we offer to generate from our facilities and sell into the markets we bid the energy from our generating facilities into the hourahead or dayahead energy market and sell ancillary services through the iso and rto markets we work with the isos and rtos in real time to ensure that our generating facilities are dispatched economically to meet the reliability needs of the market 

spot prices for electricity are volatile as are prices for fuel and emissions allowances in order to reduce the risk of price volatility and achieve more predictable financial results we have historically entered into economic hedges—forward sales of electricity and forward purchases of fuel and emissions allowances to permit us to produce and sell the electricity—to manage the risks associated with such volatility in addition given the high correlation between natural gas prices and electricity prices in many of the markets in which we operate we have entered into forward sales of natural gas to hedge economically our exposure to changes in the price of electricity we procure our hedges in otc transactions or on exchanges where electricity fuel and emissions allowances are broadly traded or through specific transactions with buyers and sellers using futures forwards swaps and options our hedges cover various periods including several years 

we sell capacity either bilaterally or through periodic auctions in each iso and rto market in which we participate these capacity sales provide an important source of predictable revenues for us over the contracted period at january 24 2012 total projected contracted capacity and ppa revenues for which prices have been set for 2012 through 2015 are 30 billion failure to meet our capacity commitments may result in a reduction to our capacity payments through penalties or charges 

in addition to the activities described above we buy and sell some electricity fuel and emissions allowances sometimes through financial derivatives as part of our proprietary trading fuel oil management and natural gas transportation and storage activities we engage in proprietary trading to gain information about the markets in which we operate to support our asset management and to take advantage of selected opportunities that we identify we enter into fuel oil management activities to hedge economically the fair value of our physical fuel oil inventories optimize the approximately two million barrels of storage capacity that we own as well as attempt to profit from market opportunities related to timing andor differences in the pricing of various products we engage in natural gas transportation and storage activities to optimize our physical natural gas and storage positions and manage the physical gas requirements for a portion of our assets proprietary trading fuel oil management and natural gas transportation and storage activities together will typically comprise less than 5 of our realized gross margin all of our commercial activities are governed by a comprehensive risk management policy which includes limits on the size of volumetric positions and var for our proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities 

hedging activities 

we hedge economically a substantial portion of our pjm coalfired baseload generation and certain of our other generation we generally do not hedge our intermediate and peaking units for tenors greater than 12 months we hedge economically using products which we expect to be effective to mitigate the price risk of our generation however as a result of market liquidity limitations our hedges often are not an exact match for the generation being hedged and we have some risks resulting from price differentials for different delivery points in addition we have risks for implied differences in heat rates when we hedge economically power using natural gas currently a significant portion of our hedges are financial swap transactions between genon midatlantic and financial counterparties that are senior unsecured obligations of such parties and do not require either party to post cash collateral either for initial margin or for securing exposure as a result of changes in power or natural gas prices at january 24 2012 our aggregate hedge levels based on expected generation for each year were as follows 



1 percentages represent the period from february through december 2012 

see item 1a risk factors—risks related to economic and financial market conditions for a discussion of 

• the risks of consolidation of financial institutions and more restrictive capital constraints and regulation which could have a negative effect on our ability to hedge economically with creditworthy counterparties and • the risks of implementation of the doddfrank act on our ability to hedge economically our generation including potentially reducing liquidity in the energy and commodity markets and if we are required to clear such transactions on exchanges or meet other requirements by significantly increasing the collateral costs associated with such activities capital expenditures and capital resources 

for 2011 we invested 436 million for capital expenditures excluding capitalized interest paid capital expenditures for 2011 primarily relate to the construction of the marsh landing generating facility maintenance capital expenditures the construction of an ash beneficiation facility and include the 68 million payment to stone  webster for substantial completion of the maryland scrubber projects at december 31 2011 we have invested 1591 billion of the 1674 billion that was budgeted for capital expenditures related to compliance with the maryland healthy air act provisions in the construction contracts for the scrubbers at our maryland coalfired units provide for certain payments to be made after final completion of the projects assuming we are successful in pursuing our claims in the new york proceeding the total estimated capital expenditures for compliance with the maryland healthy air act would not exceed the 1674 billion we currently have recorded however if the costs were to equal the amount claimed by stone webster in the litigation the total capital expenditures would exceed 1674 billion by approximately 5 see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion involving the scrubber contract litigation 

the following table details the expected timing of payments for our estimated capital expenditures excluding capitalized interest not related to the marsh landing generating facility for 2012 and 2013 



we expect that available cash and future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund these capital expenditures we plan to fund a substantial portion of the total capital expenditures for the marsh landing generating facility pursuant to the genon marsh landing project financing facility entered into in october 2010 other environmental capital expenditures set forth above could significantly increase subject to the content and timing of final rules and future market conditions 

environmental matters 

we decide to invest capital for environmental controls based on relatively certain regulations an evaluation of various options for regulatory compliance including different technologies and fuel modification and the expected economic returns on the capital as discussed above in business segments we recently analyzed the investment in environmental controls required for a number of our facilities primarily coalfired facilities and concluded that the forecasted returns on investments necessary to comply with environmental regulations are insufficient accordingly we expect to deactivate the following facilities glen gardner niles elrama mothball then retire new castle titus portland and shawville longterm protective layup likewise we expect other industry participants to retire coalfired generating facilities because of the costs associated with more stringent environmental air and water quality requirements some of which have already been announced these seven generating facilities along with our avon lake facility contributed 13 to our realized gross margin during 2011 

we expect industry retirements of coalfired generating facilities to contribute to a tightening of supply and demand fundamentals and higher prices for the remaining generating facilities consequently we expect the resulting higher market prices to provide adequate returns on some investment in environmental controls necessary to meet promulgated and anticipated requirements accordingly we expect to invest approximately 586 million to 726 million over the next ten years for scrs and other major environmental controls to meet certain air and water quality requirements 

which we expect to fund from existing sources of liquidity the following table summarizes our expected investment in major environmental controls over the next ten years 



1 based on our leased interest in the conemaugh facility 2 for chalk point unit 2 

if market power prices rise even higher than our current expectations we might invest more than 726 million for major environmental controls if they provide adequate expected returns on investment in particular we are continuing to evaluate the viability of environmental controls for our avon lake facility 732 mw our initial analysis indicates that forecasted returns on such investments are insufficient and we anticipate retiring the coalfired units at the avon lake facility in 2015 the decision with respect to avon lake is influenced in part by retirement decisions announced by other companies that we are continuing to evaluate the decision to invest in environmental controls for avon lake requires us to look not only at the cost of the scrubber to comply with mats but also the costs to comply with expected future regulations including more stringent pm 25 and ozone naaqs and water regulations an investment in a scrubber an scr and water intake screens would be approximately 500 million during the period between 2013 and 2020 

given the uncertainty related to these environmental matters and those discussed or referred to in this form 10k we cannot predict their actual outcome or ultimate effect on our business and such matters could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows see business—regulatory environment—environmental regulation and risk factors—risks related to governmental regulation and laws in items 1 and 1a respectively of this form 10k and note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

commodity prices 

the prices for power and natural gas are low compared to several years ago the energy gross margin from our baseload coal units is negatively affected by these price levels for that portion of the volumes of generation that we have hedged we are generally unaffected by subsequent changes in commodity prices because our realized gross margin will reflect the contractual prices of our power and fuel contracts we continue to add economic hedges to manage the risks associated with volatility in prices and to achieve more predictable realized gross margin however we expect realized gross margin will be lower in 2012 compared with 2011 

results of operations 

upon completion of the merger mirant stockholders had a majority of the voting interest in the combined company although rri energy issued shares of rri energy common stock to mirant stockholders to effect the merger the merger is accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting under the acquisition method of accounting mirant is treated as the accounting acquirer and rri energy is treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes as such our consolidated financial statements and results below of genon include the results of the combined entities for the periods from december 3 2010 and include the results of mirant through december 2 2010 the consolidated financial statements presented herein for periods ended prior to the closing of the merger and any other financial information presented herein with respect to such premerger dates unless otherwise specified are the consolidated financial statements and other financial information of mirant 

nongaap performance measures the following discussion includes the nongaap financial measures realized gross margin and unrealized gross margin to reflect how we manage our business in our discussion of the results of our reportable segments we include the components of realized gross margin which are energy contracted and capacity and realized value of hedges management generally evaluates our operating results excluding the impact of unrealized gains and losses when viewed with our gaap financial results these nongaap financial measures may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business realized gross margin represents our gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization less unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments conversely unrealized gross margin represents our unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments none of our derivative financial instruments recorded at fair value is designated as a hedge other than our interest rate swaps and changes in their fair values are recognized currently in income as unrealized gains or losses as a result our financial results are at times volatile and subject to fluctuations in value primarily because of changes in forward electricity and fuel prices realized gross margin together with its components energy contracted and capacity and realized value of hedges provide a measure of performance that eliminates the volatility reflected in unrealized gross margin which is created by significant shifts in market values between periods 

we also disclose the nongaap financial measures adjusted incomeloss from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda as consolidated performance measures which exclude unrealized gross margin these are also provided on a pro forma basis for 2010 as indicated above management generally evaluates our operating results excluding the effect of unrealized gains and losses adjusted incomeloss from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda also exclude as applicable a mergerrelated costs b net lower of cost or market adjustments to our commodity inventories c impairment losses d gainloss on early extinguishment of debt e western states litigation and similar settlements f large scale remediation and settlement costs g major litigation costs net of recoveries h postretirement benefits curtailment gain i reversal of the montgomery county carbon levy assessment for the prior year and j certain other items we adjust for the subsequent benefit created by commodity inventory utilized in operations that were subject to prior period lower of cost or market adjustments we exclude or adjust for these items to provide a more meaningful representation of our ongoing results of operations 

we use these nongaap financial measures in communications with investors analysts rating agencies banks and other parties adjusted ebitda is a key performance metric in our employee incentive compensation structure for annual bonuses we think these nongaap financial measures provide meaningful representations of our consolidated operating performance and are useful to us and others in facilitating the analysis of our results of operations from one period to another we view adjusted ebitda as providing a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures capital investment cycles and ages of assets among otherwise comparable companies we 

encourage our investors to review our financial statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure 

the foregoing nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled nongaap financial measures used by other companies 

2011 compared to 2010 

consolidated financial performance 

we reported net losses of 189 million and 233 million for 2011 and 2010 respectively the change in net loss is detailed as follows 



realized gross margin our realized gross margin increase of 431 million was principally a result of the following 

• an increase of 324 million in contracted and capacity primarily as a result of 283 million from our western pjmmiso segment which was formed as a result of the merger and a 79 million increase in capacity revenues in our california segment partially offset by a decrease of 43 million primarily resulting from lower capacity prices in our eastern pjm segment and the shutdown of the potrero generating facility in our california segment • an increase of 65 million in energy primarily as a result of 248 million from our western pjmmiso segment which was formed as a result of the merger partially offset by a decrease in generation volumes in eastern pjm primarily as a result of contracting dark spreads and spark spreads and • an increase of 42 million in realized value of hedges primarily as a result of 58 million from our western pjmmiso segment which was formed as a result of the merger and an increase 55 

in coal hedges primarily as a result of prices partially offset by a decrease in power hedges as a result of prices 

unrealized gross margin our unrealized gross margin for both periods reflects the following 

• unrealized gains of 224 million in 2011 which included a 466 million net increase in the value of hedge and proprietary trading contracts for future periods primarily related to decreases in forward power and natural gas prices offset by 242 million associated with the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from power and fuel contracts that settled during the period and • unrealized losses of 42 million in 2010 which included 389 million associated with the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from power and fuel contracts that settled during the period offset by a 347 million net increase in the value of hedge and proprietary trading contracts for future periods the increase in value was primarily related to decreases in forward power and natural gas prices offset in part by the recognition of many of our coal agreements at fair value beginning in the second quarter of 2010 operating expenses our operating expenses increase of 164 million was principally a result of the following 

• an increase of 447 million in operations and maintenance expense primarily related to the following • an increase of 569 million related to the addition of the rri energy generating facilities and corporate costs as a result of the merger • a 49 million accrual for remediation costs at our maryland ash facilities which includes a tentative 19 million civil penalty • 37 million curtailment gain recognized in 2010 resulting from an amendment to our postretirement healthcare benefits plan covering certain of our eastern pjm union employees see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements and • 15 million recognized in 2011 for major litigation costs net of recoveries • a 10 million accrual for the brandywine storm damage and remediation partially offset by • a decrease of 42 million in mergerrelated costs • a decrease of 38 million related to outages and some labor costs • 32 million recognized in 2010 related to a liability associated with our commitment to reduce particulate emissions at our potomac river generating facility as a part of the agreement with the city of alexandria virginia see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements • 24 million recognized in 2010 for the accelerated vesting of mirants stockbased compensation as a result of the merger and • a decrease of 17 million as a result of the repeal of the montgomery county co 2 levy including 8 million related to a refund received in 2011 of co 2 levies paid in 2010 • an increase of 151 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily as a result of the addition of the longlived assets acquired in the merger partially offset by decreases as a result of reductions in the carrying values of the dickerson and potomac river generating facilities as a result of impairment losses in 2010 and the shutdown of the potrero generating facility and 56 

• a decrease of 432 million in impairment losses in 2011 we recognized 133 million in impairment losses for the writeoff of excess no x and so 2 emissions allowances as a result of the csapr in 2010 we recognized 565 million in impairment losses related to our dickerson and potomac river generating facilities see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements gain on bargain purchase we reported a gain on bargain purchase of 335 million as retroactively amended during 2010 the gain on the bargain purchase is primarily a result of differences between the longterm fundamental value of the generating facilities and the effect of the nearterm view of the equity markets on the price of mirant common stock at the close of the merger see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements the merger is accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations accordingly we have conducted an assessment of the net assets acquired and recognized amounts for identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values while transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition are expensed as incurred 

interest expense net interest expense net increase of 126 million was primarily a result of the following 

• a 245 million increase related to interest incurred on our senior notes and credit facilities and interest expense on debt assumed in the merger partially offset by • a 123 million decrease related to lower interest expense as a result of a repayment of the genon north america senior secured credit facilities and senior notes in 2010 and 2011 respectively and b repayment of genon americas generation senior unsecured notes in 2011 other net other net change of 26 million was primarily a result of the following 

• 23 million of other expense relating to the loss on early extinguishment of debt primarily related to a 16 million premium and a 7 million writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the genon north america senior notes that were repaid in 2011 and • 14 million of other income recognized in accordance with accounting guidance relating to the reimbursement of premerger interest paid by rri energy on genons debt in accordance with the premerger escrow arrangements in 2010 partially offset by • 9 million of other expense relating to the writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the genon north america senior secured term loan that was repaid in 2010 adjusted incomeloss from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda the following table reconciles the nongaap consolidated performance measures adjusted incomeloss from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda to net incomeloss on historical and pro forma bases see the discussion above regarding the significant items excluded or adjusted in arriving at the nongaap measures in the table below in order to provide a more meaningful comparison of our results the following compares actual results for 2011 to pro forma information for 2010 and provides discussion of the changes the unaudited pro forma information is based on the historical consolidated financial statements of both rri energy and mirant and has been prepared to illustrate the effects of the merger assuming the merger had been consummated on january 1 2010 the unaudited pro forma information primarily includes the following adjustments among others 

• amortization of fair value adjustments related to energyrelated contracts • additional fuel expense related to fair value adjustments of fuel inventories • effects of fair value adjustments of property plant and equipment • effects of fair value adjustments of debt and the issuance of a new revolving credit facility new senior secured term loan and new senior unsecured notes and 57 

• adjustments to income taxes for a zero percent rate applied to the pro forma adjustments and historical federal and state deferred tax expensebenefit the unaudited pro forma results exclude 

• mergerrelated costs because these costs reflect nonrecurring charges directly related to the merger and • cost savings from operating efficiencies or synergies that we expect to result from the merger the pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have occurred if the merger had been completed at the date indicated nor is it indicative of our future operating results 



1 during 2010 rri energy recognized a impairment losses of 361 million for its elrama niles titus and new castle generating facilities and b 17 million to settle the western states and other litigation 

adjusted ebitda was 622 million for 2011 compared to 919 million on a pro forma basis for 2010 the decline primarily was related to a reduction in energy gross margin in eastern pjm as a result of reduced generation volumes and lower contracted and capacity revenues the decline was partially offset by lower adjusted operating and other expenses primarily related to merger cost savings and reduced planned outages and projects 

the adjusted loss from continuing operations was 132 million for 2011 compared to adjusted income from continuing operations of 103 million on a pro forma basis for 2010 the decline was primarily related to the same items that affected adjusted ebitda partially offset by a reduction in interest expense net and depreciation and amortization expense 

our net loss was 189 million for 2011 compared to 740 million on a pro forma basis for 2010 the decrease in net loss was primarily a result of a 793 million decrease in impairment losses and an increase in unrealized gross margin partially offset by mergerrelated costs 59 million recognized in 2011 for large scale remediation and settlement costs and the same items that affected adjusted incomeloss from continuing operations 

segments 

the following discussion of our performance is organized by reportable segment which is consistent with the way we manage our business in conjunction with the merger we began reporting in five segments eastern pjm western pjmmiso california energy marketing and other operations prior to the merger we had four reportable segments midatlantic northeast california and other operations amounts for 2010 were reclassified to conform to the current segment presentation 

gross margin overview 

the following tables detail realized and unrealized gross margin by operating segments 



  



1 gross margin excludes depreciation and amortization 

energy represents gross margin from the generation of electricity fuel sales and purchases at market prices fuel handling steam sales our proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities and natural gas transportation and storage activities 

contracted and capacity represents gross margin received from capacity sold in iso and rto administered capacity markets through rmr contracts which we had at potrero through february 28 2011 through ppas and tolling agreements and from ancillary services 

realized value of hedges represents the actual margin upon the settlement of our power and fuel hedging contracts and the difference between market prices and contract costs for fuel power hedging contracts include sales of both power and natural gas used to hedge power prices as well as hedges to capture the incremental value related to the geographic location of our physical assets 

unrealized gross margin represents the net unrealized gain or loss on our derivative contracts including the reversal of unrealized gains and losses recognized in prior periods and changes in value for future periods 

operating statistics 

our total margin capture factor was 89 during 2011 

the following table summarizes power generation volumes by segment 



1 negative amounts denote net energy used by the generating facility 2 nm means not meaningful 

the total increase in power generation volumes for 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily the result of the following 

eastern pjm the decrease in our baseload and intermediate generation volumes was primarily as a result of contracting dark spreads and spark spreads 

western pjmmiso the western pjmmiso segment was added as a result of the merger 

california the decrease in our intermediate generation volumes was primarily the result of the shutdown of the potrero generating facility partially offset by the addition of the rri energy generating facilities as a result of the merger 

other operations the increase in our baseload and peaking generation volumes was primarily related to the addition of the rri energy generating facilities as a result of the merger offset in part by a reduction in our available capacity at the bowline and kendall generating facilities 

eastern pjm 

our eastern pjm segment includes eight generating facilities with total net generating capacity of 6341 mw at december 31 2011 and 2010 

the following table summarizes the results of operations of our eastern pjm segment 



gross margin 

the decrease of 266 million in realized gross margin was principally a result of the following 

• a decrease of 217 million in energy primarily as a result of a decrease in generation volumes as a result of contracting dark spreads and spark spreads • a decrease of 43 million in contracted and capacity primarily as a result of an 85 million decrease from lower capacity prices and an 8 million decrease from ancillary services offset by 47 million from the addition of the rri energy generating facilities as a result of the merger and • a decrease of 6 million in realized value of hedges primarily as a result of a 37 million decrease in power hedges primarily resulting from prices offset in part by a 28 million increase in our coal hedges resulting from prices 61 

our unrealized gross margin for both periods reflects the following 

• unrealized gains of 120 million in 2011 which included a 338 million net increase in the value of hedge contracts for future periods primarily related to decreases in forward power and natural gas prices partially offset by 218 million associated with the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from power and fuel contracts that settled during the period and • unrealized gains of 7 million in 2010 which included a 326 million net increase in the value of hedge contracts for future periods primarily related to decreases in forward power and natural gas prices offset in part by the recognition of many of our coal agreements at fair value beginning in the second quarter of 2010 the increase in value was substantially offset by 319 million associated with the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from power and fuel contracts that settled during the period operating expenses 

the decrease of 11 billion in operating expenses was principally a result of the following 

• a decrease of 11 billion in impairment losses in 2011 we recognized 95 million in impairment losses for the writeoff of excess no x and so 2 emissions allowances as a result of the csapr in 2010 we recognized 12 billion in impairment losses including 616 million related to the writeoff of goodwill recorded at our genon midatlantic registrant on its standalone balance sheet and 537 million related to our dickerson and potomac river generating facilities the goodwill impairment loss was eliminated upon consolidation at genon north america see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements and • a decrease of 13 million in operations and maintenance expense primarily related to the following • 32 million recognized in 2010 related to a liability associated with our commitment to reduce particulate emissions at our potomac river generating facility as part of the agreement with the city of alexandria virginia see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements • a decrease of 21 million resulting from a change in the allocation methodology for overhead costs and a larger number of generating facilities to which the allocated costs are distributed both as a result of the merger • a decrease of 20 million as a result of outages and some labor costs • a decrease of 17 million as a result of the repeal of the montgomery county co 2 levy including 8 million related to a refund received in 2011 of co 2 levies paid in 2010 and • a decrease of 6 million resulting from changes in asset retirement obligation assumptions partially offset by • a 49 million accrual for remediation costs at our maryland ash facilities which includes a tentative 19 million civil penalty • 15 million recognized in 2011 for major litigation costs net of recoveries • an increase of 13 million related to the addition of the rri energy generating facilities as a result of the merger and • a 10 million accrual for the brandywine storm damage and remediation partially offset by • an increase of 4 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily as a result of the addition of the longlived assets acquired in the merger and accelerated depreciation recognized 62 

in connection with the abandonment of a pipeline partially offset by decreases as a result of reductions in the carrying values of the dickerson and potomac river generating facilities as a result of impairment losses in 2010 

western pjmmiso 

our western pjmmiso segment was established as a result of the merger and includes 23 generating facilities all rri energy generating facilities with total net generating capacity of 7483 mw at december 31 2011 and 2010 

the following table summarizes the results of operations of our western pjmmiso segment 



1 represents the results of operations of our western pjmmiso segment from december 3 2010 through december 31 2010 

california 

our california segment consists of seven generating facilities with total net generating capacity of 5391 mw excluding the potrero facility of 362 mw which was shut down on february 28 2011 at december 31 2011 and eight generating facilities with total net generating capacity of 5753 mw at december 31 2010 our california segment also includes business development and construction activities for new generation in california including genon marsh landing 

the following table summarizes the results of operations of our california segment 



gross margin 

our natural gasfired units in service at contra costa and pittsburg operate under tolling agreements with pge for the majority of the capacity from these units our potrero units were subject to rmr arrangements through february 28 2011 the date of the shutdown in addition we have some units in southern california that we operate under tolling agreements with other customers our gross margin generally is not affected by changes in power generation volumes from facilities under such arrangements 

for those units that are not under tolling agreements gross margin is affected by changes in power generation volumes as well as resource adequacy capacity sales 

the increase of 94 million in realized gross margin was principally a result of the following 

• an increase of 79 million in contracted and capacity primarily as a result of the addition of the rri energy generating facilities as a result of the merger partially offset by the shutdown of the potrero generating facility and • an increase of 10 million in energy primarily as a result of the addition of the rri energy generating facilities as a result of the merger operating expenses 

the increase of 91 million in operating expenses was principally a result of the following 

• an increase of 69 million in operations and maintenance expense resulting from 83 million related to the addition of the rri energy generating facilities as a result of the merger partially offset by a decrease of 8 million resulting from the shutdown of the potrero generating facility 64 

• an increase of 13 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily as a result of the addition of the longlived assets acquired in the merger partially offset by a decrease as a result of the shutdown of the potrero generating facility and • an increase of 14 million in impairment losses for the writeoff of excess so 2 emissions allowances during 2011 as a result of the csapr partially offset by • an increase of 5 million in gain on sales of assets as a result of the sale of equipment from our potrero generating facility energy marketing 

our energy marketing segment consists of proprietary trading fuel oil management and natural gas transportation and storage activities 

the following table summarizes the results of operations of our energy marketing segment 



gross margin 

the increase of 24 million in realized gross margin was primarily as a result of an increase in fuel oil management activities natural gas transportation activities and proprietary trading 

our unrealized gross margin for both periods reflects the following 

• unrealized gains of 28 million in 2011 which included a 19 million net increase in the value of contracts for future periods and 9 million associated with the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses from power and fuel contracts that settled during the period and • unrealized losses of 8 million in 2010 which included 50 million associated with the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from power and fuel contracts that settled during the period substantially offset by a 42 million net increase in the value of contracts for future periods other operations 

our other operations segment consisted of nine generating facilities with total net generating capacity of 5068 mw at december 31 2011 and 2010 we sold our indian river generating facility 586 mw which was included in the other operations segment in january 2012 for 12 million 

other operations also includes unallocated overhead expenses and other activity that cannot be specifically identified with another segment 

the following table summarizes the results of operations of our other operations segment 



gross margin 

the decrease of 10 million in realized gross margin was principally a result of the following 

• a decrease of 15 million in realized value of hedges primarily as a result of a decline in the value realized from our power and oil hedges partially offset by • an increase of 5 million in contracted and capacity primarily as a result of the addition of the rri energy generating facilities as a result of the merger partially offset by decreases attributable to our facilities located in the northeast resulting from lower capacity prices our unrealized gross margin for both periods reflects the following 

• unrealized losses of 7 million in 2011 which included 4 million associated with the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from power and fuel contracts that settled during the period and 3 million net decrease in the value of hedge contracts for future periods and • unrealized losses of 19 million in 2010 as a result of the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from power and fuel contracts that settled during the period operating expenses

we reported a net loss of 233 million and net income of 493 million for 2010 and 2009 respectively the change in net incomeloss is detailed as follows 



realized gross margin for 2010 our realized gross margin decrease of 203 million was principally a result of the following 

• a decrease of 336 million in realized value of hedges in 2010 and 2009 realized value of hedges was 293 million and 629 million respectively which reflects the amount by which the settlement value of power contracts exceeded market prices for power offset in part by the amount by which contract prices for fuel exceeded market prices for fuel partially offset by • an increase of 113 million in energy primarily as a result of an increase in energy in eastern pjm because of an increase in the average settlement price for power a decrease in the cost of emissions allowances higher generation volumes and the addition of the western pjmmiso segment in 2010 offset in part by a decrease in realized gross margin from proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities in energy marketing and an increase in the average price of fuel and • an increase of 20 million in contracted and capacity primarily as a result of the addition of the western pjmmiso segment in 2010 as a result of the merger an increase in ancillary services revenue and additional megawatts of capacity sold in eastern pjm offset in part by a decrease in capacity prices in eastern pjm unrealized gross margin our unrealized gross margin for both periods reflects the following 

• unrealized losses of 42 million in 2010 which included 389 million associated with the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from power and fuel contracts that settled during the period substantially offset by a 347 million net increase in the value of hedge and proprietary trading contracts for future periods the increase in value was primarily related to decreases in forward power and natural gas prices offset in part by the recognition of many of our coal agreements at fair value beginning in the second quarter of 2010 and • unrealized gains of 47 million in 2009 which included a 686 million net increase in the value of hedge and trading contracts for future periods primarily related to decreases in forward power and natural gas prices substantially offset by 639 million associated with the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from power and fuel contracts that settled during the period operating expenses our operating expenses increase of 673 million was primarily a result of the following

segments 

the following discussion of our performance is organized by reportable segment which is consistent with the way we manage our business in conjunction with the merger we began reporting in five segments in the fourth quarter of 2010 eastern pjm western pjmmiso california energy marketing and other operations prior to the merger we had four reportable segments midatlantic northeast california and other operations amounts for 2010 prior to the merger and for 2009 were reclassified to conform to the current segment presentation 

gross margin overview 

the following tables detail realized and unrealized gross margin by operating segments 



  



1 gross margin excludes depreciation and amortization 

energy represents gross margin from the generation of electricity fuel sales and purchases at market prices fuel handling steam sales our proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities and natural gas transportation and storage activities 

contracted and capacity represents gross margin received from capacity sold in iso and rto administered capacity markets through rmr contracts through ppas and tolling agreements and from ancillary services 

realized value of hedges represents the actual margin upon the settlement of our power and fuel hedging contracts and the difference between market prices and contract costs for fuel power hedging contracts include sales of both power and natural gas used to hedge power prices as well as hedges to capture the incremental value related to the geographic location of our physical assets 

unrealized gross margin represents the net unrealized gain or loss on our derivative contracts including the reversal of unrealized gains and losses recognized in prior periods and changes in value for future periods 

operating statistics 

the following table summarizes power generation volumes by segment 



1 negative amounts denote net energy used by the generating facility 

the total increase in power generation volumes for 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily the result of the following 

eastern pjm an increase in our generation volumes primarily as a result of higher power prices resulting from an increase in demand because of higher average temperatures and a decrease in outages in 2010 compared to 2009 

western pjmmiso the western pjmmiso segment was formed as a result of the merger 

california the decrease in our intermediate generation volumes is primarily the result of the transbay cable becoming operational during the fourth quarter of 2010 which reduced the demand for our natural gasfired potrero generating unit 

other operations a decrease in our other operations intermediate generation as a result of transmission upgrades in 2009 which reduced the demand for the oilfired intermediate units at our canal generating facility and unplanned outages in 2010 partially offset by increases in generation volumes by our baseload and peaking units 

eastern pjm 

our eastern pjm segment includes eight generating facilities with total net generating capacity of 6341 mw at december 31 2010 and four generating facilities with total net generating capacity of 5209 mw at december 31 2009 

the following table summarizes the results of operations of our eastern pjm segment 



gross margin 

the decrease of 102 million in realized gross margin was principally a result of the following 

• a decrease of 306 million in realized value of hedges in 2010 and 2009 realized value of hedges was 280 million and 586 million respectively which reflects the amount by which the settlement value of power contracts exceeded market prices for power partially offset by the amount by which contract prices for coal exceeded market prices for coal and • a decrease of 10 million in contracted and capacity primarily related to lower average capacity prices offset in part by an increase in ancillary services revenue and additional megawatts of capacity sold in 2010 partially offset by • an increase of 214 million in energy primarily as a result of an increase in the average settlement price for power a decrease in the cost of emissions allowances and higher generation volumes offset in part by an increase in the average price of fuel our unrealized gross margin for both periods reflects the following 

• unrealized gains of 7 million in 2010 which included a 326 million net increase in the value of hedge contracts for future periods primarily related to decreases in forward power and natural gas prices offset in part by the recognition of many of our coal agreements at fair value beginning in the second quarter of 2010 the increase in value was substantially offset by 319 million associated with the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from power and fuel contracts that settled during the period and 73 

• unrealized gains of 144 million in 2009 which included a 633 million net increase in the value of hedge contracts for future periods primarily related to decreases in forward power and natural gas prices partially offset by 489 million associated with the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from power and fuel contracts that settled during the period operating expenses 

the increase of 884 million was primarily a result of the following 

• an increase of 768 million in impairment losses in 2010 we recognized 12 billion in impairment losses including 616 million related to the writeoff of goodwill recorded at our genon midatlantic registrant on its standalone balance sheet and 537 million related to our dickerson and potomac river generating facilities in 2009 we recognized 385 million in impairment losses including 202 million related to our potomac river generating facility and 183 million related to goodwill recorded at our genon midatlantic registrant on its standalone balance sheet the goodwill impairment loss and related goodwill balance are eliminated upon consolidation at genon north america see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements • an increase of 44 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily as a result of the scrubbers at our maryland generating facilities that were placed in service in december 2009 offset in part by a decrease in the carrying value of the potomac river generating facility as a result of the impairment charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2009 • an increase of 32 million related to the recognition of a liability associated with our commitment to reduce particulate emissions at our potomac river generating facility as part of the agreement with the city of alexandria virginia see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements • an increase of 29 million in operations and maintenance expense primarily as a result of an increase in costs related to the operation of the scrubbers at our maryland generating facilities and the montgomery county maryland co 2 levy imposed on our dickerson generating facility beginning in may 2010 offset in part by a decrease in planned maintenance costs in 2010 compared to 2009 and • a decrease of 11 million in gain on sales of assets primarily related to emissions allowances sold to third parties in 2009 western pjmmiso 

our western pjmmiso segment was established as a result of the merger and includes 23 generating facilities all rri energy generating facilities with total net generating capacity of 7483 mw at december 31 2010 

the following table summarizes the results of operations of our western pjmmiso segment from december 3 2010 through december 31 2010 



california 

our california segment consists of eight generating facilities with total net generating capacity of 5753 mw at december 31 2010 and three generating facilities with total net generating capacity of 2347 mw at december 31 2009 our california segment also includes business development efforts for new generation in california including genon marsh landing 

the following table summarizes the results of operations of our california segment 



gross margin 

our natural gasfired units in service at contra costa and pittsburg operate under tolling agreements with pge for 100 of the capacity from these units and our potrero units were subject to rmr arrangements in 2010 and 2009 in addition we have some units in southern california that we operate under tolling agreements with other customers therefore our gross margin generally is not affected by changes in power generation volumes from these facilities 

for those units that are not under tolling or rmr agreements gross margin is affected by changes in power generation volumes as well as resource adequacy capacity sales 

operating expenses 

the decrease of 6 million in operating expenses was principally a result of the following 

• a decrease of 14 million of impairment losses related to our potrero and contra costa generating facilities during 2009 see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements partially offset by • an increase of 9 million in depreciation expense as a result of a decrease in the useful life of our potrero generating facility because of the settlement with the city and county of san francisco executed in the third quarter of 2009 see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements energy marketing 

our energy marketing segment consists of proprietary trading fuel oil management and natural gas transportation and storage activities 

the following table summarizes the results of operations of our energy marketing segment 



gross margin 

the decrease of 133 million in realized gross margin was principally a result of a 76 million decrease from proprietary trading activities and a 57 million decrease from our fuel oil management activities the decrease in the contribution from proprietary trading was primarily a result of a decrease in the realized value associated with power positions in 2010 as compared to 2009 the decrease in the 

contribution from fuel oil management was a result of lower gross margin on positions used to hedge economically the fair value of our physical fuel oil inventory 

our unrealized gross margin for both periods reflects the following 

• unrealized losses of 8 million in 2010 which included 50 million associated with the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from power and fuel contracts that settled during the period substantially offset by a 42 million net increase in the value of contracts for future periods and • unrealized losses of 113 million in 2009 which included 101 million associated with the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from power and fuel contracts that settled during the period and a 12 million net decrease in the value of contracts for future periods other operations

the following table summarizes the results of operations of our other operations segment 



gross margin 

the decrease of 40 million in realized gross margin was principally a result of the following 

• a decrease of 30 million in realized value of hedges in 2010 and 2009 realized value of hedges was 13 million and 43 million respectively which reflects the amount by which the settlement value of power contracts exceeded market prices for power partially offset by the amount by which contract prices for fuel exceeded market prices for fuel • a decrease of 6 million in contracted and capacity primarily related to decreases in capacity prices and megawatts of capacity sold and 77 

• a decrease of 4 million in energy primarily as a result of a decrease in generation volumes from our oilfired intermediate units at our canal generating facility as a result of transmission upgrades in 2009 a decrease in the average settlement price for power and unplanned outages in 2010 offset in part by an increase in generation volumes at our bowline generating facility our unrealized gross margin for both periods reflects the following 

• unrealized losses of 19 million in 2010 as a result of the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from power and fuel contracts that settled during the period and • unrealized gains of 16 million in 2009 which included a 65 million net increase in the value of hedge contracts for future periods primarily related to decreases in forward power and fuel prices partially offset by 49 million associated with the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from power and fuel contracts that settled during the period operating expenses

• a decrease of 3 million in gain on sales of assets primarily related to emissions allowances sold to third parties in 2009 financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

management thinks that our liquidity position and cash flows from operations will be adequate to fund operating maintenance and capital expenditures to fund debt service and to meet other liquidity requirements management regularly monitors our ability to fund our operating financing and investing activities see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our debt at december 31 2011 we were in compliance with our debt covenants 

sources of funds and capital structure 

maintaining sufficient liquidity in our business is crucial in order to mitigate the risk of future financial distress to us accordingly we plan on a prospective basis for the expected liquidity requirements of our business considering the factors listed below 

• expected expenditures with respect to maintenance activities and capital improvements and related outages • expected collateral postings in support of our business • effects of market price volatility on the amount of collateral postings for hedge transactions and risk management transactions • effects of market price volatility on fuel prepayment requirements • seasonal and intramonth working capital requirements • the development and construction of new generating facilities including genon marsh landing • debt service obligations and • costs associated with litigation regulatory and tax proceedings the principal sources of our liquidity are expected to be a existing cash on hand and expected cash flows from the operations of our subsidiaries b letters of credit issued or borrowings made under the genon senior secured revolving credit facility and c letters of credit issued or borrowings made under the genon marsh landing project financing 

our operating cash flows may be affected by among other things a demand for electricity b the difference between the cost of fuel used to generate electricity and the market value of the electricity generated c commodity prices including prices for electricity emissions allowances natural gas coal and oil d operations and maintenance expenses in the ordinary course e planned and unplanned outages f terms with trade creditors and g cash requirements for capital expenditures relating to certain facilities including those necessary to comply with environmental regulations 

the table below sets forth total cash cash equivalents and availability under credit facilities of genon and its subsidiaries at december 31 2011 in millions 



1 at december 31 2011 rema did not satisfy the restricted payments test and therefore could not use such funds to distribute cash and make other restricted payments 2 availability under the genon credit facilities does not include availability under the genon marsh landing credit facility 

we consider all shortterm investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents at december 31 2011 except for amounts held in bank accounts to cover current payables all of our cash and cash equivalents were invested in aaarated united states treasury money market funds 

we and certain of our subsidiaries including genon americas generation are holding companies the chart below is a summary representation of our capital structure and is not a complete corporate organizational chart 

1 the genon credit facilities are guaranteed by certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of genon excluding genon americas generation provided however that certain of genon americas generations subsidiaries other than genon midatlantic and genon energy management and their subsidiaries guarantee the genon credit facilities to the extent permitted under the 81 

indenture for the senior notes of genon americas generation genon americas is a coborrower under the genon credit facilities and the term loan balance is recorded at genon americas 

2 at december 31 2011 the present values of lease payments under the genon midatlantic and rema operating leases were approximately 881 million and 466 million respectively assuming a 10 and 94 discount rate respectively and the termination values of the genon midatlantic and rema operating leases were 13 billion and 735 million respectively 3 at december 31 2011 33 million and 74 million were outstanding under the genon marsh landing senior secured term loan due 2017 and senior secured term loan due 2023 respectively see genon marsh landing credit facility below for discussion except for existing cash on hand genon and genon americas generation are holding companies that are dependent on the distributions and dividends of their subsidiaries for liquidity a substantial portion of cash from our operations is generated by genon midatlantic 

the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make distributions is restricted under the terms of their debt or other agreements including the operating leases of genon midatlantic and rema under their respective operating leases genon midatlantic and rema are not permitted to make any distributions and other restricted payments unless a they satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters b they are projected to satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for each of the two following periods of four fiscal quarters commencing with the fiscal quarter in which such payment is proposed to be made and c no significant lease default or event of default has occurred and is continuing in the event of a default under the respective operating leases or if the respective restricted payment tests are not satisfied genon midatlantic and rema would not be able to distribute cash at december 31 2011 genon midatlantic satisfied the restricted payments tests at december 31 2011 rema did not satisfy the restricted payments test as a result of certain lien restrictions in its lease documentation genon midatlantic has reserved 1656 million of cash which is included in funds on deposit on the consolidated balance sheet in respect of such liens see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements 

pursuant to the terms of their respective lease and debt documents genon midatlantic rema and genon marsh landing are restricted from among other actions a encumbering assets b entering into business combinations or divesting assets c incurring additional debt d entering into transactions with affiliates on other than an arms length basis or e materially changing their business therefore at december 31 2011 and 2010 all of genon midatlantics remas and genon marsh landings net assets excluding cash were deemed restricted for purposes of rule 408e3ii of regulation sx the amounts of the deemed restricted net assets were as follows 



the ability of genon americas generation to pay its obligations is dependent on the receipt of dividends from genon north america and in turn genon midatlantic capital contributions or intercompany loans from genon and its ability to refinance all or a portion of those obligations as they become due 

genon marsh landing credit facility 

in october 2010 genon marsh landing entered into a credit agreement for up to approximately 650 million of commitments to provide construction and permanent financing for the marsh landing generating facility the credit facility consists of a 155 million tranche a senior secured term loan facility due 2017 a 345 million tranche b senior secured term loan facility due 2023 a 50 million senior secured letter of credit facility to support genon marsh landings debt service reserve requirements and a 100 million senior secured letter of credit facility to support genon marsh landings collateral requirements under its ppa with pge during the second quarter of 2011 we satisfied the required initial equity contributions of 147 million and genon marsh landing began borrowing under its credit facility at december 31 2011 genon marsh landing had 33 million and 74 million outstanding under tranche a of its senior secured term loan due 2017 and tranche b of its senior secured tem loan due 2023 respectively prior to the commercial operation date of the project the collateral requirements under the ppa and construction contracts are being met by a 165 million cash collateralized letter of credit facility entered into by genon energy holdings on behalf of genon marsh landing in september 2010 at or near the commercial operation date of the project the genon energy holdings cash collateralized letter of credit facility will terminate 

the term loans are to be fully amortized by their maturity dates the tranche a term loan matures on december 31 2017 and the tranche b term loan matures on the date that is the earlier of the last day of the first fiscal quarter following the tenth anniversary of the conversion of the credit facility from a construction facility to a permanent facility upon commercial operation of the marsh landing project and december 31 2023 the expiry date of the letters of credit is december 31 2017 interest on the tranche a term loan is based on a base rate or a libor rate plus an initial applicable margin of 15 for base rate loans and 25 for libor loans with such margin increasing 025 every three years interest on the tranche b term loan is based on a base rate or a libor rate plus an initial applicable margin of 175 for base rate loans and 275 for libor loans with such margin increasing 025 every three years fees on lenders exposure under the letters of credit accrue at a rate equal to the applicable margin payable on the tranche a term loan that is based on the libor rate an undrawn commitment fee applies at a rate of 075 per annum 

in connection with the credit agreement genon marsh landing entered into interest rate swaps to mitigate the interest rate risks with respect to its term loans genon energy holdings provided limited guarantees in respect of the interest rate swaps the effective interest rate that genon marsh landing will pay for the term loans from the commercial operations date is 591 plus the stepup in margin over time the interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges with changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income with the exception of any ineffectiveness which is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations genon expects the interest rate swaps to remain highly effective in mitigating the interest rate risk 

uses of funds 

our requirements for liquidity and capital resources other than for the daytoday operation of our generating facilities are significantly influenced by the following items a capital expenditures including capital expenditures to meet environmental regulations b debt service c payments under the genon midatlantic and rema operating leases d collateral required for our asset management hedging and proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities and e the development and construction of new generating facilities in particular the genon marsh landing generating facility 

capital expenditures our capital expenditures excluding capitalized interest during 2011 were 436 million our estimated capital expenditures excluding capitalized interest not related to the marsh landing generating facility for 2012 and 2013 are 637 million and 327 million respectively see 

above under capital expenditures and capital resources for further discussion of our capital expenditures

the accounting policies described below are considered critical to obtaining an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application requires significant estimates and judgments by management in preparing our consolidated financial statements managements estimates and judgments are inherently uncertain and may differ significantly from actual results achieved management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if the following conditions apply 

• the estimate requires significant assumptions and • changes in the estimate could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition or • if different estimates that could have been selected had been used there could be a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition we have discussed the selection and application of these accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and our independent registered public accounting firm it is managements view that the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate however actual results can differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions the sections below contain information about our most critical accounting estimates as well as the effects of hypothetical changes in the material assumptions used to develop the estimates 

revenue recognition and accounting for energy trading and marketing activities 

nature of estimates required accounting standards require an accrual model to be used to account for our revenues from the sale of energy capacity and ancillary services we recognize revenue when it has been earned and collection is probable as a result of electricity delivered or capacity available to customers pursuant to contractual commitments that specify volume price and delivery requirements sales of energy primarily are based on economic dispatch or they may be asordered by an iso or rto based on member participation agreements but without an underlying contractual commitment iso and rto revenues and revenues for sales of energy based on economic dispatch are recorded on the basis of mwh delivered at the relevant dayahead or realtime prices the accrual model is also used to account for our revenues from the sales of natural gas these sales are sold at marketbased prices through third party contracts sales that have been delivered but not billed by period end are estimated 

accounting standards require a fair value model to be used to measure fair value on a recurring basis for derivative energy contracts that are used to manage our exposure to commodity price risk or that are used in our proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities we use a variety of derivative financial instruments such as futures forwards swaps and option contracts in the 

management of our business such derivative financial instruments have varying terms and durations or tenors which range from a few days to a number of years depending on the instrument 

derivative financial instruments are recorded in our consolidated financial statements at fair value as either derivative contract assets or derivative contract liabilities with changes in fair value recognized currently in income unless we have elected to apply cash flow hedging or they qualify for a scope exception pursuant to the accounting guidance management considers fair value techniques and valuation adjustments related to credit and liquidity to be critical accounting estimates these estimates are considered significant because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period and are dependent on many subjective factors transactions that are not accounted for using the fair value model under the accounting guidance for derivative financial instruments are either not derivatives or qualify for the scope exception and are accounted for under accrual accounting we recognize immediately in income appropriate inception gains and losses for transactions at other than the bid price or ask price 

key assumptions and approach used in determining fair value we generally use a market approach and incorporate assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumptions about risk andor the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation techniques the fair value measurement inputs we use vary from readily observable prices for exchangetraded and overthecounter instruments level 1 or level 2 to price curves that cannot be validated through external pricing sources level 3 note 4 to our consolidated financial statements explains the fair value hierarchy for most delivery locations and tenors where we have positions we receive multiple independent broker price quotes in accordance with the exit price objective under the fair value measurements accounting guidance the fair value of our derivative contract assets and liabilities is determined based on the net underlying position of the recorded derivative contract assets and liabilities using bid prices for our assets and ask prices for liabilities if no active market exists we estimate the fair value of certain derivative financial instruments using price extrapolation interpolation and other quantitative methods we have not identified any distressed market conditions that would alter our valuation techniques at december 31 2011 fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment our techniques for fair value estimation include assumptions for market prices correlation and volatility the degree of estimation increases for longer duration contracts contracts with multiple pricing features option contracts and offhub delivery points our assets and liabilities classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy represent approximately 4 of our total assets and 11 of our total liabilities measured at fair value at december 31 2011 

the fair value of derivative contract assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets is also affected by our assumptions as to time value credit risk and nonperformance risk the nominal value of the contracts is discounted using a forward interest rate curve based on libor in addition the fair value of our derivative contract assets is reduced to reflect the estimated default risk of counterparties on their contractual obligations to us the default risk of our counterparties for a significant portion of our overall net position is measured based on published spreads on credit default swaps the fair value of our derivative contract liabilities is reduced to reflect our estimated risk of default on our contractual obligations to counterparties and is measured based on published default rates of our debt the credit risk reflected in the fair value of our derivative contract assets and the nonperformance risk reflected in the fair value of our derivative contract liabilities are calculated with consideration of our master netting agreements with counterparties and our exposure is reduced by cash collateral posted to us against these obligations 

effect if different assumptions used the amounts recorded as revenue or cost of fuel electricity and other products change as estimates are revised to reflect actual results and changes in market conditions or other factors many of which are beyond our control because we use derivative financial instruments and have not elected cash flow or fair value hedge accounting for the majority of our derivative financial instruments certain components of our financial statements including gross margin 

operating income and balance sheet ratios are at times volatile and subject to fluctuations in value primarily as a result of changes in forward energy and fuel prices significant negative changes in fair value could require us to post additional collateral either in the form of cash or letters of credit because the fair value measurements of our material assets and liabilities are based on observable market information there is not a significant range of values around the fair value estimate for our derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value using quantitative pricing models a significant change in estimate could affect our results of operations and cash flows at the time contracts are ultimately settled the estimated fair value of our derivative contract assets and liabilities was a net asset of 881 million at december 31 2011 a 10 change in electricity and fuel prices would result in approximately a 196 million change in the fair value of our net asset at december 31 2011 see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further sensitivities in our assumptions used to calculate fair value see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on derivative financial instruments related to energy trading and marketing activities 

income taxes and deferred tax asset valuation allowance 

nature of estimates required we currently record a tax provision for state and federal income taxes including any alternative minimum tax as applicable we also recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the balance sheet carrying amounts and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recoverable based on expected future taxable income to the extent that we determine it is morelikelythannot greater than a 50 probability that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

key assumptions and approach used income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

at december 31 2011 our deferred tax assets reduced by the valuation allowance are completely offset by our deferred tax liabilities objective positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for all or a portion of deferred tax assets when significant negative evidence exists we evaluate this position and make our judgment based on the facts and circumstances at that time we think that the realization of future taxable income sufficient to utilize existing deferred tax assets is less than morelikelythannot at this time the primary factors related to this conclusion are as follows 

• the prices for power and natural gas are low compared to several years ago and have resulted in a decrease in the forecasted gross margin for our generating facilities • weak market conditions have resulted in a decrease in the forecasted gross margin of our generating facilities under the accounting guidance for the uncertainty of income taxes we must reflect in our income tax provision the full benefit of all positions that will be taken in our income tax returns except to the extent that such positions are uncertain and fall below the recognition requirements of the guidance in the event that we determine that a tax position meets the uncertainty criteria an additional liability or an adjustment to our nols determined under the measurement criteria of the guidance will result this liability or adjustment is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit we periodically reassess the tax positions reflected in our tax returns for open years based on the latest information available and 

determine whether any portion of the tax benefits reflected therein should be treated as unrecognized the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit requires management to make significant assumptions about the expected outcomes of certain tax positions included in our filed or yet to be filed tax returns 

effect if different assumptions used at the merger each of mirant and rri energy separately determined whether or not each had experienced an ownership change as defined in irc § 382 irc § 382 provides in general that an ownership change occurs when there is a greater than 50percentage point increase in ownership of a companys stock held by new or existing stockholders who own or are deemed to own under irc § 382 5 or more of the loss companys stock over a three year testing period irc § 382 limits the amount of premerger nols that can be used during any postownership change year to offset taxable income based on information contained in a shareholders recent filing made pursuant to sec regulation 13g and subsequent inquiries made on the basis of such information it is possible rri energy may have experienced an ownership change as defined above as a result of the merger as of this date we have not completed verification of the change and we continue to seek actual knowledge with respect to certain facts pertaining to the possible ownership change should we determine that rri energy had an ownership change at the merger date its nols would be substantially limited to reflect the requirements of irc § 382 prior to the merger rri energy received guidance from the internal revenue service that specified the methodology to be used in determining whether an ownership change had occurred under circumstances when a stockholder owns interests in each of the merging companies immediately prior to the merger our initial analysis had concluded that sufficient overlapping stockholders of mirant and rri energy existed immediately prior to the merger such that the merger did not cause an ownership change for rri energy therefore rri energys premerger nols were not adjusted for any irc § 382 limitation as a result of the merger mirant experienced an ownership change as a result of the merger we have reduced the amount of the mirant nols available to offset postmerger taxable income based on the limits determined in accordance with irc § 382 

we continue to be under audit for multiple years by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions considerable judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of particular items that involve interpretations of complex tax laws a tax liability is recorded for filing positions with respect to which the outcome is uncertain and the recognition criteria under the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes has been met such liabilities are based on judgment and it can take many years to resolve a recorded liability such that the related filing position is no longer subject to question we have not recorded a liability for those proposed tax adjustments related to the current tax audits where we continue to think that our filing position meets the morelikelythannot threshold prescribed in the accounting guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes any adverse outcomes arising from these matters could result in a material change in the amount of our deferred taxes 

longlived assets 

estimated useful lives 

nature of estimates required the estimated useful lives of our longlived assets are used to compute depreciation expense determine the carrying value of asset retirement obligations and estimate expected future cash flows attributable to an asset for the purposes of impairment testing estimated useful lives are based in part on the assumption that we provide an appropriate level of capital expenditures while the assets are still in operation without these continued capital expenditures the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly 

key assumptions and approach used estimated useful lives are the mechanism by which we allocate the cost of longlived assets over the assets service period we perform depreciation studies periodically to update changes in estimated useful lives the actual useful life of an asset could be affected by changes in estimated or actual commodity prices environmental regulations various legal 

factors competitive forces and our liquidity and ability to sustain required maintenance expenditures and satisfy asset retirement obligations we use composite depreciation for groups of similar assets and establish an average useful life for each group of related assets in accordance with the accounting guidance related to evaluating longlived assets for impairment we cease depreciation on longlived assets classified as held for sale also we may revise the remaining useful life of an asset held and used subject to impairment testing see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

effect if different assumptions used the determination of estimated useful lives is dependent on subjective factors such as expected market conditions commodity prices and anticipated capital expenditures since composite depreciation rates are used the actual useful life of a particular asset may differ materially from the useful life estimated for the related group of assets a 10 increase in the weighted average useful lives of our facilities would result in a 28 million decrease in annual depreciation expense a 10 decrease in the weighted average useful lives of our facilities would result in a 34 million increase in annual depreciation expense in the event the useful lives of significant assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated depreciation expense may increase liabilities recognized for future asset retirement obligations may be insufficient and impairments in the carrying value of tangible and intangible assets may result 

asset impairments 

nature of estimates required we evaluate our longlived assets including intangible assets for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance the amount of an impairment charge is calculated as the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value which generally represents the discounted expected future cash flows attributable to the asset or in the case of an asset we expect to sell at its fair value less costs to sell 

the accounting guidance related to impairments of longlived assets requires management to recognize an impairment charge if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a longlived asset or definitelived intangible asset is less than the carrying value of that asset we evaluate our longlived assets property plant and equipment and definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist or when we commit to sell the asset these evaluations of longlived assets and definitelived intangible assets may result from significant decreases in the market price of an asset a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset as well as other economic or operational analyses if the carrying amount is not recoverable an impairment charge is recorded 

the prices for power and natural gas are low compared to several years ago the energy gross margin from our baseload coal units is negatively affected by these price levels additionally weak market conditions and various demandresponse programs have resulted in a decrease in the forecasted gross margin of our generating facilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our longlived assets for indications of impairment however given the remaining useful lives for many of our generating facilities the total undiscounted cash flows for these generating facilities are more significantly affected by the longterm view of supply and demand than by the short term fluctuations in energy prices and demand as such we typically do not consider short term decreases in either energy prices or demand to cause an impairment evaluation our current expectation is that there will be a recovery in gross margins over time as a result of declining reserve margins in the markets in which we operate such that companies constructing new generating facilities can earn a reasonable rate of return on their investment this implies that gross margins and therefore cash flows in the future will be better than they are currently because market prices will need to rise high enough to provide an incentive for new generating facilities to be built and the entire market will realize the benefit of those higher gross margins 

key assumptions and approach used the impairment evaluation is a twostep process the first of which involves comparing the undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows the fair value of the asset must be calculated on a discounted basis the fair value of an asset is the price that would be received from a sale of the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for the measurement when available in the absence of quoted prices for identical or similar assets fair value is estimated using various internal and external valuation methods these methods include discounted cash flow analyses and reviewing available information on comparable transactions the determination of fair value requires management to apply judgment in estimating future capacity and energy prices environmental and maintenance expenditures and other cash flows our estimates of the fair value of the assets include significant assumptions about the timing of future cash flows remaining useful lives and the selection of a discount rate that represents the estimated weighted average cost of capital consistent with the risk inherent in future cash flows 

our longlived asset impairment assessments typically include assumptions about the following 

• electricity fuel and capacity prices • costs related to compliance with environmental regulations • timing of announced transmission projects • timing and extent of generating capacity additions and deactivations and • future capital expenditure requirements related to the generating facilities effect if different assumptions used the estimates and assumptions used to determine whether an impairment exists are subject to a high degree of uncertainty the estimated fair value of an asset would change if different estimates and assumptions were used in our applied valuation techniques including estimated undiscounted cash flows discount rates and remaining useful lives for assets held and used if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to additional losses that could be material to our results of operations if our outlook for the wholesale energy market changes negatively or if our ongoing evaluation of our business results in decisions to deactivate or dispose of facilities we could have impairment charges related to our longlived assets furthermore increasing environmental regulatory requirements could result in facilities being removed from service or derated 

see business segments in item 1 of this form 10k for a discussion of our expectations to deactivate some coalfired generating facilities of approximately 3140 mws between 2012 and 2015 see also note 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

loss contingencies 

nature of estimates required we record loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated we consider loss contingency estimates to be critical accounting estimates because they entail significant judgment regarding probabilities and ranges of exposure and the ultimate outcome of the proceedings is unknown and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows we currently have loss contingencies related to litigation environmental matters tax matters and others 

key assumptions and approach used the determination of a loss contingency requires significant judgment as to the expected outcome of each contingency in future periods in making the determination as to potential losses and probability of loss we consider all available positive and negative evidence including the expected outcome of potential litigation we record our best estimate of a loss or the low end of our range if no estimate is better than another estimate within a range of 

estimates when the loss is considered probable and can be reasonably estimated as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to the contingency and revise our estimates in our evaluation of legal matters we hold discussions with applicable legal counsel and rely on analysis of case law and legal precedents 

effect if different assumptions used revisions in our estimates of potential liabilities could materially affect our results of operations and the ultimate resolution may be materially different from the estimates that we make 

see notes 2 7 10 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our loss contingencies 

litigation 

we are currently involved in legal proceedings we estimate the range of liability through discussions with applicable legal counsel and analysis of case law and legal precedents we record our best estimate of a loss or the low end of our range if no estimate is better than another estimate within a range of estimates when the loss is considered probable and can be reasonably estimated as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially affect our results of operations and the ultimate resolution may be materially different from the estimates that we make

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

fair value measurements 

we are exposed to market risk primarily associated with commodity prices we also consider risks associated with interest rates and credit when valuing our derivative financial instruments 

the estimated net fair value of our derivative contract assets and liabilities was a net asset of 881 million and 720 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the following tables provide a summary of the factors affecting changes composed of the sum of the quarterly changes in fair value of the derivative contract asset and liability accounts for 2011 and 2010 



1 represents the fair value as of the end of each reporting period of contracts entered into during each reporting period and the gains or losses attributable to contracts that existed as of the beginning of each reporting period and were still held at the end of each reporting period 2 contracts entered into during each reporting period are reported with other changes in fair value 3 effective january 1 2011 represents the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains and losses from the settlement of contracts during each reporting period 4 represents the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains and losses from the settlement of contracts during each reporting period 5 represents the total cash settlements of contracts during each reporting period of contracts that existed at the beginning of each reporting period 

in may 2010 we concluded that we could no longer assert that physical delivery is probable for many of our coal agreements the conclusion was based on expected generation levels changes observed in the coal markets and substantial progress in the construction of a coal blending facility at the morgantown generating facility that would allow for greater flexibility of our coal supply because we can no longer assert that physical delivery of coal from these agreements is probable we are required to apply fair value accounting for these contracts the fair value of these derivative contracts is included in the tables above 

we did not elect the fair value option for any financial instruments under the accounting guidance however we do transact using derivative financial instruments which are required to be recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets under the accounting guidance related to derivative financial instruments 

at december 31 2011 the estimated net fair value of our derivative contract assets and liabilities are asset liability 



the fair values shown in the table above are subject to significant changes as a result of fluctuating commodity forward market prices volatility and credit risk for further discussion of how we determine these fair values see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—recently adopted accounting guidance and critical accounting estimates—critical accounting estimates in item 7 of this form 10k 

commodity price risk 

in connection with our business of generating electricity we are exposed to energy commodity price risk associated with the acquisition of fuel and emissions allowances needed to generate electricity the price of electricity produced and sold and the fair value of our fuel inventories a portion of our fuel requirements is purchased in the spot market and a portion of the electricity we 

produce is sold in the spot market in addition the open positions in our proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities expose us to risks associated with changes in energy commodity prices 

the financial performance of our business of generating electricity is influenced by the difference between the variable cost of converting a fuel such as natural gas coal or oil into electricity and the variable revenue we receive from the sale of that electricity the difference between the cost of a specific fuel used to generate one mwh of electricity and the market value of the electricity generated is commonly referred to as the conversion spread absent the effects of our derivative contract activities the operating margins that we realize are equal to the difference between the aggregate conversion spread and the cost of operating the facilities that produce the electricity sold 

conversion spreads are dependent on a variety of factors that influence the cost of fuel and the sales price of the electricity generated over the longer term including conversion spreads of other generating facilities in the regions in which we operate facility outages weather and general economic conditions as a result of these influences the cost of fuel and electricity prices do not always change in the same magnitude or direction which results in conversion spreads for a particular generating facility widening or narrowing or becoming negative over any given period 

through our asset management activities we enter into a variety of exchangetraded and otc energy and energyrelated derivative financial instruments such as forward contracts futures contracts option contracts and financial swap agreements to manage our exposure to commodity price risks these contracts have varying terms and durations which range from a few days to years depending on the instrument our proprietary trading activities also utilize similar derivative contracts in markets where we have a physical presence to attempt to generate incremental gross margin our fuel oil management activities use derivative financial instruments to hedge economically the fair value of our physical fuel oil inventories optimize the approximately two million barrels of storage capacity that we own as well as attempt to profit from market opportunities related to timing andor differences in the pricing of various products 

derivative energy contracts that are required to be reflected at fair value are presented as derivative contract assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets the net changes in their fair market values are recognized in income in the period of change as a result our financial performance varies depending on changes in the prices of energy and energyrelated commodities the determination of fair value considers various factors including closing exchange or otc market price quotations time value credit quality liquidity and volatility factors underlying options see item 7 critical accounting estimates for the accounting treatment of our energy trading and marketing activities 

counterparty credit risk 

the valuation of our derivative contract assets is affected by the default risk of the counterparties with which we transact we recognized a reserve which is reflected as a reduction of our derivative contract assets related to counterparty credit risk of 48 million and 21 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting guidance we calculate the credit reserve through consideration of observable market inputs when available we calculate our credit reserve using published spreads where available or proxies based upon published spreads on credit default swaps for our counterparties applied to our current exposure and potential loss exposure from the financial commitments in our risk management portfolio we do not however transact in credit default swaps or any other credit derivative potential loss exposure is calculated as our current exposure plus a calculated var over the remaining life of the contracts 

our noncollateralized power hedges entered into by genon midatlantic with financial institutions which represent 37 of our net notional power position at december 31 2011 are senior unsecured obligations of genon midatlantic and the counterparties and do not require either party to post cash collateral for initial margin or for securing exposure as a result of changes in power or natural gas prices our coal contracts included in derivative contract assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets also do not require either party to post cash collateral for initial margin or for securing exposure as a result of changes in coal prices an increase of 10 in the spread of credit default swaps of our trading partners would result in an increase of 5 million in our credit reserve at december 31 2011 

once we have delivered a physical commodity or agreed to financial settlement terms we are subject to collection risk collection risk is similar to credit risk and collection risk is accounted for when we establish our provision for uncollectible accounts we manage this risk using the same techniques and processes used in credit risk discussed above 

we also monitor counterparty credit concentration risk on both an individual basis and a group counterparty basis see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

genon credit risk 

in valuing our derivative contract liabilities we apply a valuation adjustment for our nonperformance which is based on the probability of our default our methodology incorporates published spreads on our credit default swaps where available or proxies based upon published spreads an increase of 10 in the spread of our credit default swap rate would have a 1 million effect on our consolidated statement of operations for 2011 

broker quotes 

the fair value of our derivative contract assets and liabilities is based largely on observable quoted prices from exchanges and unadjusted indicative quoted prices from independent brokers in active markets who regularly facilitate our transactions an active market is considered to have transactions with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis we think that these prices represent the best available information for valuation purposes in determining the fair value of our derivative contract assets and liabilities we use thirdparty market pricing where available note 4 to our consolidated financial statements explains the fair value hierarchy our transactions in level 1 of the fair value hierarchy primarily consist of natural gas and crude oil futures traded on the nymex and swaps cleared against nymex prices for these transactions we use the unadjusted published settled prices on the valuation date our transactions in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy primarily include nonexchangetraded derivatives such as otc forwards swaps and options and certain energy derivative instruments that are cleared and settled through exchanges we value these transactions using indicative quoted prices from independent brokers or other widelyaccepted valuation methodologies transactions are classified in level 2 if substantially all greater than 90 of the fair value can be corroborated using observable market inputs such as transactable broker quotes in accordance with the exit price objective under the fair value measurements accounting guidance the fair value of our derivative contract assets and liabilities is determined based on the net underlying position of the recorded derivative contract assets and liabilities using bid prices for our assets and ask prices for liabilities the quotes that we obtain from brokers are nonbinding in nature but are from brokers that typically transact in the market being quoted and are based on their knowledge of market transactions on the valuation date we typically obtain multiple broker quotes on the valuation date for each delivery location that extend for the tenor of our underlying contracts the number of quotes that we can obtain depends on the relative liquidity of the delivery location on the valuation date if multiple broker quotes are received for a contract we use an average of the quoted bid or ask prices if only one broker quote is received for a delivery location and it cannot be validated through other 

external sources we will assign the quote to a lower level within the fair value hierarchy in some instances we may combine broker quotes for a liquid delivery hub with broker quotes for the price spread between the liquid delivery hub and the delivery location under the contract we also may apply interpolation techniques to value monthly strips if broker quotes are only available on a seasonal or annual basis we perform validation procedures on the broker quotes at least on a monthly basis the validation procedures include reviewing the quotes for accuracy and comparing them to our internal price curves in certain instances we may discard a broker quote if it is a clear outlier and multiple other quotes are obtained at december 31 2011 we obtained broker quotes for 100 of our delivery locations classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy 

inactive markets are considered to be those markets with few transactions noncurrent pricing or prices that vary over time or among market makers our transactions in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy may involve transactions whereby observable market data such as broker quotes are not available for substantially all of the tenor of the contract or we are only able to obtain indicative broker quotes that cannot be corroborated by observable market data in such cases we may apply valuation techniques such as extrapolation and other quantitative methods to determine fair value proprietary models may also be used to determine the fair value of certain of our derivative contract assets and liabilities that may be structured or otherwise tailored our techniques for fair value estimation include assumptions for market prices correlation and volatility the degree of estimation increases for longer duration contracts contracts with multiple pricing features option contracts and offhub delivery points at december 31 2011 our assets and liabilities classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy represented approximately 4 of our total assets and 11 of our total liabilities measured at fair value 

value at risk 

our risk management policy limits our trading to certain products and contains limits and restrictions related to our asset management proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities 

we manage the price risk associated with asset management activities through a variety of methods our risk management policy requires that asset management activities are restricted to only those activities that are riskreducing we ensure compliance with this restriction through the use of a variety of internal controls with the primary control being a test at the transactional level of each individual forward transaction executed relative to the overall asset position 

we also use var to measure the market price risk of our energy asset portfolio as a result of potential changes in market prices var is a statistical model that provides an estimate of potential loss we calculate var based on the parametric variancecovariance approach utilizing a 95 confidence interval and a oneday holding period on a rolling 24month forward looking period additionally we estimate correlation based on historical commodity price changes volatilities are based on a combination of historical price changes and implied market rates 

var is calculated quarterly on an asset management portfolio comprised of marktomarket and non marktomarket energy assets and liabilities including generating facilities and bilateral physical and financial transactions asset management var levels are substantially reduced as a result of our decision to actively hedge economically in the forward markets the commodity price risk related to the expected generation and fuel usage of our generating facilities see item 1 business—asset management for discussion of our hedging strategies 

the following table summarizes yearend average high and low var for our asset management portfolio 



we calculate var daily on portfolios consisting of marktomarket and non marktomarket bilateral physical and financial transactions related to our proprietary trading activities and fuel oil management operations 

the following table summarizes yearend average high and low var for our proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities 



because of inherent limitations of statistical measures such as var and the seasonality of changes in market prices the var calculation may not reflect the full extent of our commodity price risk exposure on our cash flows and liquidity additionally actual changes in the fair value of marktomarket energy assets and liabilities could differ from the calculated var and such changes could have a material effect on our financial results 

interest rate risk 

fair value measurement 

we are also subject to interest rate risk when discounting to account for time value in determining the fair value of our derivative contract assets and liabilities the nominal value of our derivative contract assets and liabilities is discounted using a libor forward interest rate curve based on the tenor of our transactions it is estimated that a one percentage point change in market interest rates would result in a change of 16 million to our derivative contract assets and a change of 5 million to our derivative contract liabilities at december 31 2011 

debt 

some of our debt is subject to variable interest rates including our 691 million senior secured term loan and our 788 million senior secured revolving credit facility with the senior secured term loan fully drawn it is estimated that a one percentage point change in market interest rates above 175 would result in a change in our annual interest expense of approximately 7 million if the senior secured revolving credit facility was fully drawn it is estimated that a one percentage point change in market interest rates would result in a change in our annual interest expense of approximately 8 million 

the genon marsh landing credit agreement is also subject to variable interest rates the credit facility consists of a 155 million tranche a senior secured term loan facility a 345 million tranche b 

senior secured term loan facility a 50 million senior secured letter of credit facility to support genon marsh landings debt service reserve requirements and a 100 million senior secured letter of credit facility to support genon marsh landings collateral requirements under its ppa with pge the interest rate swaps cover 100 of the expected outstanding term loans balances during the operating period and a substantial portion of the expected outstanding term loans balances during the construction period the remaining borrowings during the construction period are still subject to variability in interest rates at the projected peak borrowing levels during the construction period a one percentage point change in market interest rates would result in a change in our annual interest cost of less than 1 million 

coal agreement risk 

our coal supply comes primarily from the northern appalachian and central appalachian coal regions we enter into contracts of varying tenors to secure appropriate quantities of fuel that meet the varying specifications of our generating facilities for our coalfired generating facilities we purchase most of our coal from a small number of suppliers under contracts with terms of varying lengths some of which extend to 2014 and one that extends to 2020 excluding our keystone and conemaugh generating facilities which are not 100 owned by us and excluding our seward generating facility which burns waste coal supplied by an allrequirements contract we had exposure to three counterparties at december 31 2011 and 2010 that each represented an exposure of more than 10 of our total coal commitments by volume for the respective succeeding year and in aggregate represented approximately 62 and 76 of our total coal commitments at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively at december 31 2011 and 2010 one counterparty represented an exposure of 38 and 52 respectively of these total coal commitments by volume 

in addition we have nonperformance risk associated with our coal agreements there is risk that our coal suppliers may not provide the contractual quantities on the dates specified within the agreements or the deliveries may be carried over to future periods if our coal suppliers do not perform in accordance with the agreements we may have to procure coal in the market to meet our needs or power in the market to meet our obligations in addition generally our coal suppliers do not have investment grade credit ratings nor do they post collateral with us and accordingly we may have limited ability to collect damages in the event of default by such suppliers we seek to mitigate this risk through diversification of coal suppliers to the extent possible and through guarantees despite this there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful in mitigating credit risk from coal suppliers nonperformance or default risk by our coal suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

certain of our coal contracts are not required to be recorded at fair value under the accounting guidance for derivative financial instruments as such these contracts are not included in derivative contract assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets these contracts contain pricing terms that are favorable compared to forward market prices at december 31 2011 and are projected to provide a 1 million benefit to our realized value of hedges through 2013 as the coal is utilized in the production of electricity

 item 1   business tableend  

on december 3 2010 mirant and rri energy completed their merger mirant merged with a whollyowned subsidiary of rri energy with mirant surviving the merger as a whollyowned subsidiary of rri energy in connection with the allstock taxfree merger rri energy changed its name to genon energy inc mirant stockholders received a fixed ratio of 2835 shares of genon common stock for each share of mirant common stock and mirant changed its name to genon energy holdings 

 

while rri energy was the legal acquirer the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition and mirant was deemed to have acquired rri energy for accounting purposes as a consequence of the reverse acquisition accounting treatment the historical financial statements and results of operations presented for periods prior to the merger date are the historical statements of mirant except for stockholders’ equity which has been retroactively adjusted for the equivalent number of shares of the legal acquirer the operations of the former rri energy businesses have been included in the financial statements from the date of the merger specifically the consolidated financial statements and financial and operational results of genon include the results of mirant through december 2 2010 and include the results of the combined entities from december 3 2010 unless indicated otherwise 

 

pursuant to the plan for mirant and certain of its subsidiaries on january 3 2006 mirant emerged from bankruptcy and acquired substantially all of the assets of the old mirant corporation the plan provides that new mirant now named genon energy holdings has no successor liability for any unassumed obligations of the old mirant corporation the old corporation was then renamed and transferred to a trust which is not affiliated with genon energy holdings for further information about our corporate history revenues suppliers business segments and mirant’s bankruptcy see notes 1 14 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements and “selected financial data” in item 6 of this form 10k 

 

overview 

 

we provide energy capacity ancillary and other energy services to wholesale customers in competitive energy markets in the united states through ownership and operation of and contracting for power generation capacity we are a wholesale generator with approximately 24200 mw of net electric generating capacity in the pjm miso northeast and southeast regions and california we also operate integrated asset management and energy marketing organizations including proprietary trading operations our customers are principally isos rtos and investorowned utilities our generating portfolio is diversified across fossil fuel and technology types operating characteristics and several regional power markets and serves customers primarily located near major metropolitan load centers 

 

at december 31 2010 our generating capacity was 50 in pjm 23 in caiso 10 in the southeast 7 in miso and 10 in nyiso and isone the net generating capacity of these facilities consisted of approximately 34 baseload 46 intermediate and 20 peaking capacity our coal facilities generally dispatch as baseload although some dispatch as intermediate capacity and our gas oil and dual fuel plants primarily dispatch as intermediate andor peaking capacity 

 

strategy 

 

our goal is to create longterm stockholder value across a broad range of commodity price environments we intend to achieve this goal by 

 

successfully integrating the companies and achieving cost savings targets we expect to achieve approximately 150 million in annual cost savings through reductions in corporate overhead and support costs we expect cost savings to result from consolidations in several areas including headquarters it systems and corporate functions such as accounting human resources and finance starting in january 2012 we expect to achieve the full 150 million of annual cost savings we have estimated the total mergerrelated costs at 

approximately 215 million these costs include 87 million of advisory and legal fees and 128 million of other mergerrelated costs including costs to achieve the savings these amounts include 25 million incurred by rri energy prior to the merger during 2010 the company incurred 114 million we expect to incur approximately 63 million 10 million and 3 million during 2011 2012 and 2013 and beyond respectively see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k and note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

continued operating and commercial expertise we have substantial experience in the management operation and optimization of a portfolio of diverse generating facilities drawing on the best practices of mirant and rri energy we intend to operate our generating facilities safely and efficiently and in an environmentally responsible manner to achieve optimal availability and performance to maximize cash flow 

 

transacting to reduce variability in realized gross margin we intend to develop and execute appropriate hedging strategies to manage risks associated with the volatility in the price at which we sell power and in the prices of fuel emissions allowances and other inputs required to produce such power this includes hedging over multiple years to reduce the variability in realized gross margin from our expected generation in addition we expect to continue to sell capacity either bilaterally or through periodic auction processes 

 

investing capital prudently our capital investment decisions are focused on achieving an appropriate return for our stockholders capital investments include participating in the development or acquisition of new facilities the maintenance of our existing facilities for longterm availability and improved commercial availability and investments in our existing facilities to improve their competitive position 

 

maintaining appropriate liquidity and capital structure through disciplined balance sheet management and maintaining adequate liquidity we expect to be able to operate across a broad range of commodity price environments 

 

business segments 

 

we have five operating segments eastern pjm western pjmmiso california energy marketing and other operations 

 

the eastern pjm segment consists of eight generating facilities located in maryland new jersey and virginia the maryland and virginia generating facilities are located near washington dc 

 

the western pjmmiso segment consists of 23 generating facilities located in illinois ohio and pennsylvania 

 

the california segment consists of eight generating facilities and includes other business development efforts including the marsh landing project 

 

the energy marketing segment consists of our proprietary trading fuel oil management and natural gas transportation and storage activities 

 

the other operations segment consists of three generating facilities located in massachusetts one generating facility located in new york three generating facilities located in florida one generating facility located in mississippi and one generating facility located in texas for 2008 the other operations segment included the lovett generating facility in new york which was shut down on april 19 2008 and demolished in 2009 

the table below summarizes selected financial information of our operations by business segment for 2010 

 

 

 

 

  

eliminations for revenues and gross margin are primarily related to intercompany sales of emissions allowances eliminations for operating incomeloss also include a 616 million impairment loss related to goodwill recorded at our genon midatlantic subsidiary on its standalone balance sheet the goodwill impairment loss and related goodwill balance are eliminated upon consolidation at genon north america and are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of the company for selected financial information about our business segments see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

eastern pjm segment 

 

we own or lease eight generating facilities in the eastern pjm segment with total net generating capacity of 6336 mw our eastern pjm segment had a combined 2010 net capacity factor of 33 the following table presents the details of our eastern pjm generating facilities 

 

 

 

 

  

we completed the installation of scrubbers at our chalk point dickerson and morgantown coalfired units in the fourth quarter of 2009 we previously installed scr systems at the morgantown coalfired units and one of the chalk point coalfired units and a selective auto catalytic reduction system at the other chalk 

point coalfired unit in addition we installed selective noncatalytic reduction systems at the three dickerson coalfired units these controls are capable of reducing emissions of so 2  no x and mercury by approximately 98 90 and 80 respectively for three of our largest coalfired units in maryland 

 

we reviewed our chalk point dickerson morgantown and potomac river generating facilities for impairment as a result of our annual assessment of the goodwill recorded at our genon midatlantic registrant on its standalone balance sheet which is eliminated upon consolidation at genon north america upon completion of the assessment we determined that none of the genon midatlantic generating facilities was impaired at october 31 2010 

 

in december 2010 pjm published an updated load forecast which depicted a decrease in the expected demand from prior projections because of lower economic growth expectations as a result of the load forecast our current expectation is that there will be a decrease in the clearing prices for future capacity auctions in certain years the decrease in projected capacity revenue caused us to update our october 2010 impairment review of genon midatlantic’s longlived assets upon completion of our assessment which was based on the accounting guidance related to the impairment of longlived assets we determined that the dickerson and potomac river generating facilities were impaired at december 31 2010 as the carrying value exceeded the updated december 2010 undiscounted cash flows we recorded fourth quarter impairment losses of 523 million and 42 million on our consolidated statement of operations to reduce the carrying values of the dickerson and potomac river generating facilities respectively to their estimated fair values in addition as a result of the full impairment of the potomac river generating facility we recorded 32 million in operations and maintenance expense and corresponding liabilities associated with our commitment to reduce particulate emissions at our potomac river generating facility as part of the agreement with the city of alexandria virginia the planned capital investment would not be recovered in future periods based on the current projected cash flows of the potomac river generating facility we also have 32 million included in funds on deposit and other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets which represents the remaining balance placed in escrow as a result of the agreement with the city of alexandria see note 5c to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our genon midatlantic impairment analyses 

 

our generating facilities located in new jersey may require further investment in environmental controls see “environmental regulation” below for further information 

 

western pjmmiso segment 

 

we own or lease 23 generating facilities in the western pjmmiso segment with total net generating capacity of 7483 mw our western pjmmiso segment had a combined 2010 net capacity factor of 36 the following table presents the details of our western pjmmiso generating facilities 

 

 4 

 

 

 

  

we expect the avon lake new castle and niles generating facilities to move from the miso region to the pjm region in june 2011 as a result of the ferc’s approval of the transfer 

 

in 2009 and 2010 we installed scrubbers at the keystone and cheswick generating facilities to reduce the so 2 emissions from these facilities as a result the number of so 2 allowances we will need to purchase in the market to comply with current regulations is reduced these scrubbers are capable of removing up to 98 of the so 2 from the exhaust as well as reducing mercury emissions by up to 80 the units had previously been retrofitted with scrs to reduce no x emissions 

 

california segment 

 

we own eight generating facilities in california with total net generating capacity of 5725 mw our california segment generating facilities had a combined 2010 net capacity factor of 2 the following table presents the details of our california generating facilities 

 

 

 

  

in the third quarter of 2009 genon potrero executed a settlement agreement with the city and county of san francisco in which it agreed to shut down the potrero generating facility when it is no longer needed for reliability as determined by the caiso that settlement agreement became effective in november 2009 in december 2010 the caiso provided genon potrero with the requisite notice of termination of the rmr agreement on january 19 2011 at the request of genon potrero the ferc approved changes to genon potrero’s rmr agreement to allow the caiso to terminate the rmr agreement effective february 28 2011 on february 28 2011 the potrero facility was shut down 

 

our existing generating facilities in california depend almost entirely on payments they receive to operate in support of system and local reliability through the sale of resource adequacy capacity to load serving entities the energy capacity and ancillary services markets as currently constituted will not support the capital expenditures necessary to repower or reconstruct our facilities in order to obtain the necessary capital support for repowering or reconstructing our facilities we would need to obtain contracts with creditworthy buyers absent that our existing generating facilities in california will be commercially viable only as long as they have contracts for their capacity 

 

energy marketing segment 

 

our energy marketing segment includes our proprietary trading fuel oil management and natural gas transportation and storage activities this activity includes the purchase and sale of electricity fuel and emissions allowances sometimes through financial derivatives 

 

using our fundamental understanding of the markets in which we operate we support our commercial asset management activities as well as engage in proprietary trading when we identify opportunities we engage in fuel oil management activities to hedge economically the fair value of our physical fuel oil inventories optimize the approximately three million barrels of storage capacity that we own or lease as well as attempt to profit from market opportunities related to timing andor differences in the pricing of various products we engage in natural gas transportation and storage activities to optimize our physical natural gas and storage positions and manage the physical gas requirements for a portion of our assets 

 

proprietary trading fuel oil management and natural gas transportation and storage activities together will typically comprise less than 5 of our realized gross margin all of our commercial activities are governed by a comprehensive risk management policy which includes limits on the size of volumetric positions and var for our proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities and requires all incremental natural gas transportation and natural gas storage activities to be risk reducing for 2010 our combined average daily var for proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities was 2 million 

 

other operations segment 

 

we own or lease four generating facilities in the northeast region and five generating facilities in the southeast region with total net generating capacity of 5055 mw other operations had a combined 2010 net capacity factor of 8 other operations is comprised of our generating facilities located in massachusetts 

new york florida mississippi and texas the following table presents the details of our other operations generating facilities 

 

 

 

 

  

during the second quarter of 2010 the nyiso issued its annual peak load and energy forecast in its load and capacity data report the gold book the gold book reports projected electricity supply and demand for the new york control area for the next ten years the most recent gold book projects a significant decrease in future electricity demand as a result of current economic conditions and the expected future effects of demandside management programs in new york the expected reduction in future demand as a result of demandside management programs is being driven primarily by an energy efficiency program being instituted within the state of new york that will seek to achieve a 15 reduction from 2007 energy volumes by 2015 as a result of the projections in the gold book we evaluated the bowline generating facility for impairment in the second quarter of 2010 the sum of the probability weighted undiscounted cash flows for the bowline generating facility exceeded the carrying value as a result we did not record an impairment loss for the bowline generating facility during the second quarter of 2010 

 

genon bowline has challenged its property tax assessment for the 2009 and 2010 tax years although the assessment for the 2010 tax year was reduced significantly from the assessment received in 2009 the assessment continues to exceed significantly the estimated fair value of the generating facility 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 we identified certain operational issues that reduced the available capacity of the bowline generating facility we are in the process of evaluating longterm solutions for the generating facility but our current expectation is that the reduction in available capacity could extend through 2012 in the fourth quarter of 2010 we again evaluated the bowline generating facility for impairment because of the expected extended reduction in available capacity together with the pending property tax litigation and the effect of supply and demand assumptions in the nyiso’s gold book the sum of the probability weighted undiscounted cash flows for the bowline generating facility exceeded the carrying value as a result we did not record an impairment loss for the bowline generating facility during 2010 see note 5c to our 

consolidated financial statements for further information related to our impairment analysis of the bowline generating facility 

 

isone previously had determined that at times it was necessary for the canal generating facility to operate to meet local reliability criteria for sema when it is not economic for the canal generating facility to operate based upon prevailing market prices when the canal generating facility operates to meet local reliability criteria we are compensated at the price we bid into the isone pursuant to isone market rules rather than at the market price during 2009 nstar electric company completed planned upgrades to the sema transmission system these upgrades have reduced the need for the canal generating facility to operate and caused a reduction in energy gross margin compared to historical levels the final phase of these transmission upgrades was completed in the third quarter of 2009 and as a result the capacity factor for the canal generating facility dropped as compared to 2008 with the completion of the transmission upgrades and because of the canal generating facility’s high fuel costs relative to other generation in the northeast market we expect that the future revenues of the canal generating facility will be principally capacity revenue from the isone forward capacity market 

 

the kendall generating facility which is a cogeneration facility has longterm agreements under which it sells steam 

 

pursuant to a consent decree we discontinued operation of units 4 and 5 at our lovett generating facility in new york in may 2007 and april 2008 respectively in addition we discontinued operation of unit 3 at the lovett generating facility in may 2007 because it was uneconomic to operate the unit we completed the demolition of the lovett generating facility in 2009 

 

asset management 

 

we provide energy capacity ancillary and other energy services to wholesale customers in competitive energy markets in the united states including isos and rtos power aggregators retail providers electriccooperative utilities other power generating companies and load serving entities our commercial operations consist primarily of dispatching electricity hedging the generation and sale of electricity selling capacity procuring and managing fuel and providing logistical support for the operation of our facilities for example by procuring transportation for coal and natural gas 

 

our strategy is to enter into economic hedges—forward sales of electricity and forward purchases of fuel and emissions allowances—to manage the risks associated with volatility in prices for electricity fuel and emissions allowances and to achieve more predictable financial results in addition given the high correlation between natural gas prices and electricity prices in many of the markets in which we operate we enter into forward sales of natural gas to hedge economically our exposure to changes in the price of electricity we procure our hedges in otc transactions or on exchanges where electricity fuel and emissions allowances are broadly traded or through specific transactions with buyers and sellers using futures forwards swaps and options our hedges cover various periods including several years see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k for our aggregate hedge levels based on expected generation for 2011 to 2015 in addition see item 1a “risk factors—risks related to economic and financial market conditions—greater regulation of energy contracts” for a discussion of the risks of implementation of the doddfrank act on our ability to hedge economically our generation including potentially reducing liquidity in the energy and commodity markets and if we are required to clear such transactions on exchanges or meet other requirements by significantly increasing the collateral costs associated with such activities 

 

we sell capacity either bilaterally or through periodic auction processes in each iso and rto market in which we participate our capacity sales primarily occur through the pjm rpm and isone fcm auctions but also in caiso miso nyiso and other markets where we enter into agreements with counterparties we expect that a substantial portion of our pjm capacity will continue to be sold in pjm up to three years in advance revenue from these capacity sales is determined by market rules designed to ensure regional reliability encourage competition and reduce energy price volatility these capacity sales provide an important 

source of predictable revenues for us over the contracted periods at january 31 2011 total projected contracted capacity and ppa revenues for which prices have been set for 2011 through 2014 are 31 billion 

 

power 

 

we hedge economically a substantial portion of our eastern pjm coalfired baseload generation and certain of our other generation we generally do not hedge our intermediate and peaking units for tenors greater than 12 months a significant portion of our hedges are financial swap transactions between genon midatlantic and financial counterparties that are senior unsecured obligations of such parties and do not require either party to post cash collateral either for initial margin or for securing exposure as a result of changes in power or natural gas prices 

 

although standard industry otc transactions make up a substantial portion of our economic hedge portfolio at times we sell nonstandard structured products to customers 

 

several of our california florida and mississippi generating facilities typically operate under contracts for their capacity or energy in california genon delta has entered into agreements with pge to provide electricity from our natural gasfired units in service at contra costa and pittsburg with respect to contra costa units 6 and 7 genon delta is providing 674 mw of capacity to pge for 2011 under a multiyear tolling agreement into which we entered in 2006 genon delta entered into a new agreement with pge on september 2 2009 for the 674 mw at contra costa units 6 and 7 for the period from november 2011 through april 2013 at the end of the agreement and subject to any necessary regulatory approval genon delta has agreed to retire contra costa units 6 and 7 which began operations in 1964 in furtherance of state and federal policies to retire aging power plants that utilize oncethrough cooling technology in addition genon delta entered into an agreement with pge on october 28 2010 for 1159 mw of capacity from pittsburg units 5 6 and 7 for three years commencing january 1 2011 with options for pge to extend the agreement for each of 2014 and 2015 under the respective agreements genon delta will receive monthly capacity payments with bonuses andor penalties based on heat rate and availability on september 2 2009 genon marsh landing entered into a tenyear ppa with pge for 760 mw of natural gasfired peaking generation to be constructed adjacent to our contra costa generating facility near antioch california construction of the marsh landing generating facility is expected to be completed by mid2013 

 

fuel 

 

we enter into contracts of varying terms to secure appropriate quantities of fuel that meet the varying specifications of our generating facilities for our coalfired generating facilities we purchase most of our coal from a small number of suppliers under contracts with terms of varying lengths some of which extend to 2013 and one that extends to 2020 see “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in item 7a of this form 10k for discussion of our coal agreement risk for our oilfired units we typically purchase fuel from a small number of suppliers either in the spot market or under contracts with terms of varying lengths for our natural gasfired facilities in addition to purchasing natural gas we arrange for and schedule its transportation through pipelines to perform a portion of these functions we lease natural gas transportation and storage capacity we sell excess fuel supplies to third parties 

 

we receive coal at our generating facilities primarily by rail and truck in addition we can receive coal by barge at three of our plants our morgantown generating facility completed construction of a barge unloader in 2008 that enables us to receive coal from domestic and international sources and our cheswick and elrama generating facilities also have barge unloading facilities which are typically used to receive domestic coal we have coal blending facilities at our cheswick morgantown and titus generating facilities that allow for greater flexibility of coal supply by allowing various coal qualities to be blended while also meeting emissions targets we monitor coal supply and delivery logistics carefully and despite occasional interruptions of planned deliveries to date we have managed to avoid any significant detrimental effects on our operations because of the risk of disruptions in our coal supply we strive to maintain adequate targeted levels of coal inventories at our coalfired facilities interruptions to planned or contracted deliveries can result from a variety of factors 

including operational issues of coal suppliers lack of or constraints in coal transportation including rail system and river system disruptions and adverse weather conditions 

 

emissions 

 

our commercial operations manage the acquisition and use of emissions allowances for our generating facilities our generating facilities in maryland massachusetts new jersey and new york are subject to the rggi a multistate capandtrade program to reduce co 2 emissions from units of 25 mw or greater the rggi became effective on january 1 2009 to comply we are required to purchase allowances either through periodic auctions or open market transactions to offset our co 2 emissions in 2010 and 2009 we recognized approximately 34 million and 45 million respectively in cost of fuel electricity and other products as a result of our compliance with the rggi 

 

in may 2010 the montgomery county council imposed a levy on major emitters of co 2 in montgomery county maryland which we estimate will impose on the dickerson generating facility of genon midatlantic an additional 10 million to 15 million per year in levies owed to montgomery county during 2010 we recognized 8 million in levies in operations and maintenance expense see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the action filed against montgomery county in the united states district court for the district of maryland by genon midatlantic 

 

coal combustion byproducts 

 

existing state and federal rules require the proper management and disposal of wastes and other materials we produce byproducts from our coalfired generating units including ash and gypsum we actively manage the current and planned disposition of each of these byproducts all of our ash disposal facilities are dry landfills although we do use ponds to dewater ash at some facilities our disposal plan for ash includes land filling at our existing ash management facilities purchasing and permitting additional disposal sites using third parties to handle and dispose of the ash and constructing an ash beneficiation facility at our morgantown site to make the ash more suitable for sale to third parties for the production of concrete as well as other beneficial uses we commenced construction of the ash beneficiation facility in february 2011 and expect to complete it in 2012 our disposal plan for gypsum includes disposing of it in approved landfills and selling it to third parties for use in the production of drywall currently we expect to spend approximately 130 million over the next five years for ash landfill expansions closures and for building an ash beneficiation facility 

 

there is increased focus on the regulation of coal combustion products and if the manner in which they are regulated changes we may be required to change our management practices for these byproducts andor incur additional costs 

 

competitive environment 

 

the power generating industry is capital intensive and highly competitive our competitors include regulated utilities merchant energy companies financial institutions and other companies for a discussion of competitive factors see item 1a “risk factors” coalfired natural gasfired nuclear and hydroelectric generation currently account for approximately 45 24 20 and 6 respectively of the electricity produced in the united states other energy sources account for the remaining 5 of electricity produced 

 

wholesale power generation is highly fragmented compared to other commodity industries there is wide variation in terms of the capabilities resources nature and identity of the companies with which we compete our competitive advantages include the following 

 

 10 

 

  

given the substantial time required to permit and construct new power plants the process to add generating capacity must begin years in advance of anticipated growth in demand a number of isos and rtos including those in markets in which we operate have implemented capacity markets as a way to encourage construction of additional generation when market conditions warrant over the last several years very little new generation has been constructed as a result of the economic downturn in recent years and programs to reduce the demand for electricity which have resulted in a decrease in the rate at which the longterm demand for electricity is forecasted to grow also the costs to construct new generating facilities have been rising and there is substantial environmental opposition to building either coalfired or nuclear plants 

 

in some markets state regulators have proposed initiatives to provide longterm contracts for new generating capacity in december 2010 the maryland public service commission sought comments on a possible request for proposals for new generating facilities the draft request for proposals would require any such new generation to bid into the capacity markets in a manner that would ensure clearing in the market the draft request provides for project submittals on july 29 2011 we filed comments on the draft request for proposals on january 28 2011 noting there is no need for additional capacity at this time if the request for proposals is issued as currently drafted it could have a negative effect on capacity prices in pjm in future years 

 

on january 28 2011 new jersey enacted legislation which requires the board of public utilities to implement a longterm capacity agreement pilot program providing for new generating capacity in the state the new generating capacity would be required to participate and be accepted as a capacity resource in the pjm capacity market if the new jersey agreement for new capacity is implemented as required by the statute it could have a negative effect on capacity prices in pjm in future years on february 1 2011 a group of which we are a member initiated a proceeding at the ferc seeking changes in the pjm tariff to prevent interference with the capacity markets from efforts such as the new jersey legislation and the maryland request for proposals on february 9 2011 we joined a group of companies that filed suit in the us district court for new jersey asking the court to declare the new jersey legislation unconstitutional 

 

in addition as a result of initiatives at both the federal and state level new construction of renewable resources including solar and wind has occurred or is planned 

 

there are proposed upgrades to the transmission systems in some of the markets in which we operate that could mitigate the need for existing marginal generating capacity and for additional generating capacity to the extent that these upgrades are completed prices for electricity and capacity could be lower in some of our markets than they might otherwise be 

 

the prices for power and natural gas remain low compared to several years ago the energy gross margin from our generating facilities is negatively affected by these price levels for that portion of the volumes of generation that we have hedged we are generally economically neutral to subsequent changes in commodity prices because our realized gross margin will reflect the contractual prices of our power and fuel contracts we continue to add economic hedges including to maintain projected levels of cash flows from operations for 

future periods to help support continued compliance with the covenants in our debt and lease agreements we have implemented seasonal operating models at some of our facilities to address the effect of depressed power and commodity prices on the margins earned at these facilities 

 

concern over climate change and air emissions have led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts at the state and federal level the costs of compliance with such efforts could affect our ability to compete in the markets in which we operate especially with our coalfired generating facilities see “environmental regulation” later in the section for further discussion 

 

seasonality 

 

for information on the effect of seasonality on our business see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k and note 17 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

regulatory environment 

 

the electricity industry is regulated extensively at the federal state and local levels at the federal level the ferc has exclusive jurisdiction under the federal power act over sales of electricity at wholesale and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce each of our subsidiaries that owns or leases a generating facility selling at wholesale or that markets electricity at wholesale is a “public utility” subject to the ferc’s jurisdiction under the federal power act these subsidiaries must comply with certain ferc reporting requirements and fercapproved market rules and they are subject to ferc oversight of mergers and acquisitions the disposition of facilities under the ferc’s jurisdiction and the issuance of securities 

 

the ferc has authorized our subsidiaries that are public utilities under the federal power act to sell wholesale energy capacity and certain ancillary services at marketbased rates the majority of the output of the generating facilities owned by our subsidiaries is sold pursuant to this marketbased rate authorization although our potrero station sold its output under a costbased rmr agreement through february 2011 for which separate rate authorization was granted by the ferc the ferc could revoke or limit our marketbased rate authority if it determined that we possess insufficiently mitigated market power in a regional electricity market under the natural gas act our subsidiaries that sell natural gas for resale are deemed by the ferc to have blanket certificate authority to undertake these sales at marketbased rates 

 

the ferc requires that our public utility subsidiaries with marketbased rate authority and our subsidiaries with blanket certificate authority adhere to general rules against market manipulation as well as certain market behavior rules and codes of conduct if any of our subsidiaries were found to have engaged in market manipulation the ferc has the authority to impose a civil penalty of up to 1 million per day per violation in addition to the civil penalties if any of our subsidiaries were to engage in market manipulation or violate the market behavior rules or codes of conduct the ferc could require a disgorgement of profits or revoke the subsidiary’s marketbased rate authority or blanket certificate authority if the ferc were to revoke marketbased rate authority our affected public utility subsidiary would have to file a costbased rate schedule for all or some of its sales of electricity at wholesale 

 

in 2006 the ferc certified the nerc as the national energy reliability organization the nerc is now responsible for the development and enforcement of mandatory reliability standards for the electric power system each of our subsidiaries selling electricity at wholesale is responsible for complying with the reliability standards in the region in which it operates the nerc has the ability to assess financial penalties for noncompliance with the reliability standards which penalties can depending on the nature of the noncompliance be significant in addition to complying with the nerc standards each of our entities selling electricity at wholesale must comply with the reliability standards of the regional reliability council for the nerc region in which its sales occur 

the vast majority of our facilities operate in markets administered by isos and rtos in areas where isos or rtos control the regional transmission systems market participants have access to broader geographic markets than in regions without isos and rtos isos and rtos operate dayahead and realtime energy and ancillary services markets typically governed by fercapproved tariffs and market rules some isos and rtos also operate capacity markets changes to the applicable tariffs and market rules may be requested by the iso or rto or by other interested persons including market participants and state regulatory agencies and such proposed changes if approved by the ferc could have a significant effect on our operations and financial results although participation in isos and rtos by public utilities that own transmission has been and is expected to continue to be voluntary the majority of such public utilities in california illinois maryland massachusetts new jersey new york ohio pennsylvania and virginia have joined the applicable iso and rto 

 

our subsidiaries owning generating facilities have made such filings and received such orders as are necessary to obtain exempt wholesale generator status under the puhca and the ferc’s regulations thereunder provided all of our subsidiaries owning or leasing generating facilities continue to be exempt wholesale generators or are qualifying facilities under the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 we and our intermediate holding companies owning direct or indirect interests in those subsidiaries will remain exempt from the accounting record retention or reporting requirements that puhca imposes on “holding companies” 

 

state and local regulatory authorities historically have overseen the distribution and sale of electricity at retail to the ultimate end user as well as the siting permitting and construction of generating and transmission facilities our existing generating facilities are subject to a variety of state and local regulations including regulations regarding the environment health and safety and maintenance and expansion of the facilities 

 

we hedge economically a substantial portion of our eastern pjm coalfired baseload generation and certain of our other generation a significant portion of such hedges are financial swap transactions between genon midatlantic and financial counterparties that are senior unsecured obligations of such parties and do not require either party to post cash collateral either for initial margin or for securing exposure as a result of changes in power or natural gas prices the doddfrank act which was enacted in july 2010 in response to the global financial crisis increases the regulation of transactions involving otc derivative financial instruments the statute provides that standardized swap transactions between dealers and large market participants will have to be cleared and traded on an exchange or electronic platform although the provisions and legislative history of the doddfrank act provide strong evidence that market participants such as genon which utilize otc derivative financial instruments to hedge economically commercial risks are not to be subject to these clearing and exchangetrading requirements it is uncertain what the final implementing regulations to be issued by the cftc and sec will provide the effect of the doddfrank act on our business depends in large measure on pending cftc and sec rulemaking proceedings and in particular the final definitions for the key terms “swap dealer” and “major swap participant” in the doddfrank act the cftc and sec issued a proposed rulemaking to set final definitions for the terms “swap dealer” and “major swap participant” among others entities defined as swap dealers and major swap participants will face costly requirements for clearing and posting margin as well as additional requirements for reporting and business conduct as proposed the swap dealer definition in particular is ambiguous subjective and could be broad enough to encompass some energy companies such regulations could materially affect our ability to hedge economically our generation by reducing liquidity in the energy and commodity markets and if we were required to clear such transactions on exchanges or meet other requirements by significantly increasing the collateral costs associated with such activities see item 1a “risk factors—risks related to economic and financial market conditions—greater regulation of energy contracts” for additional information 

 

under the doddfrank act the cftc now has the authority to set position limits not only on contracts listed by designated contract markets but also for swap contracts that perform or affect a significant price discovery function as a result of the significant amendments to the commodity exchange act by the doddfrank act the cftc withdrew in august 2010 the january 2010 notice of proposed rulemaking in which it proposed to adopt allmonthscombined single nonspot month and spotmonth position limits for exchangelisted natural gas crude oil heating oil and gasoline futures and options contracts the cftc plans to issue a 

notice of rulemaking proposing position limits for regulated exempt commodity contracts including energy commodity contracts in early 2011 

 

in addition to the upcoming position limit rulemakings under the doddfrank act the cftc has designated and put into effect position limits for certain electricity and natural gas contracts designated as significant price discovery contracts including contracts based on caiso and pjm west hub locational marginal pricing that we trade on the intercontinental exchange inc designations put into effect to date have not had a material effect on our business we continue to monitor the rulemaking proceeding on the remaining contracts 

 

pjm region our eastern and western pjm generating facilities sell electricity into the markets operated by pjm we have access to the pjm transmission system pursuant to pjm’s open access transmission tariff pjm operates the pjm interchange energy market which is the region’s spot market for wholesale electricity provides ancillary services for its transmission customers performs transmission planning for the region and economically dispatches generating facilities pjm administers dayahead and realtime single clearing price markets and calculates electricity prices based on a locational marginal pricing model a locational marginal pricing model determines a price for energy at each node in a particular zone taking into account the limitations and losses on transmission of electricity into the zone resulting in a higher zonal price when less expensive energy cannot be imported from another zone generation owners in pjm are subject to mitigation which limits the prices that they may receive under certain specified conditions 

 

loadserving entities within pjm are required to have adequate sources of generating capacity our generating facilities located in the eastern and western pjm region that sell electricity into the pjm market participate in the rpm forward capacity market the pjm rpm capacity auctions are designed to provide forward prices for capacity that ensure that adequate resources are in place to meet the region’s demand requirements pjm has conducted seven rpm capacity auctions and we began receiving payments in june 2007 as a result of the first auction certain market participants have challenged the results of the rpm auctions that set capacity payments under the rpm provisions of pjm’s tariff for the twelve month periods beginning june 1 2008 june 1 2009 and june 1 2010 the ferc rejected those challenges and its orders were affirmed by the dc circuit see “complaint challenging capacity rates under the rpm provisions of pjm’s tariff” in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the challenges 

 

since 2008 annual auctions have been conducted to procure capacity three years prior to each delivery period the first annual auction took place in may 2008 for the provision of capacity from june 1 2011 to may 31 2012 pjm continues to revise elements of the rpm provisions of its tariff both pursuant to those provisions and on its own volition or at the request of its stakeholders these revisions must be filed with and approved by the ferc and we either individually or as part of a group are actively involved at the ferc to protect our interests see “competitive environment” for our involvement at the ferc 

 

miso our miso generating facilities sell electricity into the markets operated by miso miso manages the transmission system and provides open access to its transmission system and markets to all market participants on an equal basis miso operates physical and financial energy markets using a locational marginal pricing model which calculates a price for every generator and load point within miso similar to the model utilized by pjm miso operates dayahead and realtime markets into which generators can offer to provide energy miso does not administer a centralized capacity market miso implemented the ancillary services market regulation and operating reserves on january 6 2009 and implemented an enforceable planning reserve margin for each planning year effective june 1 2009 a feature of the ancillary services market is the addition of scarcity pricing that during supply shortages can raise the combined price of energy and ancillary services significantly higher than the previous cap of 1000mwh 

 

california our california generating facilities are located inside the caiso’s control area on april 1 2009 the caiso implemented its market redesign and technology update mrtu mrtu’s key components include locational marginal pricing of energy similar to the rtoiso markets in the east a dayahead market in addition to the existing realtime market a more effective congestion management system and an increase in the existing bid caps the caiso also schedules transmission transactions and arranges for necessary ancillary services most sales in california are pursuant to bilateral contracts but a significant 

percentage of electrical energy is sold in the dayahead and realtime market the caiso does not operate a wholesale capacity market 

 

other operations our bowline generating facility participates in a market administered by the nyiso the nyiso provides statewide transmission service under a single tariff and interfaces with neighboring market control areas to account for transmission congestion and losses the nyiso calculates energy prices using a locational marginal pricing model the nyiso also administers a spot market for energy as well as markets for installed capacity and services that are ancillary to transmission service the nyiso’s locational capacity market utilizes a demand curve mechanism to determine monthly capacity prices to be paid to suppliers for three capacity zones new york city long island and rest of state our facility is located in the rest of state capacity zone 

 

our canal kendall and martha’s vineyard generating facilities participate in a market administered by isone genon energy management is a member of the new england power pool which is a voluntary association of electric utilities and other market participants in connecticut maine massachusetts new hampshire rhode island and vermont and which functions as an advisory organization to isone as the rto for the new england region isone is responsible for the operation of transmission systems and for the administration and settlement of the wholesale electric energy capacity and ancillary services markets isone utilizes a locational marginal pricing model similar to the model used in pjm miso and nyiso 

 

on march 6 2006 a settlement proposal was filed with the ferc among isone and multiple market participants for the fcm under which annual capacity auctions would be conducted for supply three years in advance of provision the settlement provided for a fouryear transition period during which capacity suppliers receive a set price for their capacity commencing on december 1 2006 with price escalators through may 31 2010 beginning december 1 2006 our generating facilities began receiving capacity revenues under the fcm transition period on june 1 2010 our generating facilities began receiving capacity revenues based upon the auction results 

 

our choctaw sabine indian river and osceola generating facilities located in the southeast region do not operate in a market that is operated by an rto or iso opportunities to negotiate bilateral contracts and longterm transactions with investor owned utilities municipalities and cooperatives exist within this region in addition to entering into bilateral transactions there is a limited opportunity to sell into the shortterm market access to the transmission system in this region to which the generating facility is interconnected is governed by the ferc approved terms and conditions of the applicable transmission provider’s open access transmission tariff in the entergy subregion which the choctaw facility can access southwest power pool has been designated as the independent coordinator of transmission in this capacity the independent coordinator of transmission provides oversight of the entergy transmission system 

 

environmental regulation 

 

our business is subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities we must comply with applicable laws and regulations and obtain and comply with the terms of government issued permits these requirements relate to a broad range of our activities including the discharge of materials into the air water and soil the proper handling of solid hazardous and toxic materials and waste noise and safety and health standards applicable to the workplace some of these requirements are under revision or in dispute and some new requirements are pending or under consideration our costs of complying with environmental laws and permits are substantial including significant environmental capital expenditures see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—capital expenditures and capital resources” for additional information 

 

air emissions regulations 

 

the clean air act and similar state laws impose significant environmental requirements on our generating facilities the clean air act mandates a broad range of requirements concerning air quality air emissions operating practices and pollution control equipment under the clean air act the epa sets naaqs for pollutants thought to be harmful to public health and the environment including so 2  no x ozone 

and fine particulate matter pm25 most of our facilities are located in or near areas that are classified by the epa as not achieving certain naaqs nonattainment areas the relevant naaqs have become more stringent and we expect that trend to continue as a result of such classification and the manner in which regulators seek to achieve the naaqs our operations generally are subject to more stringent air pollution requirements than those applicable to facilities located elsewhere the states are generally free to impose requirements that are more stringent than those imposed by the federal government we expect increased regulation at both the federal and state levels of our air emissions we maintain a comprehensive compliance strategy to address these continuing and new requirements complying with increasingly stringent naaqs may require us to install and operate additional emissions control equipment at some of our facilities if we decide to continue to operate such facilities such costs could be material significant air regulatory programs to which we are subject are described below 

 

clean air interstate rule in 2005 the epa promulgated the cair which established in the eastern united states so 2 and no x capandtrade programs applicable directly to states and indirectly to generating facilities the no x capandtrade program has two components an annual program and an ozone season program the cair so 2 capandtrade program builds off the existing acid rain capandtrade program but requires generating facilities to surrender twice as many allowances to cover emissions from 2010 through 2014 and approximately three times as many allowances starting in 2015 florida illinois maryland mississippi new jersey new york ohio pennsylvania texas and virginia are subject to the cair’s so 2 trading program and both its no x trading programs massachusetts is subject only to the cair’s ozone season no x trading program these capandtrade programs were to be implemented in two phases with the first phase going into effect in 2009 for no x and 2010 for so 2 and more stringent caps going into effect in 2015 various parties challenged the epa’s adoption of the cair and on july 11 2008 the dc circuit in state of north carolina v environmental protection agency issued an opinion that would have vacated the cair various parties filed requests for rehearing with the dc circuit and on december 23 2008 the dc circuit issued a second opinion in which it granted rehearing only to the extent that it remanded the case to the epa without vacating the cair accordingly the cair will remain effective until it is replaced by a rule consistent with the dc circuit’s opinions the states in which we operate that are subject to cair ie florida illinois maryland massachusetts mississippi new jersey new york ohio pennsylvania texas and virginia have promulgated regulations implementing the federal cair 

 

the epa has stated that it expects to finalize the regulations to replace the cair in 2011 and on august 2 2010 the epa proposed a rule the transport rule to replace the cair the epa has sought comment on the proposed transport rule as well as several alternatives if finalized the cair replacement proposal and each of the alternatives would impose more stringent emission reductions than were required under the cair the epa’s proposed replacement rule would establish an emissions budget for each of thirtyone eastern and midwestern states and the district of columbia and would allow only limited interstate trading for so 2  generating facilities in a region comprised of georgia illinois indiana iowa kentucky michigan missouri new york north carolina ohio pennsylvania tennessee virginia west virginia and wisconsin would be subject to a more stringent cap on so 2 emissions than the other states subject to the rule and would not be allowed to use emissions allowances from sources in a separate region comprised of alabama connecticut delaware the district of columbia florida kansas louisiana maryland massachusetts minnesota nebraska new jersey and south carolina for both so 2 and no x  interstate trading of emissions allowances would be allowed only to the extent that the total number of emissions allowances used within a particular state did not exceed the state’s budgeted allowances plus a “variability limit” intended to account for the variability of emissions because of changes in demand for electricity timing of maintenance activities and unit outages if total emissions allowances used within a state in a year exceed the annual budget plus the variability limit then owners of generating facilities in that state that are deemed responsible for the state’s exceedance would be required to surrender additional allowances the two alternatives on which the epa sought comment would further restrict trading under the first alternative only intrastate trading of allowances would be allowed the second alternative would establish an emissions limit for each generating facility with some averaging allowed in january 2011 the epa also sought comment on two additional methods of allocating allowances finally the epa has also stated that it may issue a subsequent more stringent rule if it concludes that recent or planned revisions to the particulate matter and ozone naaqs make 

necessary more stringent limits on so 2 and no x emissions from electric generating facilities we continue to monitor developments related to the epa’s proposed options to replace the existing cair 

 

the effect on our business of these pending regulations and whether we elect to install additional controls is uncertain and depends on the content and timing of the regulations the expected effect of the regulations on wholesale power prices and allowance prices as well as the cost of controls profitability of our generating facilities market conditions at the time and the likelihood of co 2 regulation we may choose to retire certain of our units rather than install additional controls 

 

the costs associated with more stringent environmental air quality requirements may result in coalfired generating facilities including some of ours being retired although conditions may change under current and forecasted market conditions installations of additional scrubbers would not be economic at most of our unscrubbed coalfired facilities any such retirements could contribute to improving supply and demand fundamentals for the remaining fleet any resulting increased demand for gas could increase the spread between gas and coal prices which would also benefit the remaining coalfired generating facilities 

 

maryland healthy air act the maryland healthy air act was enacted in april 2006 and requires reductions in so 2  no x and mercury emissions from large coalfired power facilities the state law also required maryland to join the rggi which is discussed below the maryland healthy air act and the regulations adopted by mde to implement that act impose limits for a emissions of no x in 2009 with further reductions in 2012 including sublimits during the ozone season and b emissions of so 2 in 2010 with further reductions in 2013 the maryland healthy air act also imposes restrictions on emissions of mercury beginning in 2010 with further reductions in 2013 the maryland healthy air act imposes fixed limits and owners of power facilities may not exceed these fixed limits by purchasing emissions allowances to comply 

 

we installed scrubbers at our chalk point dickerson and morgantown coalfired units in addition we installed scr systems at the morgantown coalfired units and one of the chalk point coalfired units and a selective auto catalytic reduction system at the other chalk point coalfired unit we also installed selective noncatalytic reduction systems at the three dickerson coalfired units these controls are capable of reducing emissions of so 2  no x and mercury by approximately 98 90 and 80 respectively for three of our largest coalfired units the control equipment we have installed allows our maryland generating facilities to comply with a the first phase of the cair without having to purchase emissions allowances and b all of the requirements of the maryland healthy air act 

 

in 2009 we had planned outages to complete the installation of the scrubbers during those outages we also performed significant maintenance activities we expect to invest 1674 billion in capital expenditures to comply with the requirements for so 2  no x and mercury emissions under the maryland healthy air act at december 31 2010 we had invested 1519 billion of the 1674 billion in july 2007 our subsidiaries genon midatlantic and genon chalk point entered into an agreement with stone  webster inc for epc services relating to the installation of the scrubbers described above the cost under the agreement was approximately 11 billion and is a part of the 1674 billion described above see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements under “scrubber contract litigation” for further discussion 

 

new jersey in april 2009 the new jersey department of environmental protection finalized a regulation requiring a twophase reduction in no x emissions from combustion turbines in new jersey phase i requires reductions during high electricity demand days and runs from may 2009 through 2014 under our compliance plan we operate enhanced no x controls at our shawville pennsylvania generating facility upwind from new jersey on high energy demand days phase ii requires the installation of emission controls on all but one of our new jersey generating facilities gilbert glen gardner sayreville and werner by may 1 2015 the new jersey department of environmental protection is evaluating proposed changes to its high electricity demand days regulations and may defer for two years in part or in whole requirements for reduction in no x emissions from combustion turbines if we elect to install these controls we could incur capital expenditures of up to approximately 190 million primarily during 2014 to 2017 assuming the twoyear deferral described above our initial phase ii control plan was filed with the state of new jersey and our decision on investments should occur by 2012 

haps regulations in 2005 the epa issued the camr which would have limited total annual mercury emissions from coalfired power plants across the united states through a twophased capandtrade program in february 2008 the dc circuit vacated the camr and the epa’s decision not to regulate coal and oilfired electric utility steam generating units under section 112 of the clean air act which requires the epa to develop mact standards for controlling emissions of all haps including mercury the epa and a group representing electricity generators sought review of the dc circuit’s decision by the united states supreme court in february 2009 the epa filed to withdraw its petition for review stating that it intends to promulgate alternative regulations for electricity generators under section 112 of the clean air act and the united states supreme court subsequently denied the petition for review as a result of the dc circuit decision coalfired and oilfired generating facilities are now subject to regulation under the section of the clean air act that generally requires the epa to develop mact standards to control haps including mercury from each covered facility although the epa has announced that it will develop mact standards for mercury and other haps it has not yet promulgated such standards the mact standards may require us to install and operate additional emissions control equipment at some of our facilities the cost of which may be material the epa has collected emissions data which will be used to develop such standards our maryland coalfired units already are subject to mercury limits under the maryland healthy air act as described above many of our coalfired units will emit less mercury as a result of the so 2 and no x controls that have been installed in the interim a number of states including pennsylvania pursued mercury regulations in december 2009 the pennsylvania supreme court upheld a lower court’s determination that the proposed pennsylvania mercury rule was unlawful and unenforceable 

 

new source review enforcement initiative the epa and various states are investigating compliance of coalfired electric generating facilities with the preconstruction permitting requirements of the clean air act known as “new source review” in the past decade the epa has made information requests for our avon lake chalk point cheswick conemaugh dickerson elrama keystone morgantown new castle niles portland potomac river shawville and titus generating facilities we are corresponding or have corresponded with the epa regarding all of these requests if a violation is determined to have occurred at any of the facilities our subsidiary owning or leasing the facilities may be responsible for the cost of purchasing and installing emissions control equipment the cost of which may be material several of our generating facilities already have installed a variety of emissions control equipment if such a violation is determined to have occurred after our subsidiaries acquired or leased the facilities or if occurring prior to the acquisition or lease is determined to constitute a continuing violation our subsidiary owning or leasing the facility at issue could also be subject to fines and penalties by the state or federal government for the period after its acquisition or lease of the facility the cost of which may be material although applicable bankruptcy law may bar such liability for the chalk point dickerson morgantown and potomac river generating facilities for periods prior to january 3 2006 when the plan became effective 

 

regulation of greenhouse gases including the rggi concern over climate change has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts at the state and federal level to limit greenhouse gas emissions especially co 2  one such effort is the rggi a multistate initiative in the eastern pjm and northeast outlining a capandtrade program to reduce co 2 emissions from electric generating units with capacity of 25 mw or greater the rggi program calls for signatory states which include maryland massachusetts new jersey and new york to stabilize co 2 emissions to an established baseline from 2009 through 2014 followed by a 25 reduction each year from 2015 through 2018 each of these four states has promulgated regulations implementing the rggi complying with the rggi could have a material adverse effect upon our operations and our operating costs depending upon the availability and cost of emissions allowances and the extent to which such costs may be offset by higher market prices to recover increases in operating costs caused by the rggi as contemplated in a memorandum of understanding among the participating states regional greenhouse gas initiative inc is comprehensively reviewing the program which may cause the participating states to change the manner in which the program is administered and may increase our cost to comply 

 

during 2010 we produced approximately 173 million tons of co 2 at our maryland massachusetts new jersey and new york generating facilities for a total cost of 34 million under the rggi including all former mirant generating facilities for 2010 and all former rri energy generating facilities for december 2010 in 

2011 we expect to produce approximately 156 million tons of co 2 at our maryland massachusetts new jersey and new york generating facilities the rggi regulations required those facilities to obtain allowances to emit co 2 beginning in 2009 annual allowances generally were not granted to existing sources of such emissions instead allowances have been made available for such facilities by purchase through periodic auctions conducted quarterly or through subsequent purchase from a party that holds allowances sold through a quarterly auction 

 

the tenth auction of allowances by the rggi states was held on december 1 2010 the clearing price for the approximately 248 million allowances sold in the auction allocated for use beginning in the first control period 20092011 was 186 per ton the clearing price for the approximately 12 million allowances sold in the auction allocated for use beginning in the second control period 20122014 was 186 per ton the allowances sold in this auction may be used for compliance in any of the rggi states further auctions will occur quarterly with the next auction scheduled for march 2011 

 

in california emissions of greenhouse gases are governed by california’s global warming solutions act ab 32 which requires that statewide greenhouse gas emissions be reduced to 1990 levels by 2020 in december 2008 the carb approved a scoping plan for implementing ab 32 the scoping plan requires that the carb adopt a capandtrade regulation by january 2011 and that the cap and trade program begin in 2012 the carb’s schedule for developing regulations to implement ab 32 is being coordinated with the schedule of the wci for development of a regional capandtrade program for greenhouse gas emissions through the wci california is working with other western states and canadian provinces to coordinate and implement a regional capandtrade program in october 2010 the carb released its proposed capandtrade regulation for public comment which the carb approved in december 2010 our california generating facilities will be required to comply beginning in 2012 the recently adopted capandtrade regulation and any other plans rules and programs approved to implement ab 32 could adversely affect the costs of operating the facilities 

 

in july 2008 the pennsylvania climate change act was adopted this legislation requires development of reports of the effects of climate change in pennsylvania and potential economic opportunities resulting from mitigation strategies it requires development of an annual statelevel greenhouse gas emissions inventory and baseline a voluntary registry and establishment of costeffective statelevel strategies for reducing or offsetting greenhouse gases the climate change advisory committee established by the act published a climate change action plan in december 2009 the plan includes numerous recommendations to reduce 2020 greenhouse gas emissions in the state by 30 percent below year 2000 levels recommendations affecting fossil power generation are carbon capture and sequestration at selected coalfired units and minimum efficiency improvements the plans also recommend greenhouse gas performance standards for new power plants 

 

in august 2008 massachusetts adopted the climate protection act which establishes a program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly over the next 40 years under the climate protection act the madep has established a reporting and verification system for statewide greenhouse gas emissions including emissions from generating facilities producing all electricity consumed in massachusetts and determined the state’s greenhouse gas emissions level in 1990 under the climate change act the maeea is to establish statewide greenhouse gas emissions limits effective beginning in 2020 that will reduce such emissions from the 1990 levels by a range of 10 to 25 beginning in 2020 with the reduction increasing to 80 below 1990 levels by 2050 in setting these limits the maeea is to consider the potential costs and benefits of various reduction measures including emissions limits for electric generating facilities and may consider the use of marketbased compliance mechanisms a violation of the emissions limits established under the climate protection act may result in a civil penalty of up to 25000 per day implementation of the climate protection act could have a material adverse effect on how we operate our massachusetts generating facilities and the costs of operating those facilities on december 29 2010 the maeea established a limit for 2020 that is 25 less than the 1990 level 

 

in april 2009 the maryland general assembly passed the maryland act which became effective in october 2009 the maryland act requires a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in maryland by 25 from 2006 levels by 2020 however this provision of the maryland act is only in effect through 2016 unless a 

subsequent statutory enactment extends its effective period the maryland act requires the mde to develop a proposed implementation plan to achieve these reductions by the end of 2011 and to adopt a final plan by the end of 2012 

 

in light of the united states supreme court ruling in massachusetts v epa that greenhouse gases fit within the clean air act’s definition of “air pollutant” the epa has proposed and promulgated regulations regarding the emission of greenhouse gases in september 2009 the epa promulgated a rule that requires owners of facilities in many sectors of the economy including power generation to report annually to the epa the quantity and source of greenhouse gas emissions released from those facilities in addition to this reporting requirement the epa has promulgated several rules that address greenhouse gas emissions in december 2009 under a portion of the clean air act that regulates vehicles the epa determined that elevated concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere endanger the public’s health and welfare through their contribution to climate change endangerment finding in april 2010 the epa finalized a rule to regulate greenhouse gases from vehicles beginning in model year 2012 in april 2010 the epa also issued its “reconsideration of interpretation of regulations that determine pollutants covered by clean air act permitting programs” which addresses the scope of pollutants subject to certain permitting requirements under the clean air act as well as when such requirements become effective the epa has stated that because of the vehicle rule emissions of greenhouse gases from new stationary sources such as power plants and from major modifications to such sources are subject to certain clean air act permitting requirements as of january 2011 these permitting requirements will require such sources to use “best available control technology” to limit their greenhouse gases we expect various parties to seek judicial review of these regulations and that the legal challenges to these regulations will not be resolved for several years the additional substantive requirements under the clean air act that may apply or may come to apply to stationary sources such as power plants are not clear at this time 

 

in december 2010 the epa announced that it was starting the process of developing regulations under the new source performance standard section of the clean air act that would affect new and existing fossilfueled generating facilities the epa expects to propose regulations by july 2011 and to finalize such regulations by may 2012 

 

in addition to the state and regional regulatory matters described above various bills have been proposed in congress to govern co 2 emissions from generating facilities current proposals include a capandtrade system that would require us to purchase allowances for some or all of the co 2 emitted by our generating facilities if co 2 regulation becomes more stringent we expect the demand for gas andor renewable sources of electricity will increase over time although we expect that market prices for electricity would increase following such regulation and would allow us to recover a portion of the cost of these allowances we cannot predict with any certainty the actual increases in costs such regulation could impose upon us or our ability to recover such cost increases through higher market rates for electricity and such regulation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of operations financial position and cash flows it is possible that congress will take action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions within the next several years the form and timing of any final legislation will be influenced by political and economic factors and is uncertain at this time implementation of a co 2 capandtrade program in addition to other emission control requirements could increase the likelihood of coalfired generating facility retirements during 2010 we produced approximately 207 million tons of co 2 at our generating facilities including all former mirant generating facilities for 2010 and all former rri energy generating facilities for december 3 to december 31 2010 our former rri energy generating facilities produced approximately 204 million tons of co 2 for january through december 2 2010 we expect to produce approximately 403 million total tons of co 2 at our generating facilities in 2011 

 

water regulations 

 

we are required under the clean water act to comply with intake and discharge requirements requirements for technological controls and operating practices to discharge water we generally need permits required by the clean water act such permits typically are subject to review every five years as with air quality regulations federal and state water regulations are expected to impose additional and more stringent 

requirements or limitations in the future this is particularly the case for regulatory requirements governing cooling water intake structures which are subject to regulation under section 316b of the clean water act the 316b regulations a 2007 decision by the united states court of appeals for the second circuit the second circuit in riverkeeper inc et al v epa  in which the court remanded to the epa for reconsideration numerous provisions of the epa’s section 316b regulations for existing power plants has created substantial uncertainty about exactly what technologies or other measures will be needed to satisfy section 316b requirements in the future and when any new requirements will be imposed following that ruling by the second circuit the epa in 2007 suspended its 316b regulations for existing power plants various parties sought review of the second circuit’s decision by the united states supreme court and it granted those requests with respect to whether the epa could permissibly weigh costs versus benefits in determining what requirements to impose on april 1 2009 the supreme court reversed the second circuit ruling that the epa had permissibly relied on costbenefit analysis in setting standards for cooling water intake structures for existing power plants and authorizing sitespecific variances the supreme court’s ruling did not alter other aspects of the second circuit’s decision significant uncertainty remains regarding the effect of the supreme court’s decision on the epa’s 316b regulations for existing power plants and what technologies or other measures will be needed to satisfy section 316b regulations the epa also is in the process of updating its technologybased regulations regarding discharges from power plants the epa has collected information from numerous power plants to inform this rulemaking the new standards have not yet been proposed accordingly we cannot predict their effect on our business 

 

at our shawville pennsylvania facility we could be required to install a cooling tower by late 2013 at one or more of its units in order to comply with our permit if we decide to install one or more cooling towers we could invest approximately 160 million primarily during 2012 to 2014 under current and forecasted market conditions such capital expenditures may not be justified we are continuing to evaluate alternatives and appealing the permit see discussion below under “shawville npdes permit appeal” 

 

oncethrough cooling in october 2010 the california state water resources control board’s state water board’s policy on the use of coastal and estuarine waters for power plant cooling oncethrough cooling policy became effective compliance options for our affected generating units include transitioning to a closedcycle cooling system retiring or submitting an alternative plan that meets equivalent mitigation criteria the specified compliance date for our pittsburg and contra costa generating facilities is december 31 2017 and for our mandalay and ormond beach generating facilities the date is december 31 2020 we will shut down the contra costa generating facility in april 2013 subject to regulatory approval we are analyzing compliance options for the remaining affected generating units and for certain of our california generating facilities the oncethrough cooling policy could have a material adverse effect on how we operate those facilities and the costs of operating those facilities in october 2010 we and several other companies jointly filed a lawsuit in california superior court challenging the state water board’s issuance of the oncethrough cooling policy on various procedural and substantive grounds the lawsuit seeks a writ directing the state water board to vacate and set aside approval of the oncethrough cooling policy 

 

endangered species acts genon delta’s use of water from the sacramentosan joaquin delta at its contra costa and pittsburg generating facilities potentially affects certain fish species protected under the federal endangered species act and the california endangered species act genon delta therefore must maintain authorization under both statutes to engage in operations that could result in a take of ie cause harm to fish of the protected species in january and february 2006 genon delta received correspondence from the united states fish and wildlife service and the us army corps of engineers expressing the view that the federal endangered species act take authorization for the contra costa and pittsburg generating facilities was no longer in effect as a result of changed circumstances genon delta disagreed with the agencies’ characterization of its take authorization as no longer being in effect in october 2007 genon delta received correspondence from the united states fish and wildlife service the national marine fisheries service and the army corps of engineers clarifying that genon delta continued to be authorized to take four species of fish protected under the federal endangered species act the agencies have initiated a process that will review the environmental effects of genon delta’s water usage including effects on the protected species of fish that process could lead to changes in the manner in which genon delta can use river water for the 

operation of the contra costa and pittsburg generating facilities as discussed further in note 5c to our consolidated financial statements we plan to shut down the contra costa generating facility in april 2013 

 

by letter dated september 27 2007 the coalition for a sustainable delta four water districts and an individual the delta noticing parties provided notice to us of their intent to file suit alleging that genon delta has violated and continues to violate the federal endangered species act through the operation of its contra costa and pittsburg generating facilities the delta noticing parties contend that the facilities use of water drawn from the sacramentosan joaquin delta for cooling purposes results in harm to four species of fish listed as endangered species the delta noticing parties assert that genon delta’s authorizations to take ie cause harm to those species a biological opinion and incidental take statement issued by the national marine fisheries service on october 17 2002 for three of the fish species and a biological opinion and incidental take statement issued by the united states fish and wildlife service on november 4 2002 for the fourth fish species have been violated by genon delta and no longer apply to permit the effects on the four fish species caused by the operation of the contra costa and pittsburg generating facilities following receipt of these letters genon delta received in october 2007 the correspondence noted above from the united states fish and wildlife service the national marine fisheries service and the united states army corps of engineers the corps clarifying genon delta’s continuing right to take the four species of fish in a subsequent letter the coalition for a sustainable delta also alleged violations of the national environmental policy act and the california endangered species act associated with the operation of genon delta’s generating facilities on may 14 2009 the coalition for a sustainable delta kern county water agency and an individual sent a new notice of intent to sue to the corps alleging that the corps had violated the federal endangered species act by issuing permits related to the operation of genon delta’s contra costa and pittsburg generating facilities without ensuring that conservation measures would be implemented to minimize and mitigate the harm to the four endangered fish species and their habitat allegedly resulting from such operation genon delta disputes the allegations made by the delta noticing parties and those made in the may 14 2009 notice 

 

on february 11 2010 genon delta entered into a settlement agreement with the delta noticing parties the parties to the may 14 2009 notice of intent to sue and the corps the settlement agreement provides for the delta noticing parties and the parties to the may 14 2009 notice of intent to sue to withdraw the two notices of intent to sue and to release all claims described in those notices the settlement agreement obligated genon delta to seek approval from the corps the united states fish and wildlife service and the national marine fisheries service to amend its plan then in effect for monitoring entrainment and impingement of aquatic species caused by the operation of its generating facilities to increase monitoring during periods the facilities are operating and those approvals have been obtained the settlement agreement requires the corps to use its best efforts to conclude ongoing consultations with the united states fish and wildlife service and the national marine fisheries service regarding the environmental effects of genon delta’s water usage in a timely manner and allows the delta noticing parties and the parties to the may 14 2009 notice of intent to sue to issue new notices of intent to sue if such consultations are not completed by october 31 2011 

 

in november 2009 genon delta signed a second amendment to a memorandum of agreement with the california department of fish and game the amendment requires genon delta to prepare a planning and feasibility study for potential habitat restoration projects and extends by 16 months to march 1 2011 the deadline for submitting an application for a new permit authorizing genon delta to take the protected fish species affected by the operation of its facilities the amendment extends genon delta’s existing authorization for take of fish species protected under the california endangered species act until the california department of fish and game completes its consideration of the application for the new permit 

 

potrero national pollution discharge elimination system permit on june 8 2006 bayviewhunters point community advocates and communities for a better environment filed a petition challenging the issuance of the npdes permit for our potrero generating facility on february 8 2007 bayviewhunters point community advocates and communities for a better environment filed another petition with a request to amend their initial petition on march 21 2007 the california state water resources control board notified the parties that petitioners requested that as of march 19 2007 the two petitions be moved from active status to abeyance those petitions currently remain in abeyance additionally on june 15 2007 

bayviewhunters point community advocates and communities for a better environment and san francisco baykeeper filed a third petition requesting that the npdes permits for potrero and genon delta’s pittsburg generating facility be reopened the state water resources control board denied that petition on november 27 2007 as discussed further in notes 5 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements the caiso has determined that the potrero generating facility is no longer needed for reliability and accordingly we shut it down on february 28 2011 

 

kendall npdes and surface water discharge permit on september 26 2006 the epa issued to genon kendall an npdes renewal permit for the kendall cogeneration facility the same permit was concurrently issued by the madep as a state swd permit and was accompanied by madep’s earlier issued water quality certificate under section 401 of the clean water act these permits sought to impose new temperature limits at various points in the charles river an extensive temperature water quality and biological monitoring program and a requirement to develop and install a barrier net system to reduce fish impingement and entrainment the provisions regulating the thermal discharge could have caused substantial curtailments of the operations of the kendall generating facility genon kendall appealed the permits in three proceedings a appeal of the npdes permit to the epa’s environmental appeals board b appeal of the swd permit to the madep and c appeal of the water quality certification to the madep the effect of the permits was stayed pending the outcome of these appeals on march 6 2008 the epa and the madep issued a draft permit modification to address the 316b provisions of the permit that would have required modifications to the intake structure for the kendall generating facility to add fine and coarse mesh barrier exclusion technologies and to install a mechanism to sweep organisms away from the intake structure through an induced water flow on may 1 2008 genon kendall submitted comments on the draft permit modification objecting to the new requirements on december 19 2008 the epa and the madep issued final permit modifications to address the 316b regulations those final permit modifications did not substantially modify the requirements proposed in the draft modifications and on february 2 2009 genon kendall filed an appeal of those modifications 

 

in october 2010 genon kendall submitted a permit modification request to the epa and madep that requested modification of the 2006 permits as previously modified in 2008 to reflect revised permit terms agreed upon among genon kendall the epa and madep as part of a settlement of the permit renewal proceedings pending before epa and madep the settlement contemplates that an additional steam pipeline will be installed across the charles river under the longfellow bridge to allow genon kendall to make additional steam sales to trigenboston energy corporation in boston and that genon kendall will install a back pressure steam turbine and air cooled condenser at the kendall generating facility this new pipeline and equipment once operational would allow genon kendall to reduce significantly its use of water from the charles river on october 25 2010 epa and madep issued the proposed revised permits the 2010 kendall permits as draft permit modifications for public comment on december 17 2010 the epa and madep issued final permits that became effective on february 1 2011 the 2010 kendall permits will limit genon kendall to drawing no more than 32 million gallons of water per day from the river under normal operations impose temperature limits similar to the 2006 permits and require monitoring of temperatures at various points in the river when the kendall generating facility is discharging water to the river the 2010 kendall permits do not require the installation of barrier nets or modifications to the intake structure at the facility because river water will no longer be used for oncethrough cooling under normal operations once the new pipeline and equipment have been installed genon kendall expects the 2010 kendall permits to impose significantly less risk that operations of the facility would have to be curtailed to maintain compliance with the temperature limits as part of its settlement with the epa and madep the epa and madep issued administrative orders that defer application of the new limit on the amount of river water used by the kendall cogenerating facility and the new temperature limits imposed by the 2010 kendall permits until installation has been completed of the new pipeline the back pressure steam turbine and the air cooled condenser which is not expected to occur until 2015 

 

canal npdes and swd permit on august 1 2008 the epa issued to genon canal an npdes renewal permit for the canal generating facility the same permit was concurrently issued by madep as a state swd permit and was accompanied by madep’s earlier water quality certificate under section 401 of 

the clean water act the new permit imposes a requirement on genon canal to install closed cycle cooling or an alternative technology that will reduce the entrainment of marine organisms by the canal generating facility to levels equivalent to what would be achieved by closed cycle cooling genon canal appealed the npdes permit to the epa’s environmental appeals board and appealed the surface water discharge and the water quality certificate to the madep on december 4 2008 the epa requested a stay to the appeal proceedings and withdrew provisions related to the closed cycle cooling requirements the epa has renoticed these provisions as draft conditions for additional public comment genon canal filed comments on january 29 2009 stating that installing closed cycle cooling at the canal generating facility was not justified and that without some costrecovery mechanism the cost would make continued operation of the facility uneconomic while the appeals of the renewal permit are pending the effect of any contested permit provisions is stayed and the canal generating facility will continue to operate under its current npdes permit we are unable to predict the outcome of this proceeding 

 

conemaugh npdes permit in april 2007 two environmental groups sued genon northeast management company in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania alleging the inappropriate discharge of five metals to the conemaugh river from the conemaugh generating facility we think that an administrative consent order and agreement signed in 2004 precludes this lawsuit and the two plaintiffs do not have standing in october 2010 the court denied our motion to dismiss on these two grounds a trial has been scheduled for june 2011 

 

seward npdes permit appeal the padep issued the seward generating facility a renewed npdes permit on july 19 2010 on september 7 2010 pennenvironment defenders of wildlife and the sierra club challenged this permit these environmental groups assert that there was insufficient public notice of the final permit they also assert that padep failed to a undertake a “casebycase” analysis to set technologybased effluent limitations b require sufficient monitoring of temperature changes or a compliance schedule or to otherwise address certain alleged violations c address the discharge of “underground seeps to groundwater” and d properly consider the need for additional water qualitybased effluent limitations we disagree with these allegations and think that all of the issues raised have been adequately and appropriately addressed 

 

shawville npdes permit appeal the padep issued the shawville generating facility a renewed npdes permit on august 9 2010 that permit requires installation of cooling towers or reduction in plant operation by september 1 2013 to reduce thermal effects on the west branch of the susquehanna river which the shawville generating facility uses for cooling water we have appealed the permit because the deadlines for installation of cooling towers are both unachievable and inconsistent with the timeframe for making investment decisions regarding anticipated air quality regulations—the transport rule which is expected to replace the cair and the mact rule which is expected to regulate emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants in addition the pennsylvania fish  boat commission appealed the permit alleging that the schedule for and form of thermal limits on the plant are not sufficiently stringent 

 

npdes and state pollutant discharge elimination system permit renewals in addition to the various npdes proceedings described above proceedings are currently pending for renewal of the npdes or state pollutant discharge elimination system permits at many of our generating facilities and ash disposal sites in general the epa and the state agencies responsible for implementing the provisions of the clean water act applicable to the intake of water and discharge of effluent by electric generating facilities have been making the requirements imposed upon such facilities more stringent over time with respect to each of these permit renewal proceedings the permit renewal proceeding could take years to resolve and the agency or agencies involved could impose requirements upon the entity owning the facility that require significant capital expenditures limit the times at which the facility can operate or increase operations and maintenance costs materially 

 

byproducts wastes hazardous materials and contamination 

 

our facilities are subject to laws and regulations governing waste management the federal resource conservation and recovery act of 1976 and many analogous state laws contains comprehensive requirements for the handling of solid and hazardous wastes the generation of electricity produces nonhazardous and 

hazardous materials and we incur substantial costs to store and dispose of waste materials the epa and the states in which we operate coalfired units may develop new regulations that impose additional requirements on facilities that store or dispose of materials remaining after the combustion of fossil fuels including coal ash if so we may be required to change our current waste management practices at some facilities and incur additional costs 

 

in june 2010 the epa proposed two alternatives for regulating byproducts of coal combustion eg ash and gypsum under the federal resource conservation and recovery act of 1976 under the first proposal these byproducts would be regulated as solid wastes under the second proposal these byproducts would be regulated as “special wastes” in a manner similar to the regulation of hazardous waste with an exception for beneficial reuse of these byproducts the second alternative would impose significantly more stringent requirements on and increase materially the cost of disposal of coal combustion byproducts 

 

our contra costa pittsburg and potrero generating facilities have areas of soil and groundwater contamination in 1998 prior to our acquisition of those facilities from pge consultants for pge conducted soil and groundwater investigations at those facilities which revealed contamination the consultants conducting the investigation estimated the aggregate cleanup costs at those facilities could be as much as 60 million pursuant to the terms of the purchase and sale agreement with pge pge has responsibility for the containment or capping of all soil and groundwater contamination and the disposition of up to 60000 cubic yards of contaminated soil from the potrero generating facility and the remediation of any groundwater or solid contamination identified by pge’s consultants in 1998 at the contra costa and pittsburg generating facilities before those facilities were purchased in 1999 by our subsidiaries pursuant to our requests pge has disposed of 807 cubic yards of contaminated soil from the potrero generating facility we are not aware of soil or groundwater conditions at our contra costa pittsburg and potrero generating facilities for which we expect remediation costs to be material that are not the responsibility of other parties 

 

in 2008 we closed and then demolished the lovett generating facility in new york pursuant to an agreement with the new york state department of environmental conservation in 2009 we assessed the environmental condition of the property we do not yet know what if any remediation will be required for the lovett property 

 

we are responsible for environmental costs related to site contamination investigations and remediation requirements at four generating facilities in new jersey we recorded the estimated longterm liability for the remediation costs of 7 million at december 31 2010 

 

other as a result of their age many of our plants contain significant amounts of asbestos insulation other asbestos containing materials as well as leadbased paint we think we properly manage and dispose of such materials in compliance with state and federal rules see note 5d to our consolidated financial statements 

 

additionally cercla also known as the superfund law establishes a federal framework for dealing with the cleanup of contaminated sites many states have enacted similar state superfund statutes as well as other laws imposing obligations to investigate and clean up contamination we do not think we have any material liabilities or obligations under cercla or similar state laws these laws impose clean up and restoration liability on owners and operators of plants from or at which there has been a release or threatened release of hazardous substances together with those who have transported or arranged for the disposal of those substances 

employees 

 

at february 11 2011 we employed 3487 people which included approximately 2621 employees at our generating facilities 415 employees at our regional offices and 451 employees at our corporate headquarters in houston texas the following details the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements 

 

 

 

 

  

to mitigate and reduce the risk of disruption during labor negotiations we engage in contingency planning for operation of our generating facilities to the extent possible during an adverse collective action by one or more of our unions

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

we are subject to the following factors that could affect our future performance and results of operations also see “cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information” on page vii “business” in item 1 and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k 

 

risks related to the operation of our business 

 

the merger that created genon may not achieve its intended results and we may be unable to integrate successfully mirant’s and rri energy’s operations 

 

achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger that created genon depends on whether the businesses of rri energy and mirant can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner integration of the two companies could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees the disruption of our ongoing businesses processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures practices policies and compensation arrangements any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger we may have difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies many of our employees are in new positions following the merger and are required to comply with policies that are new to them including policies related to risk management the integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits will be realized or if realized the timing of their realization failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect our future business financial condition operating results and prospects 

 

our revenues are unpredictable because most of our generating facilities operate without longterm power sales agreements and our revenues and results of operations depend on market and competitive forces that are beyond our control 

 

we provide energy capacity ancillary and other energy services from our generating facilities into competitive power markets either on a shortterm fixed price basis or through power sales agreements our revenues from selling capacity are a significant part of our overall revenues we are not guaranteed recovery of our costs or any return on our capital investments through mandated rates the market for wholesale electric energy and energy services reflects various market conditions beyond our control including the balance of supply and demand our competitors’ marginal and longterm costs of production and the effect of market regulation the price at which we can sell our output may fluctuate on a daytoday basis and our ability to transact may be affected by the overall liquidity in the markets in which we operate these markets remain subject to regulations that limit our ability to raise prices during periods of shortage to the degree that would occur in a fully deregulated market which may limit our ability to recover costs and an adequate return 

on our investment in addition unlike most other commodities electric energy can be stored only on a very limited basis and generally must be produced at the time of use as a result the wholesale power markets are subject to substantial price fluctuations over relatively short periods of time and can be unpredictable for further discussion see “business—competitive environment” our revenues and results of operations are influenced by factors that are beyond our control including 

 

 28 

 

some of our existing generating facilities may have a limited life unless we make significant capital expenditures to increase their commercial and environmental performance which may not be justified under current market rules and conditions 

 

most of our existing generating facilities in california depend almost entirely on payments in support of system reliability the energy market as currently constituted will not justify the capital expenditures necessary to repower or reconstruct these facilities to make them commercially viable in a merchant market and to meet future environmental requirements if a commercially reasonable capacity market were to be instituted by the caiso or we could obtain a contract with a creditworthy buyer it is possible that we could justify investing the necessary capital to repower or reconstruct these facilities absent that most of our existing generating facilities in california will be commercially viable only as long as they are necessary for reliability as discussed further in note 5c to our consolidated financial statements we plan to shut down the contra costa generating facility in april 2013 and we shut down the potrero generating facility on february 28 2011 

 

our generating facilities face lower levels of profitability under current and forecasted market conditions and some of our generating facilities may not justify the capital expenditures to make them commercially viable andor to meet possible environmental requirements 

 

changes in the wholesale energy market or in our facility operations could result in impairments 

 

if our outlook for the wholesale energy market changes negatively or if our ongoing evaluation of our business results in decisions to mothball retire or dispose of facilities we could have impairment charges related to our fixed assets including the assets of rri energy that were recorded at provisional fair values in conjunction with the merger these evaluations involve significant judgments about the future actual future market prices project costs and other factors could be materially different from our current estimates furthermore increasing environmental regulatory requirements could result in facilities being removed from service or derated see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—business overview” in item 7 of this form 10k and note 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

our marsh landing development project is subject to construction risks and if we are unsuccessful in addressing those risks we may not recover our investment in the project or our return on the project may be lower than expected 

 

under its longterm ppa with pge genon marsh landing bears the risk of completing the construction of the generating facility by the required completion date under the ppa genon marsh landing has posted a letter of credit of 80 million to pge to secure its contingent obligations for delay damages or termination payments under the ppa which amounts were 16 million at december 31 2010 and escalate over the construction period genon marsh landing has also posted a letter of credit and provided a guaranty of genon energy holdings to the contractor at december 31 2010 of 26 million and 43 million respectively to secure its obligations under the epc agreement for the marsh landing project genon marsh landing has also posted surety bonds totaling 4 million to pge to secure obligations related to transmission system upgrades and interconnection services if genon marsh landing does not complete the construction of the marsh landing generating facility by the required completion date under the ppa our return on the project may be lower than expected should the facility fail to be operational by the required date under the ppa or not perform as required under the terms of the ppa pge may have the right to terminate the ppa as there is currently no wholesale capacity market in california if pge were to terminate the ppa our return on the project might be materially lower than expected 

we are exposed to the risk of fuel and fuel transportation cost increases and volatility and interruption in fuel supply because our generating facilities generally do not have longterm agreements for the supply of natural gas coal and oil and rely on other parties for transportation 

 

although we purchase fuel based on our expected fuel requirements we still face the risks of supply interruptions and fuel price volatility our cost of fuel may not reflect changes in energy and fuel prices in part because we must prepurchase inventories of coal and oil for reliability and dispatch requirements and thus the price of fuel may have been determined at an earlier date than the price of energy generated from it the price we can obtain from the sale of energy may not rise at the same rate or may not rise at all to match a rise in fuel costs this may have a material adverse effect on our financial performance the volatility of fuel prices could adversely affect our financial results and operations 

 

for our coalfired generating facilities we purchase most of our coal from a small number of suppliers under contracts with terms of varying lengths some of which extend to 2013 and one that extends to 2020 there is risk that our coal suppliers may not provide the contractual quantities on the dates specified within the agreements or the deliveries may be carried over to future periods if our coal suppliers do not perform in accordance with the agreements we may have to procure coal in the market to meet our needs or power in the market to meet our obligations in addition generally our coal suppliers do not have investment grade credit ratings nor do they post collateral with us and accordingly we may have limited ability to collect damages in the event of default by such suppliers nonperformance or default risk by our coal suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows for a discussion of our coal supplier concentration risk see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

 

for our oilfired generating facilities we typically purchase fuel from a limited number of suppliers under contracts with terms of varying lengths if our oil suppliers do not perform in accordance with the agreements we may have to procure oil in the market to meet our needs or power in the market to meet our obligations for our gasfired generating facilities any curtailments or interruptions on transporting pipelines could result in curtailment of our operations or increased fuel supply costs 

 

operation of our generating facilities involves risks that may have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations 

 

the operation of our generating facilities involves various operating risks including but not limited to 

 

 30 

 

  

a decrease in or the elimination of the revenues generated by our facilities or an increase in the costs of operating them could materially affect our cash flows and results of operations including cash flows available to us to make payments on our debt or our other obligations 

 

we are exposed to possible losses that may occur from the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contractual arrangement with us particularly in connection with our noncollateralized power hedges between genon midatlantic and financial institutions 

 

we are exposed to possible losses from the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contractual arrangement with us particularly in connection with our noncollateralized power hedges between genon midatlantic and financial institutions noncollateralized power hedges represent 42 of our net notional power position at december 31 2010 such hedges are senior unsecured obligations of genon midatlantic and the counterparties and do not require either party to post cash collateral for initial margin or for securing exposure as a result of changes in power or natural gas prices deterioration in the financial condition of our counterparties and any resulting failure to pay amounts owed to us or to perform obligations or services owed to us beyond collateral posted could have a negative effect on our business and financial condition 

 

we are subject to adverse developments in the regions in which we operate especially the pjm market 

 

at december 31 2010 our generating capacity was 50 in pjm 23 in caiso 10 in the southeast 7 in miso and 10 in nyiso and isone adverse developments in these regions especially in the pjm market where most of our revenues are derived may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition the effect of such adverse regional developments may be greater on us than on our more diversified competitors 

 

our income tax nol carry forwards could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the irc 

 

we have approximately 19 billion of federal nol carry forwards which we are able to use to offset taxable income in future years if however an “ownership change” as defined in irc section irc § 382 occurs the amount of nols that could be used in any one year following such ownership change would be substantially limited in general an “ownership change” would occur when there is a greater than 50percentage point increase in ownership of a company’s stock by stockholders each of which owns or is deemed to own under irc § 382 5 or more of such company’s stock given irc § 382’s broad definition an ownership change could be the unintended consequence of otherwise normal market trading in our stock that is outside our control moreover while we have a stockholder rights plan in place in an effort to preserve our nols the stockholder rights plan can only deter not prevent an ownership change that would result in the loss of our nols see notes 7 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

competition in wholesale power markets may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

we compete with nonutility generators regulated utilities and other energy service companies in the sale of our products and services as well as in the procurement of fuel and transmission services we compete primarily on the basis of price and service regulated utilities in the wholesale markets generally enjoy a lower cost of capital than we do and often are able to recover fixed costs through regulated retail rates including in many cases the costs of generation allowing them to build buy and upgrade generating facilities without relying exclusively on marketclearing prices to recover their investments the competitive advantages 

of such participants could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on the revenues generated by our facilities 

 

changes in technology may significantly affect our generating business by making our generating facilities less competitive 

 

we generate electricity using fossil fuels at large central facilities this method results in economies of scale and lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells microturbines windmills and photovoltaic solar cells it is possible that advances in those technologies or governmental incentives for renewable energies will reduce their costs to levels that are equal to or below that of most central station electricity production which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

the expected decommissioning andor site remediation obligations of certain of our generating facilities may negatively affect our cash flows 

 

some of our generating facilities and related properties are subject to decommissioning andor site remediation obligations that may require material expenditures furthermore laws and regulations may change to impose material additional decommissioning and remediation obligations on us in the future if we are required to make material expenditures to decommission or remediate one or more of our facilities such obligations will affect our cash flows and may adversely affect our ability to make payments on our obligations 

 

terrorist attacks future wars or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations our ability to raise capital or our future growth 

 

as a power generator we face heightened risk of an act of terrorism either a direct act against one of our generating facilities or an act against the transmission and distribution infrastructure that is used to transport our power which would cause an inability to operate as a result of systemic damage further we rely on information technology networks and systems to operate our generating facilities engage in asset management activities and process transmit and store electronic information security breaches of this information technology infrastructure including cyberattacks and cyber terrorism could lead to system disruptions generating facility shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information if such an attack or security breach were to occur our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition such an attack could affect our ability to service our indebtedness our ability to raise capital and our future growth opportunities 

 

our operations are subject to hazards customary to the power generating industry we may not have adequate insurance to cover all of these hazards 

 

power generation involves hazardous activities including acquiring transporting and unloading fuel operating large pieces of highspeed rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems in addition to natural risks such as earthquake flood storm surge lightning hurricane tornado and wind hazards such as fire explosion collapse and machinery failure are inherent risks in our operations these hazards can cause significant injury to personnel or loss of life severe damage to and destruction of property plant and equipment contamination of or damage to the environment and suspension of operations the occurrence of any one of these events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages environmental cleanup costs personal injury and fines andor penalties we maintain an amount of insurance protection that we consider adequate but we cannot assure that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject a hazard or liability for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and our financial condition 

lawsuits regulatory proceedings and tax proceedings could adversely affect our future financial results 

 

from time to time we are named as a party to or our property is the subject of lawsuits regulatory proceedings or tax proceedings we are currently involved in various proceedings which involve highly subjective matters with complex factual and legal questions their outcome is uncertain any claim that is successfully asserted against us could require significant expenditures by us and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations even if we prevail any proceedings could be costly and timeconsuming could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and could result in adverse changes in our insurance costs which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows see notes 7 18 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

if we acquire or develop additional facilities dispose of existing facilities or combine with other businesses we may incur additional costs and risks 

 

we may seek to purchase or develop additional facilities dispose of existing facilities or combine with other businesses there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful in addition these activities involve risks and challenges including identifying suitable opportunities obtaining required regulatory and other approvals integrating acquired or combined operations with our own and increasing expenses and working capital requirements furthermore in any sale we may be required to indemnify a purchaser against liabilities to finance future acquisitions we may be required to issue additional equity securities or incur additional debt obtaining such additional financing is dependent on numerous factors including general economic and capital market conditions credit availability from financial institutions the covenants in our debt agreements and our financial performance cash flow and credit ratings we cannot make any assurances that we would be able to obtain such additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

 

risks related to economic and financial market conditions 

 

the failure of the lenders under our undrawn credit facilities to perform could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations we are exposed to systemic risk of the financial markets and institutions and the risk of nonperformance of the individual lenders under our undrawn credit facilities 

 

maintaining sufficient liquidity in our business for maintenance and operating expenditures capital expenditures and collateral is crucial in order to mitigate the risk of future financial distress to us accordingly we maintain a revolving credit facility to manage our expected liquidity needs and contingencies as described in more detail in this form 10k the failure of our lenders to perform under our revolving credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the event that financial institutions are unwilling or unable to renew our existing revolving credit facility or enter into new revolving credit facilities our ability to hedge economically our assets or engage in proprietary trading could also be impaired a significant portion of the marsh landing project costs are expected to be funded through drawings under the genon marsh landing credit facility the failure of the lenders to perform under that credit facility and related interest rate swaps could have a material adverse effect on the ability to complete construction of the marsh landing facility or on the expected return on that investment 

 

as financial institutions consolidate and operate under more restrictive capital constraints and regulations there could be less liquidity in the energy and commodity markets which could have a negative effect on our ability to hedge economically and transact with creditworthy counterparties 

 

we hedge economically a substantial portion of our eastern pjm coalfired baseload generation and certain of our other generation a significant portion of our hedges are financial swap transactions between genon midatlantic and financial counterparties that are senior unsecured obligations of such parties and do not require either party to post cash collateral either for initial margin or for securing exposure as a result of changes in power or natural gas prices in recent years global financial institutions have been active participants in these energy and commodity markets as such financial institutions consolidate and operate under more restrictive capital constraints and regulations there could be less liquidity in the energy and 

commodity markets which could have a negative effect on our ability to hedge economically and transact with creditworthy counterparties 

 

the doddfrank act could materially affect our business including greater regulation of energy contracts and otc derivative financial instruments which could materially affect our ability to hedge economically our generation 

 

the doddfrank act which was enacted in july 2010 in response to the global financial crisis increases the regulation of transactions involving otc derivative financial instruments the statute provides that standardized swap transactions between dealers and large market participants will have to be cleared and traded on an exchange or electronic platform although the provisions and legislative history of the doddfrank act provide strong evidence that market participants such as the company which utilize otc derivative financial instruments to hedge commercial risks are not to be subject to these clearing and exchangetrading requirements it is uncertain what the final implementing regulations to be issued by the cftc and sec will provide the effect of the doddfrank act on our business depends in large measure on pending cftc and sec rulemaking proceedings and in particular the final definitions for the key terms “swap dealer” and “major swap participant” in the doddfrank act the cftc and sec issued a proposed rulemaking to set final definitions for the terms “swap dealer” and “major swap participant” among others entities defined as swap dealers and major swap participants will face costly requirements for clearing and posting margin as well as additional requirements for reporting and business conduct as proposed the swap dealer definition in particular is ambiguous subjective and could be broad enough to encompass some energy companies if applied to our hedging activity such regulations could materially affect our ability to hedge economically our generation by reducing liquidity in the energy and commodity markets and if we are required to clear such transactions on exchanges or meet other requirements by significantly increasing the collateral costs associated with such activities 

 

changes in commodity prices may negatively affect our financial results by increasing the cost of producing power or lowering the price at which we are able to sell our power 

 

our generating business is subject to changes in power prices and fuel and emissions costs and these commodity prices are influenced by many factors outside our control including weather seasonal variation in supply and demand market liquidity transmission and transportation inefficiencies availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources demand for energy commodities production of natural gas coal and crude oil natural disasters wars embargoes and other catastrophic events and federal state and environmental regulation and legislation in addition significant fluctuations in the price of natural gas may cause significant fluctuations in the price of electricity significant fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our financial results and financial position by increasing the cost of producing power and decreasing the amounts we receive from the sale of power 

 

our asset management activities will not fully protect us from fluctuations in commodity prices 

 

we engage in asset management activities related to sales of electricity and purchases of fuel the income and losses from these activities are recorded as operating revenues and fuel costs we may use forward contracts and other derivative financial instruments to manage market risk and exposure to volatility in prices of electricity coal natural gas emissions and oil we cannot provide assurance that these strategies will be successful in managing our price risks or that they will not result in net losses to us as a result of future volatility in electricity fuel and emissions markets actual power prices and fuel costs may differ from our expectations 

 

our asset management activities include natural gas derivative financial instruments that we use to hedge economically power prices for our baseload generation the effectiveness of these hedges is dependent upon the correlation between power and natural gas prices in the markets where we operate if those prices are not sufficiently correlated our financial results and financial position could be adversely affected see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements and “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in item 7a of this form 10k 

additionally we expect to have an open position in the market within our established guidelines resulting from our proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities to the extent open positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can affect our financial results and financial position either favorably or unfavorably as a result of these and other factors we cannot predict the outcome that risk management decisions may have on our business operating results or financial position although management devotes considerable attention to these issues their outcome is uncertain 

 

our policies and procedures cannot eliminate the risks associated with our hedging and proprietary trading activity 

 

the risk management procedures we have in place may not always be followed or may not always work as planned if any of our employees were able to violate our system of internal controls including our risk management policy and engage in unauthorized hedging and related activities it could result in significant penalties and financial losses in addition risk management tools and metrics such as value at risk gross margin at risk and stress testing are partially based on historic price movements if price movements significantly or persistently deviate from historical behavior risk limits may not fully protect us from significant losses 

 

the accounting treatment of our asset management proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities may increase the volatility of our quarterly and annual financial results 

 

we engage in asset management activities to hedge economically our exposure to market risk with respect to a electricity sales from our generating facilities b fuel used by those facilities and c emissions allowances we generally attempt to balance our fixedprice purchases and sales commitments in terms of contract volumes and the timing of performance and delivery obligations through the use of financial and physical derivative financial instruments we also use derivative financial instruments with respect to our limited proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities through which we attempt to achieve incremental returns by transacting where we have specific market expertise derivatives from our asset management proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value pursuant to the accounting guidance for derivative financial instruments other than interest rate swaps into which we entered to manage our interest rate risk associated with our genon marsh landing project financing which were designated as cash flow hedges none of our other derivatives recorded at fair value is designated as a hedge under this guidance and changes in their fair values currently are recognized in earnings as unrealized gains or losses as a result our gaap financial results—including gross margin operating income and balance sheet ratios—will at times be volatile and subject to fluctuations in value primarily because of changes in forward electricity and fuel prices see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

risks related to governmental regulation and laws 

 

our costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant and can affect our future operations and financial results 

 

we are subject to extensive and evolving environmental regulations particularly in regard to our coal and oilfired facilities failure to comply with environmental requirements could require us to shut down or reduce production at our facilities or create liabilities we incur significant costs in complying with these regulations and if we fail to comply could incur significant penalties our cost estimates for environmental compliance are based on existing regulations or our view of reasonably likely regulations and our assessment of the costs of labor and materials and the state of evolving technologies our decision to make these investments is often subject to future market conditions changes to the preceding factors new or revised environmental regulations litigation and new legislation andor regulations as well as other factors could cause our actual costs to vary outside the range of our estimates further constrain our operations increase our environmental compliance costs andor make it uneconomical to operate some of our facilities environmental laws particularly with respect to air emissions disposal of ash wastewater discharge and cooling water systems are generally becoming more stringent which may require us to make additional facility upgrades or restrict our operations 

we are required to surrender emission allowances equal to emissions of specific substances to operate our facilities surrender requirements may require purchase of allowances which may be unavailable or only available at costs that would make it uneconomical to operate our facilities 

 

federal state and regional initiatives to regulate greenhouse gas emissions could have a material impact on our financial performance and condition the actual impact will depend on a number of factors including the overall level of greenhouse gas reductions required under any such regulations the final form of the regulations or legislation and the price and availability of emission allowances if allowances are a part of the final regulatory framework see “business—environmental matters” in item 1 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—business overview” in item 7 of this form 10k and note 18 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

certain environmental laws including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and comparable state laws impose strict and in many circumstances joint and several liability for costs of remediating contamination some of our facilities have areas with known soil andor groundwater contamination releases of hazardous substances at our generating facilities or at locations where we dispose of or in the past disposed of hazardous substances and other waste could require us to spend significant sums to remediate contamination regardless of whether we caused such contamination the discovery of significant contamination at our generating facilities at disposal sites we currently use or have used or at other locations for which we may be liable or the failure or inability of parties contractually responsible to us for contamination to respond when claims or obligations regarding such contamination arise could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and condition 

 

our coalfired generating units produce certain byproducts that involve extensive handling and disposal costs and are subject to government regulation changes in these regulations or their administration by legislatures state and federal regulatory agencies or other bodies may affect the costs of handling and disposing of these byproducts 

 

as a result of the coal combustion process we produce significant quantities of ash at our coalfired generating units that must be disposed of at sites permitted to handle ash for most of our ash disposal we use our own ash management facilities which are all dry landfills to dispose of the ash however one of our landfills in maryland has reached design capacity and we expect that another one of our sites in maryland may reach full capacity in the next few years as a result we have a plan to develop new ash management facilities and also commenced construction in february 2011 of a facility that is designed to prepare our ash from certain of our maryland facilities for beneficial uses however the costs associated with purchasing new land and permitting the land to allow for ash disposal could be material and the amount of time needed to obtain permits for the land could extend beyond the expected timeline likewise the ongoing construction of a facility to prepare our ash for beneficial use may be delayed cost more than expected or not operate as expected or the ash may not be marketed and sold as expected additionally costs associated with thirdparty ash handling and disposal are material and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance and condition 

 

we also produce gypsum as a byproduct of the so 2 scrubbing process at our coalfired generating facilities which is sold to third parties for use in drywall production should our ability to sell such gypsum to third parties be restricted as a result of the lack of demand or otherwise our gypsum disposal costs could rise materially 

 

the epa has proposed two alternatives for regulating byproducts such as ash and gypsum one of these alternatives would regulate these byproducts as “special wastes” in a manner similar to the regulation of hazardous wastes if these byproducts are regulated as special wastes the cost of disposing of these byproducts would increase materially and may limit our ability to recycle them for beneficial use the epa expects to finalize this rule in late 2011 

our business is subject to complex government regulations changes in these regulations or their administration by legislatures state and federal regulatory agencies or other bodies may affect the prices at which we are able to sell the electricity we produce the costs of operating our generating facilities or our ability to operate our facilities 

 

we are subject to regulation by the ferc regarding the rates terms and conditions of wholesale sales of electric capacity energy and ancillary services and other matters including mergers and acquisitions the disposition of facilities under the ferc’s jurisdiction and the issuance of securities as well as by state agencies regarding physical aspects of our generating facilities the majority of our generation is sold at market prices under marketbased rate authority granted by the ferc if certain conditions are not met the ferc has the authority to withhold or rescind marketbased rate authority and require sales to be made based on costofservice rates a loss of our marketbased rate authority could have a materially negative impact on our generating business 

 

even when marketbased rate authority has been granted the ferc may impose various forms of market mitigation measures including price caps and operating restrictions when it determines that potential market power might exist and that the public interest requires such potential market power to be mitigated in addition to direct regulation by the ferc most of our facilities are subject to rules and terms of participation imposed and administered by various isos and rtos although these entities are themselves ultimately regulated by the ferc they can impose rules restrictions and terms of service that are quasiregulatory in nature and can have a material adverse impact on our business for example isos and rtos may impose bidding and scheduling rules both to curb the potential exercise of market power and to ensure market functions such actions may materially affect our ability to sell and the price we receive for our energy capacity and ancillary services 

 

to conduct our business we must obtain and periodically renew licenses permits and approvals for our facilities these licenses permits and approvals can be in addition to any required environmental permits no assurance can be provided that we will be able to obtain and comply with all necessary licenses permits and approvals for these facilities if we cannot comply with all applicable regulations our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

we cannot predict whether the federal or state legislatures will adopt legislation relating to the restructuring of the energy industry there are proposals in many jurisdictions that would either roll back or advance the movement toward competitive markets for the supply of electricity at both the wholesale and retail levels in addition any future legislation favoring large vertically integrated utilities and a concentration of ownership of such utilities could affect our ability to compete successfully and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected similarly any regulations or laws that favor new generation over existing generation could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

risks related to level of indebtedness 

 

our substantial indebtedness and operating lease obligations could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting or refinancing our obligations 

 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness at december 31 2010 our consolidated indebtedness was 61 billion in addition the present values of lease payments under the respective genon midatlantic and rema operating leases were approximately 927 million and 488 million respectively assuming a 10 and 94 discount rate respectively and the termination value of the respective genon midatlantic and rema operating leases was 14 billion and 752 million 

our substantial indebtedness and operating lease obligations could have important consequences for our liquidity results of operations financial position and prospects including our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy these consequences include the following 

 

  

genon and its subsidiaries that are holding companies including genon americas generation may not have access to sufficient cash to meet their obligations if their subsidiaries in particular genon midatlantic are unable to make distributions 

 

we and certain of our subsidiaries including genon americas generation are holding companies and as a result are dependent upon dividends distributions and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations in particular a substantial portion of the cash from our operations is generated by genon midatlantic the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make distributions is restricted under the terms of their debt or other agreements including the operating leases of genon midatlantic and rema under their respective operating leases genon midatlantic and rema are not permitted to make any distributions and other restricted payments unless a they satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters b they are projected to satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for each of the two following periods of four fiscal quarters commencing with the fiscal quarter in which such payment is proposed to be made and c no significant lease default or event of default has occurred and is continuing in the event of a default under the respective operating leases or if the respective restricted payment tests are not satisfied genon midatlantic and rema would not be able to distribute cash at december 31 2010 genon midatlantic and rema satisfied the respective restricted payments tests 

 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and to post required amounts of cash collateral necessary to hedge economically market risk 

 

our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt depends on our future operating performance if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to allow us to make scheduled payments on our debt we may have to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital restructure or refinance there can be no assurance that the terms of our debt will allow these alternative measures that the financial markets will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such measures would satisfy our scheduled debt service obligations if we do not comply with the payment and other material covenants under our debt agreements we could be required to repay our debt immediately and in the case of our revolving credit facilities the commitment to lend us money could terminate 

we seek to manage the risks associated with the volatility in the price at which we sell power produced by our generating facilities and in the prices of fuel emissions allowances and other inputs required to produce such power by entering into hedging transactions these asset management activities may require us to post collateral either in the form of cash or letters of credit at december 31 2010 we had approximately 265 million of posted cash collateral and 267 million of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility primarily to support our asset management activities trading activities rent reserve requirements and other commercial arrangements see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our posted cash collateral and letters of credit although we seek to structure transactions in a way that reduces our potential liquidity needs for collateral we may be unable to execute our hedging strategy successfully if we are unable to post the amount of collateral required to enter into and support hedging contracts 

 

we are an active participant in energy exchange and clearing markets these markets require a percontract initial margin to be posted regardless of the credit quality of the participant the initial margins are determined by the exchanges through the use of proprietary models that rely on a variety of inputs and factors including market conditions we have limited notice of any changes to the margin rates consequently we are exposed to changes in the per unit margin rates required by the exchanges and could be required to post additional collateral on short notice 

 

the terms of our credit facilities restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or take certain actions 

 

our credit facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to 

 

  

in addition the restrictive covenants in our credit facilities require us to maintain a ratio of consolidated secured debt net of up to 500 million in cash to ebitda of not more than 350 to 100 which will be tested at the end of each fiscal quarter and in the case of ebitda will be calculated on a rolling four fiscal quarter basis ending on the last day of such fiscal quarter our ability to meet that financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control our failure to comply with the covenants in our credit facilities could result in an event of default under our credit facilities and any other debt to which a crossdefault or crossacceleration provision applies

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

this section is intended to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements the changes in those financial statements from year to year and the primary factors contributing to those changes the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes accompanying those financial statements 

 

merger of mirant and rri energy 

 

on december 3 2010 mirant and rri energy completed their merger mirant merged with a whollyowned subsidiary of rri energy with mirant surviving the merger as a whollyowned subsidiary of rri energy in connection with the allstock taxfree merger rri energy changed its name to genon energy inc mirant stockholders received a fixed ratio of 2835 shares of genon common stock for each share of mirant common stock and mirant changed its name to genon energy holdings 

 

although rri energy was the legal acquirer the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition and mirant was deemed to have acquired rri energy for accounting purposes as a consequence of the reverse acquisition accounting treatment the historical financial statements presented for periods prior to the merger date are the historical statements of mirant except for stockholders’ equity which has been retroactively adjusted for the equivalent number of shares of the legal acquirer the operations of the former rri energy businesses have been included in the financial statements from the date of the merger for a discussion of our strategy see item 1 “business—strategy” in this form 10k 

 

our business 

 

with approximately 24200 mw of electric generating capacity we operate across various fuel natural gas coal and oil and technology types operating characteristics and regional power markets at december 31 2010 our generating capacity was 50 in pjm 23 in caiso 10 in the southeast 7 in miso and 10 in nyiso and isone 

 

we provide energy capacity ancillary and other energy services to wholesale customers in competitive energy markets in the united states including isos and rtos power aggregators retail providers electriccooperative utilities other power generating companies and load serving entities our commercial operations consist primarily of dispatching electricity hedging the generation and sale of electricity procuring and managing fuel and providing logistical support for the operation of our facilities eg by procuring transportation for coal and natural gas as well as our proprietary trading operations 

 

we typically sell the electricity we produce into the wholesale market at prices in effect at the time we produce it spot price we use dispatch models to assist in making daily bidding decisions regarding the quantity and price of the power we offer to generate from our facilities and sell into the markets we bid the energy from our generating facilities into the hourahead or dayahead energy market and sell ancillary services through the iso and rto markets we work with the isos and rtos in real time to ensure that our generating facilities are dispatched economically to meet the reliability needs of the market 

 

spot prices for electricity are volatile as are prices for fuel and emissions allowances in order to reduce the risk of price volatility and achieve more predictable financial results we have historically entered into economic hedges—forward sales of electricity and forward purchases of fuel and emissions allowances to permit us to produce and sell the electricity—to manage the risks associated with such volatility in addition given the high correlation between natural gas prices and electricity prices in the markets in which we operate we have entered into forward sales of natural gas to hedge economically exposure to changes in the price of electricity we procure hedges in otc transactions or on exchanges where electricity fuel and emissions allowances are broadly traded or through specific transactions with buyers and sellers using futures forwards swaps and options 

 

we sell capacity either bilaterally or through periodic auctions in each iso and rto market in which we participate these capacity sales provide an important source of predictable revenues for us over the contracted 

period at january 31 2011 total projected contracted capacity and ppa revenues for which prices have been set for 2011 through 2014 are 31 billion 

 

in addition to the activities described above we buy and sell some electricity fuel and emissions allowances sometimes through financial derivatives as part of our proprietary trading fuel oil management and natural gas transportation and storage activities we engage in proprietary trading to gain information about the markets in which we operate to support our asset management and to take advantage of selected opportunities that we identify we enter into fuel oil management activities to hedge economically the fair value of our physical fuel oil inventories optimize the approximately three million barrels of storage capacity that we own or lease as well as attempt to profit from market opportunities related to timing andor differences in the pricing of various products we engage in natural gas transportation and storage activities to optimize our physical natural gas and storage positions and manage the physical gas requirements for a portion of our assets proprietary trading fuel oil management and natural gas transportation and storage activities together will typically comprise less than 5 of our realized gross margin all of our commercial activities are governed by a comprehensive risk management policy which includes limits on the size of volumetric positions and var for our proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities for 2010 the combined average daily var for proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities was 2 million 

 

hedging activities 

 

we hedge economically a substantial portion of our eastern pjm coalfired baseload generation and certain of our other generation we generally do not hedge our intermediate and peaking units for tenors greater than 12 months we hedge economically using products which we expect to be effective to mitigate the price risk of our generation however as a result of market liquidity limitations our hedges often are not an exact match for the generation being hedged and we then have some risks resulting from price differentials for different delivery points and for implied differences in heat rates when we hedge economically power using natural gas currently a significant portion of our hedges are financial swap transactions between genon midatlantic and financial counterparties that are senior unsecured obligations of such parties and do not require either party to post cash collateral either for initial margin or for securing exposure as a result of changes in power or natural gas prices at january 31 2011 our aggregate hedge levels based on expected generation for each year were as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

see item 1a “risk factors—risks related to economic and financial market conditions” for a discussion of 

 

  

capital expenditures and capital resources 

 

for 2010 we invested 298 million for capital expenditures excluding capitalized interest of which 114 million related to compliance with the maryland healthy air act at december 31 2010 we have invested 1519 billion of the 1674 billion that was budgeted for capital expenditures related to compliance with the maryland healthy air act as the final part of our compliance with the maryland healthy air act 

we placed four scrubbers in service at our maryland facilities in the fourth quarter of 2009 provisions in the construction contracts for the scrubbers provide for certain payments to be made after final completion of the project the current budget of 1674 billion continues to represent our best estimate of the total capital expenditures for compliance with the maryland healthy air act see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of scrubber contract litigation 

 

for 2010 our capitalized interest was 6 million compared to 72 million for 2009 the decrease in capitalized interest from 2009 is a result of placing our scrubbers in service at our maryland facilities in the fourth quarter of 2009 

 

the following table details the expected timing of payments for our estimated capital expenditures excluding capitalized interest not related to the marsh landing generating facility for 2011 and 2012 

 

 

 

we expect that available cash and future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund these capital expenditures however we plan to fund a substantial portion of the capital expenditures for the marsh landing generating facility with approximately 500 million of project financing debt into which we entered on october 8 2010 see “california development activities” below for additional information on the marsh landing generating facility other environmental capital expenditures set forth above could significantly increase subject to the content and timing of final rules and future market conditions 

 

environmental matters 

 

we make decisions to invest capital for environmental controls based on relatively certain regulations and the expected economic returns on the capital as discussed in part 1 of this form 10k under “business—regulatory environment—environmental regulation” the effect on our business of pending epa regulations to replace the cair and whether we elect to install additional controls are uncertain and depend on the content and timing of the regulations the expected effect of the regulations on wholesale power prices and allowance prices as well as the cost of controls profitability of our generating facilities market conditions at the time and the likelihood of co 2 regulation the epa has stated that it expects to finalize the regulations to replace the cair in 2011 we may choose to retire certain of our units rather than install additional controls 

 

the costs associated with more stringent environmental air quality requirements may result in coalfired generating facilities including some of ours being retired although conditions may change under current and forecasted market conditions installations of additional scrubbers would not be economic at most of our unscrubbed coalfired facilities any such retirements could contribute to improving supply and demand fundamentals for the remaining fleet any resulting increased demand for gas could increase the spread between gas and coal prices which would also benefit the remaining coalfired generating facilities 

 

furthermore federal statespecific or regional regulatory initiatives to stimulate co 2 emission reductions in our industry are being considered the effect on our business of these matters is uncertain and depends on the form and content of resulting regulations if any including their effect on a wholesale electricity and emissions allowance prices and b other existing regulations such as the rggi 

 

if co 2 regulation becomes more stringent we expect that the demand for gas andor renewable sources of electricity will increase over time although we expect that market prices for electricity would increase following such regulation and would allow us to recover a portion of the resulting costs we cannot predict 

with any certainty the actual increases in costs such regulation could impose upon us or our ability to recover such cost increases through higher market rates for electricity it is possible that congress will take action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions within the next several years the form and timing of any final legislation will be influenced by political and economic factors and are uncertain at this time implementation of a co 2 capandtrade program in addition to other emission control requirements could increase the likelihood of coalfired generating facility retirements 

 

given the uncertainty related to these environmental matters we cannot predict their actual outcome or ultimate effect on our business and such matters could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows see “business—regulatory environment—environmental regulation” and “risk factors—risks related to governmental regulation and laws” in items 1 and 1a respectively of this form 10k and note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

commodity prices 

 

the prices for power and natural gas remain low compared to several years ago the energy gross margin from our generating facilities is negatively affected by these price levels for that portion of the volumes of generation that we have hedged we are generally economically neutral to subsequent changes in commodity prices because our realized gross margin will reflect the contractual prices of our power and fuel contracts we continue to add economic hedges including to maintain projected levels of cash flows from operations for future periods to help support continued compliance with the covenants in our debt and lease agreements 

 

california development activities 

 

genon marsh landing 

 

on september 2 2009 genon marsh landing entered into a tenyear ppa with pge for 760 mw of natural gasfired peaking generation to be constructed adjacent to our contra costa generating facility near antioch california 

 

during the tenyear term of the ppa genon marsh landing will receive fixed monthly capacity payments and variable operating payments the contract provides pge with the entire output of the 760 mw generating facility which is expected to be capable of producing 719 mw during peak july conditions 

 

on may 6 2010 genon marsh landing entered into an epc agreement with kiewit power constructors co kiewit for the construction of the marsh landing generating facility under the epc agreement kiewit is to design and construct the marsh landing generating facility on a turnkey basis including all engineering procurement construction commissioning training startup and testing the lump sum cost of the epc agreement is 499 million including the 212 million total cost under the siemens turbine generator supply and services agreement which was assigned to kiewit in connection with the execution of the epc agreement plus the reimbursement of california sales and use taxes see “debt obligations offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations” in “liquidity and capital resources” for additional information on the epc agreement with kiewit 

 

on october 8 2010 genon marsh landing entered into a credit agreement for up to 650 million of commitments to finance the marsh landing generating facility see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

genon marsh landing has received all permits necessary to begin construction and on october 8 2010 directed kiewit to commence engineering and procurement for the marsh landing generating facility construction of the marsh landing generating facility is expected to be completed by mid2013 

 

contra costa toll extension 

 

on september 2 2009 genon delta entered into an agreement with pge for the 674 mw of contra costa units 6 and 7 for the period from november 2011 through april 2013 at the end of the agreement and 

subject to any necessary regulatory approval genon delta has agreed to retire contra costa units 6 and 7 which began operations in 1964 in furtherance of state and federal policies to retire aging power plants that utilize oncethrough cooling technology 

 

pittsburg toll extension 

 

on october 28 2010 genon delta entered into an agreement with pge for 1159 mw of capacity from pittsburg units 5 6 and 7 for three years commencing january 1 2011 with options for pge to extend the agreement for each of 2014 and 2015 under the agreement genon delta will receive monthly capacity payments with bonuses andor penalties based on heat rate and availability 

 

potrero settlement 

 

on august 13 2009 genon potrero entered into a settlement agreement potrero settlement with the city and county of san francisco among other things the potrero settlement obligates genon potrero to close permanently each of the remaining units of the potrero generating facility at the end of the year in which the caiso determines that such unit is no longer needed to maintain the reliable operation of the electricity system in december 2010 the caiso provided genon potrero with the requisite notice of termination of the rmr agreement on january 19 2011 at the request of genon potrero the ferc approved changes to genon potrero’s rmr agreement to allow the caiso to terminate the rmr agreement effective february 28 2011 on february 28 2011 the potrero facility was shut down see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the potrero settlement 

 

ibew local 1900 collective bargaining agreement 

 

during the second quarter of 2010 we entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with our employees represented by ibew local 1900 located in maryland and virginia the previous collective bargaining agreement expired on june 1 2010 the new agreement has a fiveyear term expiring on june 1 2015 as part of the new agreement we are required to provide additional retirement contributions through the defined contribution plan increases in pay and other benefits in addition the agreement provides for a change to the postretirement healthcare benefit plan covering ibew local 1900 union employees to eliminate employerprovided healthcare subsidies through a gradual phaseout we recorded the effects of the plan curtailment during the second quarter of 2010 and recognized a reduction in other postretirement liabilities of 48 million and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 11 million on the consolidated balance sheet and a gain of 37 million reflected as a reduction in operations and maintenance expense on the consolidated statement of operations in addition we recognized an increase of 3 million in our pension liability and in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a result of planned salary increases under the new collective bargaining agreement see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the postretirement healthcare benefit curtailment 

 

results of operations 

 

upon completion of the merger mirant stockholders had a majority of the voting interest in the combined company although rri energy issued shares of rri energy common stock to mirant stockholders to effect the merger the merger is accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting under the acquisition method of accounting mirant is treated as the accounting acquirer and rri energy is treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes as such the consolidated financial statements and results below of genon include the results of mirant from january 1 2008 through december 2 2010 and include the results of the combined entities for the period from december 3 2010 through december 31 2010 the consolidated financial statements presented herein for periods ended prior to the closing of the merger and any other financial information presented herein with respect to such premerger dates unless otherwise specified are the consolidated financial statements and other financial information of mirant 

nongaap performance measures the following discussion includes the nongaap financial measures realized gross margin and unrealized gross margin to reflect how we manage our business in our discussion of the results of our reportable segments we include the components of realized gross margin which are energy contracted and capacity and realized value of hedges management generally evaluates our operating results excluding the impact of unrealized gains and losses when viewed with our gaap financial results these nongaap financial measures may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business realized gross margin represents our gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization less unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments conversely unrealized gross margin represents our unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments none of our derivative financial instruments recorded at fair value is designated as a hedge other than our interest rate swaps and changes in their fair values are recognized currently in income as unrealized gains or losses as a result our financial results are at times volatile and subject to fluctuations in value primarily because of changes in forward electricity and fuel prices realized gross margin together with its components energy contracted and capacity and realized value of hedges provide a measure of performance that eliminates the volatility reflected in unrealized gross margin which is created by significant shifts in market values between periods we also disclose the nongaap financial measures adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda as consolidated performance measures which exclude unrealized gross margin as mentioned above management generally evaluates our operating results excluding the effect of unrealized gains and losses adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda also exclude items related to the merger and the former mirant bankruptcy as well as impairment charges and net lower of cost or market adjustments to our commodity inventories and certain other items we adjust for the subsequent benefit created by commodity inventory utilized in operations that were subject to prior period lower of cost or market adjustments we exclude or adjust for these items to provide a more meaningful representation of our ongoing results of operations however these nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled nongaap financial measures used by other companies 

 

we use these nongaap financial measures in communications with investors analysts rating agencies banks and other parties adjusted ebitda is a key performance metric in our employee shortterm incentive structure for annual bonuses we think these nongaap financial measures provide meaningful representations of our consolidated operating performance and are useful to us and others in facilitating the analysis of our results of operations from one period to another we view adjusted ebitda as providing a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies we encourage our investors to review our consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure 

2010 compared to 2009 

 

consolidated financial performance 

 

we reported net loss of 50 million and net income of 494 million for 2010 and 2009 respectively the change in net incomeloss is detailed as follows 

 

 

 

realized gross margin for 2010 our realized gross margin decrease of 203 million was principally a result of the following 

 

  

unrealized gross margin our unrealized gross margin for both periods reflects the following 

 

 51 

  

  

operating expenses our operating expenses increase of 674 million was primarily a result of the following 

 

  

 52 

 

  

  

gain on bargain purchase we reported a gain on bargain purchase of 518 million during 2010 because the fair value of the net assets acquired in the merger exceeds the purchase price the merger is being accounted for as a bargain purchase in accordance with acquisition accounting guidance the estimated gain on the bargain purchase is primarily a result of differences between the longterm fundamental value of the generating facilities and the effect of the nearterm view of the equity markets on the price of mirant common stock at the close of the merger specifically as a result of the following 

 

  

the merger is accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations accordingly we conducted an assessment of the net assets acquired and recognized provisional amounts for identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated acquisition date fair values while transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition are expensed as incurred any changes to the fair value assessments will affect the gain on bargain purchase and material changes could require the financial statements to be retroactively amended see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the merger 

 

interest expense net interest expense net increase of 118 million was primarily a result of the following

gross margin overview 

 

the following tables detail realized and unrealized gross margin for 2010 and 2009 by operating segments 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

energy represents gross margin from the generation of electricity fuel sales and purchases at market prices fuel handling steam sales and our proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities and natural gas transportation and storage activities 

 

contracted and capacity represents gross margin received from capacity sold in iso and rto administered capacity markets through rmr contracts for 2010 and 2009 through ppas and tolling agreements and from ancillary services 

 

realized value of hedges represents the actual margin upon the settlement of our power and fuel hedging contracts and the difference between market prices and contract costs for fuel power hedging contracts include sales of both power and natural gas used to hedge power prices as well as hedges to capture the incremental value related to the geographic location of our physical assets 

 

unrealized gross margin represents the net unrealized gain or loss on our derivative contracts including the reversal of unrealized gains and losses recognized in prior periods and changes in value for future periods

the following table summarizes net capacity factor by segment for 2010 and 2009 

 

 

 

the following table summarizes power generation volumes by segment for 2010 and 2009 

 

 

 

 

  

the total increase in power generation volumes for 2010 as compared to 2009 is primarily the result of the following 

 

eastern pjm an increase in our generation volumes primarily as a result of higher power prices resulting from an increase in demand because of higher average temperatures and a decrease in outages in 2010 compared to 2009 

 

western pjmmiso the western pjmmiso segment was formed as a result of the merger 

california the decrease in our intermediate generation volumes is primarily the result of the transbay cable becoming operational during the fourth quarter of 2010 which reduced the demand for our natural gasfired potrero generating unit see note 19 for further information on the potrero settlement 

 

other operations a decrease in our other operations intermediate generation as a result of transmission upgrades in 2009 which reduced the demand for the oilfired intermediate units at our canal generating facility and unplanned outages in 2010 partially offset by increases in generation volumes in our baseload and peaking units 

 

eastern pjm 

 

our eastern pjm segment includes eight generating facilities with total net generating capacity of 6336 mw at december 31 2010 and four generating facilities with total net generating capacity of 5204 mw at december 31 2009 

 

the following table summarizes the results of operations of our eastern pjm segment

2010 and 2009 in addition we have some units in southern california that we operate under tolling agreements with other customers therefore our gross margin generally is not affected by changes in power generation volumes from these facilities 

 

for those units that are not under tolling or rmr agreements gross margin is affected by changes in power generation volumes as well as resource adequacy capacity sales 

 

operating expenses 

 

the decrease of 5 million in operating expenses was principally a result of the following 

 

  

energy marketing 

 

our energy marketing segment consists of proprietary trading fuel oil management and natural gas transportation and storage activities 

 

the following table summarizes the results of operations of our energy marketing segment 

 

 

 

gross margin 

 

the decrease of 133 million in realized gross margin was principally a result of a 76 million decrease from proprietary trading activities and a 57 million decrease from our fuel oil management activities the decrease in the contribution from proprietary trading was primarily a result of a decrease in the realized value associated with power positions in 2010 as compared to 2009 the decrease in the contribution from fuel oil management was a result of lower gross margin on positions used to hedge economically the fair value of our physical fuel oil inventory 

our unrealized gross margin for both periods reflects the following 

 

  

other operations 

 

our other operations segment consists of nine generating facilities with total net generating capacity of 5055 mw at december 31 2010 and four generating facilities with total net generating capacity of 2535 mw at december 31 2009 other operations also includes unallocated overhead expenses and other activity that cannot be specifically identified to another segment

the following table summarizes net capacity factor by segment for 2009 and 2008 

 

 

 

the following table summarizes power generation volumes by segment for 2009 and 2008 

 

 

 

the total decrease in power generation volumes for 2009 as compared to 2008 is primarily the result of the following 

 

eastern pjm a decrease in our eastern pjm baseload generation as a result of a decrease in demand in 2009 compared to 2008 and a decrease in natural gas prices which at times made it uneconomic for certain of our coalfired units to generate 

 

california all of our california generating facilities operate under tolling agreements or are subject to rmr arrangements our natural gasfired units in service at contra costa and pittsburg operate under tolling agreements with pge for 100 of the capacity from these units and our potrero units were subject to rmr arrangements in 2009 and 2008 therefore changes in power generation volumes from those generating 

facilities which can be caused by weather planned outages or other factors generally did not affect our gross margin 

 

other operations a decrease in our other operations intermediate generation as a result of transmission upgrades in 2009 which reduced the demand for certain of our intermediate units partially offset by an increase in our other operations baseload generation as a result of an increase in market spark spreads

other significant consolidated statements of operations comparison 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

provision for income taxes increased 10 million which includes an increase in our federal alternative minimum tax of 7 million and an increase in our state income taxes of 3 million primarily as a result of a change in 2008 in the state of california’s tax law that suspended the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards for the 2008 and 2009 tax years

for 2008 income from discontinued operations was 50 million and included insurance recoveries related to the sual generating facility outages that occurred prior to the 2007 sale of the philippine business and final working capital adjustments related to the 2007 sale of the caribbean business 

 

financial condition 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

management thinks that our liquidity position and cash flows from operations will be adequate to fund operating maintenance and capital expenditures to fund debt service and to meet other liquidity requirements management regularly monitors our ability to fund our operating financing and investing activities see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our debt 

debt financing transactions related to the merger 

 

debt issuances 

 

senior secured term loan facility and revolving credit facility 

 

on september 20 2010 we entered into a credit agreement which provides for 

 

  

we refer to the new term loan facility and the new revolving facility collectively as the “genon credit facilities” the term loan facility was funded at the close of the merger on december 3 2010 although 275 million of outstanding letters of credit were transferred from premerger credit facilities we did not make any borrowings under the revolving credit facility at closing 

 

availability of borrowings under the genon revolving credit facility is reduced by any outstanding letters of credit at december 31 2010 outstanding letters of credit were 267 million and availability of borrowings under the revolving credit facility was 521 million 

 

the genon credit facilities and the subsidiary guarantees thereof are senior secured obligations of genon and certain of its existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries excluding genon americas generation provided however that certain of genon americas generation’s subsidiaries other than genon midatlantic and genon energy management and their subsidiaries guarantee the genon credit facilities to the extent permitted under the indenture for the senior notes of genon americas generation genon americas became a coborrower under the genon credit facilities upon the closing of the merger 

 

senior unsecured notes due 2018 and 2020 

 

on october 4 2010 genon escrow issued two series of senior unsecured notes 

 

  

upon issuance the proceeds of the notes which were issued at a discount together with additional funds were deposited into a segregated escrow account pending completion of the merger upon completion of the merger genon escrow merged with and into genon which assumed all of genon escrow’s obligations under the notes and the related indenture and the funds held in escrow were released to genon 

 

discharge defeasance redemption and repayment of debt 

 

the proceeds from the mergerrelated debt issuances described above were used to fund 

 

 73 

 

sources of funds and capital structure 

 

maintaining sufficient liquidity in our business is crucial in order to mitigate the risk of future financial distress to us accordingly we plan on a prospective basis for the expected liquidity requirements of our business considering the factors listed below 

 

  

the principal sources of our liquidity are expected to be a existing cash on hand and expected cash flows from the operations of our subsidiaries b letters of credit issued or borrowings made under the genon senior secured revolving credit facility and c letters of credit issued or borrowings made under the genon marsh landing project financing 

 

our operating cash flows may be affected by among other things a demand for electricity b the difference between the cost of fuel used to generate electricity and the market value of the electricity generated c commodity prices including prices for electricity emissions allowances natural gas coal and oil d operations and maintenance expenses in the ordinary course e planned and unplanned outages f terms with trade creditors and g cash requirements for capital expenditures relating to certain facilities including those necessary to comply with environmental regulations 

 

the table below sets forth total cash cash equivalents and availability under credit facilities of genon and its subsidiaries at december 31 2010 in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

we consider all shortterm investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents at december 31 2010 except for amounts held in bank accounts to cover upcoming payables all of our cash and cash equivalents were invested in aaarated united states treasury money market funds 

we and certain of our subsidiaries including genon americas generation are holding companies the chart below is a summary representation of our capital structure and is not a complete corporate organizational chart 

 

 

 

 75 

 

  

except for existing cash on hand genon and genon americas generation are holding companies that are dependent on the distributions and dividends of their subsidiaries for liquidity a substantial portion of cash from our operations is generated by genon midatlantic 

 

the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make distributions is restricted under the terms of their debt or other agreements including the operating leases of genon midatlantic and rema under their respective operating leases genon midatlantic and rema are not permitted to make any distributions and other restricted payments unless a they satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters b they are projected to satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for each of the two following periods of four fiscal quarters commencing with the fiscal quarter in which such payment is proposed to be made and c no significant lease default or event of default has occurred and is continuing in the event of a default under the respective operating leases or if the respective restricted payment tests are not satisfied genon midatlantic and rema would not be able to distribute cash at december 31 2010 genon midatlantic and rema satisfied the respective restricted payments tests 

 

pursuant to the terms of their respective lease and debt documents genon midatlantic rema and genon marsh landing are restricted from among other actions a encumbering assets b entering into business combinations or divesting assets c incurring additional debt d entering into transactions with affiliates on other than an arm’s length basis or e materially changing their business therefore at december 31 2010 all of genon midatlantic’s net assets excluding cash and all of rema’s net assets excluding cash were deemed restricted for purposes of rule 408e3ii of regulation sx the amounts of the deemed restricted net assets were as follows 

 

 

 

the ability of genon americas generation to pay its obligations is dependent on the receipt of dividends from genon north america capital contributions or intercompany loans from genon and its ability to refinance all or a portion of those obligations as they become due although we continue to evaluate our refinancing options we expect to maintain adequate liquidity to retire the 535 million of genon americas generation senior notes that come due in may 2011 

 

genon marsh landing credit facility 

 

on october 8 2010 genon marsh landing entered into a credit agreement for up to approximately 650 million of commitments to provide construction and permanent financing for the marsh landing generating facility the credit facility consists of a 155 million tranche a senior secured term loan facility a 345 million tranche b senior secured term loan facility a 50 million senior secured letter of credit facility to support genon marsh landing’s debt service reserve requirements and a 100 million senior secured letter of credit facility to support genon marsh landing’s collateral requirements under its ppa with pge the term loans are expected to be drawn during the construction of the project upon the satisfaction of the conditions precedent thereto including the receipt by genon marsh landing of base equity contributions of 147 million prior to the commercial operation date of the project the collateral requirements under the ppa 

and construction contracts are being met by a 165 million cash collateralized letter of credit facility entered into by genon energy holdings on behalf of genon marsh landing on september 27 2010 at or near the commercial operation date of the project those collateral requirements will terminate at december 31 2010 genon marsh landing had not drawn on its credit facility 

 

the term loans are to be fully amortized by their maturity dates the tranche a term loan matures on december 31 2017 and the tranche b term loan matures on the date that is the earlier of the last day of the first fiscal quarter following the tenth anniversary of the conversion of the credit facility from a construction facility to a permanent facility upon commercial operation of the marsh landing project and december 31 2023 the expiry date of the letters of credit is december 31 2017 interest on the tranche a term loans will be based on a base rate or a libor rate plus an initial applicable margin of 15 for base rate loans and 25 for libor loans with such margin increasing 025 every three years interest on the tranche b term loans will be based on a base rate or a libor rate plus an initial applicable margin of 175 for base rate loans and 275 for libor loans with such margin increasing 025 every three years fees on lenders’ exposure under the letters of credit accrue at a rate equal to the applicable margin payable on the tranche a term loans that are based on the libor rate an undrawn commitment fee applies at a rate of 075 per annum 

 

in connection with the credit agreement genon marsh landing entered into interest rate swaps to mitigate the interest rate risks with respect to the term loan genon energy holdings provided limited guarantees in respect of the interest rate swaps the effective interest rate that genon marsh landing will pay for the term loan from the commercial operations date is 591 plus the stepup in margin over time the interest rate swaps will be accounted for as cash flow hedges with changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income with the exception of any ineffectiveness which will be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations genon expects the interest rate swaps to remain highly effective in mitigating the interest rate risk 

 

uses of funds 

 

our requirements for liquidity and capital resources other than for the daytoday operation of our generating facilities are significantly influenced by the following items a capital expenditures b debt service c payments under the genon midatlantic and rema operating leases d collateral required for our asset management and proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities and e the development and construction of new generating facilities in particular the genon marsh landing generating facility 

 

capital expenditures our capital expenditures excluding capitalized interest during 2010 were 298 million our estimated capital expenditures excluding capitalized interest not related to the marsh landing generating facility for 2011 and 2012 are 592 million and 432 million respectively see item 1 “business” for further discussion of our capital expenditures

critical accounting estimates 

 

the accounting policies described below are considered critical to obtaining an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application requires significant estimates and judgments by management in preparing our consolidated financial statements management’s estimates and judgments are inherently uncertain and may differ significantly from actual results achieved management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if the following conditions apply 

 

  

we have discussed the selection and application of these accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and our independent registered public accounting firm it is management’s view that the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate however actual results can differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions the sections below contain information about our most critical accounting estimates as well as the effects of hypothetical changes in the material assumptions used to develop the estimates 

 

revenue recognition and accounting for energy trading and marketing activities 

 

nature of estimates required accounting standards require an accrual model to be used to account for our revenues from the sale of energy capacity and ancillary services we recognize revenue when it has been earned and collection is probable as a result of electricity delivered or capacity available to customers pursuant to contractual commitments that specify volume price and delivery requirements sales of energy primarily are based on economic dispatch or they may be ’asordered’ by an iso or rto based on member participation agreements but without an underlying contractual commitment iso and rto revenues and 

revenues for sales of energy based on economic dispatch are recorded on the basis of mwh delivered at the relevant dayahead or realtime prices sales that have been delivered but not billed by period end are estimated the accrual model is also used to account for our revenues from the sales of natural gas these sales are sold at marketbased prices through third party contracts sales that have been delivered but not billed by period end are estimated 

 

accounting standards require a fair value model to be used to measure fair value on a recurring basis for derivative energy contracts that are used to manage our exposure to commodity price risk or that are used in our proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities we use a variety of derivative financial instruments such as futures forwards swaps and option contracts in the management of our business such derivative financial instruments have varying terms and durations or tenors which range from a few days to a number of years depending on the instrument 

 

derivative financial instruments are recorded in our consolidated financial statements at fair value as either derivative contract assets or derivative contract liabilities with changes in fair value recognized currently in income unless we have elected to apply cash flow hedging or they qualify for a scope exception pursuant to the accounting guidance management considers fair value techniques and valuation adjustments related to credit and liquidity to be critical accounting estimates these estimates are considered significant because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period and are dependent on many subjective factors transactions that are not accounted for using the fair value model under the accounting guidance for derivative financial instruments are either not derivatives or qualify for the scope exception and are accounted for under accrual accounting we recognize immediately in income inception gains and losses for transactions at other than the bid price or ask price 

 

key assumptions and approach used in determining fair value we generally use a market approach and incorporate assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumptions about risk andor the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation techniques the fair value measurement inputs we use vary from readily observable prices for exchangetraded and overthecounter instruments level 1 or level 2 to price curves that cannot be validated through external pricing sources level 3 note 4 to our consolidated financial statements explains the fair value hierarchy for most delivery locations and tenors where we have positions we receive multiple independent broker price quotes in accordance with the exit price objective under the fair value measurements accounting guidance the fair value of our derivative contract assets and liabilities is determined based on the net underlying position of the recorded derivative contract assets and liabilities using bid prices for our assets and ask prices for liabilities if no active market exists we estimate the fair value of certain derivative financial instruments using price extrapolation interpolation and other quantitative methods we have not identified any distressed market conditions that would alter our valuation techniques at december 31 2010 fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment our techniques for fair value estimation include assumptions for market prices correlation and volatility the degree of estimation increases for longer duration contracts contracts with multiple pricing features option contracts and offhub delivery points our assets and liabilities classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy represent approximately 3 of our total assets and 9 of our total liabilities measured at fair value at december 31 2010 

 

the fair value of derivative contract assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets is also affected by our assumptions as to time value credit risk and nonperformance risk the nominal value of the contracts is discounted using a forward interest rate curve based on libor in addition the fair value of our derivative contract assets is reduced to reflect the estimated default risk of counterparties on their contractual obligations to us the default risk of our counterparties for a significant portion of our overall net position is measured based on published spreads on credit default swaps the fair value of our derivative contract liabilities is reduced to reflect our estimated risk of default on our contractual obligations to counterparties and is measured based on published default rates of our debt the credit risk reflected in the fair value of our derivative contract assets and the nonperformance risk reflected in the fair value of our derivative contract liabilities are calculated with consideration of our master netting agreements with counterparties and our exposure is reduced by cash collateral posted to us against these obligations 

effect if different assumptions used the amounts recorded as revenue or cost of fuel electricity and other products change as estimates are revised to reflect actual results and changes in market conditions or other factors many of which are beyond our control because we use derivative financial instruments and have not elected cash flow or fair value hedge accounting for the majority of our derivative financial instruments certain components of our financial statements including gross margin operating income and balance sheet ratios are at times volatile and subject to fluctuations in value primarily as a result of changes in forward energy and fuel prices significant negative changes in fair value could require us to post additional collateral either in the form of cash or letters of credit because the fair value measurements of our material assets and liabilities are based on observable market information there is not a significant range of values around the fair value estimate for our derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value using quantitative pricing models a significant change in estimate could affect our results of operations and cash flows at the time contracts are ultimately settled the estimated fair value of our derivative contract assets and liabilities was a net asset of 720 million at december 31 2010 a 10 change in electricity and fuel prices would result in approximately a 203 million change in the fair value of our net asset at december 31 2010 see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further sensitivities in our assumptions used to calculate fair value see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on derivative financial instruments related to energy trading and marketing activities 

 

income taxes and deferred tax asset valuation allowance 

 

nature of estimates required we currently record a tax provision for state and federal income taxes including any alternative minimum tax as applicable we also recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the balance sheet carrying amounts and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recoverable based on expected future taxable income to the extent that we determine it is morelikelythannot greater than a 50 probability that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our deferred tax assets and the application of a valuation allowance to our nols 

 

key assumptions and approach used income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

 

objective positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for all or a portion of deferred tax assets when significant negative evidence exists we think that the realization of future taxable income sufficient to utilize existing deferred tax assets is not morelikelythan not at this time the primary factors related to this conclusion are as follows 

 

  

at december 31 2010 our deferred tax assets reduced by the valuation allowance are completely offset by our deferred tax liabilities additionally our valuation allowance includes 17 million relating to the tax effects of other comprehensive income items primarily related to employee benefits these other comprehensive income items will be reduced in the event that the valuation allowance is no longer required 

under the accounting guidance for the uncertainty of income taxes we must reflect in our income tax provision the full benefit of all positions that will be taken in our income tax returns except to the extent that such positions are uncertain and fall below the recognition requirements of the guidance in the event that we determine that a tax position meets the uncertainty criteria an additional liability or an adjustment to our nols determined under the measurement criteria of the guidance will result this liability or adjustment is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit we periodically reassess the tax positions reflected in our tax returns for open years based on the latest information available and determine whether any portion of the tax benefits reflected therein should be treated as unrecognized the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit requires management to make significant assumptions about the expected outcomes of certain tax positions included in our filed or yet to be filed tax returns 

 

effect if different assumptions used as a result of the merger each of mirant and rri energy has separately determined whether or not each had experienced an ownership change as defined in the irc irc section irc § 382 provides in general that an ownership change occurs when there is a greater than 50percentage point increase in ownership of a company’s stock by new or existing stockholders who own or are deemed to own under irc § 382 5 or more of the loss company’s stock over a three year testing period irc § 382 limits the amount of premerger nols that can be used during any postownership change year to offset taxable income we have determined that rri energy did not experience an ownership change as defined above prior to the merger rri energy received guidance from the internal revenue service that specifies the methodology to be used in determining whether an ownership change has occurred under circumstances when a stockholder owns interests in each of the merging companies immediately prior to the merger our analysis concluded that sufficient overlapping stockholders of mirant and rri energy existed immediately prior to the merger such that the merger did not cause an ownership change for rri energy therefore rri energy’s premerger nols have not been adjusted for any irc § 382 limitation mirant experienced an ownership change as a result of the merger we have reduced the amount of the mirant nols available to offset postmerger taxable income based on the limits determined in accordance with irc § 382 

 

we continue to be under audit for multiple years by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions considerable judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of particular items that involve interpretations of complex tax laws a tax liability is recorded for filing positions with respect to which the outcome is uncertain and the recognition criteria under the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes has been met such liabilities are based on judgment and it can take many years to resolve a recorded liability such that the related filing position is no longer subject to question we have not recorded a liability for those proposed tax adjustments related to the current tax audits where we continue to think that our filing position meets the morelikelythannot threshold prescribed in the accounting guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes any adverse outcomes arising from these matters could result in a material change in the amount of our deferred taxes 

 

longlived assets 

 

estimated useful lives 

 

nature of estimates required the estimated useful lives of our longlived assets are used to compute depreciation expense determine the carrying value of asset retirement obligations and estimate expected future cash flows attributable to an asset for the purposes of impairment testing estimated useful lives are based in part on the assumption that we provide an appropriate level of capital expenditures while the assets are still in operation without these continued capital expenditures the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly 

 

key assumptions and approach used estimated useful lives are the mechanism by which we allocate the cost of longlived assets over the asset’s service period we perform depreciation studies periodically to update changes in estimated useful lives the actual useful life of an asset could be affected by changes in estimated or actual commodity prices environmental regulations various legal factors competitive forces and our liquidity and ability to sustain required maintenance expenditures and satisfy asset retirement obligations 

we use composite depreciation for groups of similar assets and establish an average useful life for each group of related assets in accordance with the accounting guidance related to evaluating longlived assets for impairment we cease depreciation on longlived assets classified as held for sale also we may revise the remaining useful life of an asset held and used subject to impairment testing see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our property plant and equipment 

 

we completed a depreciation study in the first quarter of 2010 for the legacy mirant generating facilities that resulted in a change to the estimated useful lives of its longlived assets the change in useful lives resulted in an increase of approximately 2 million in depreciation and amortization expense during 2010 in addition the change in useful lives also resulted in an increase of 9 million in asset retirement obligations and a corresponding increase of 9 million in property plant and equipment net at december 31 2010 

 

effect if different assumptions used the determination of estimated useful lives is dependent on subjective factors such as expected market conditions commodity prices and anticipated capital expenditures since composite depreciation rates are used the actual useful life of a particular asset may differ materially from the useful life estimated for the related group of assets a 10 increase in the weighted average useful lives of our facilities would result in a 32 million decrease in annual depreciation expense a 10 decrease in the weighted average useful lives of our facilities would result in a 39 million increase in annual depreciation expense in the event the useful lives of significant assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated depreciation expense may increase liabilities recognized for future asset retirement obligations may be insufficient and impairments in the carrying value of tangible and intangible assets may result 

 

asset retirement obligations 

 

nature of estimates required we account for asset retirement obligations under the accounting guidance for asset retirement obligations and conditional asset retirements this guidance requires an entity to recognize the fair value of a liability for conditional and unconditional asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred retirement obligations associated with longlived assets included within the scope of the accounting guidance are those obligations for which a requirement exists under enacted laws statutes and written or oral contracts including obligations arising under the doctrine of promissory estoppel asset retirement obligations are estimated using the estimated current cost to satisfy the retirement obligation increased for inflation through the expected period of retirement and discounted back to present value at our creditadjusted risk free rate we have identified certain asset retirement obligations within our power generating operations and have a noncurrent liability of 128 million recorded at december 31 2010 these asset retirement obligations are primarily related to asbestos abatement at some of our generating facilities the removal of oil storage tanks equipment on leased property and environmental obligations related to the closing of ash disposal sites 

 

during 2010 a thirdparty consulting firm completed a study on behalf of the company to determine the extent of asbestos present at certain of our generating facilities the consulting firm also provided us with cost estimates for the removal of the asbestos as a result we revised the cost estimates associated with our asset retirement obligations for asbestos removal at all of our generating facilities 

 

key assumptions and approach used the fair value of liabilities associated with the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations is estimated by applying a present value calculation to current engineering cost estimates of satisfying the obligations significant inputs to the present value calculation include current cost estimates estimated asset retirement dates and appropriate discount rates where appropriate multiple cost andor retirement scenarios have been probability weighted 

 

effect if different assumptions used we update liabilities associated with asset retirement obligations as significant assumptions change or as relevant new information becomes available 

asset impairments 

 

nature of estimates required we evaluate our longlived assets including intangible assets for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance the amount of an impairment charge is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value which generally represents the discounted expected future cash flows attributable to the asset or in the case of an asset we expect to sell at its fair value less costs to sell 

 

the accounting guidance related to impairments of longlived assets requires management to recognize an impairment charge if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a longlived asset or definitelived intangible asset is less than the carrying value of that asset we evaluate our longlived assets property plant and equipment and definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist or when we commit to sell the asset these evaluations of longlived assets and definitelived intangible assets may result from significant decreases in the market price of an asset a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset as well as other economic or operational analyses if the carrying amount is not recoverable an impairment charge is recorded 

 

the prices for power and natural gas remain low compared to several years ago the energy gross margin from our baseload coal units is negatively affected by these price levels additionally the current weak economic conditions and various demandresponse programs have resulted in a decrease in the forecasted gross margin of our generating facilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our longlived assets for indications of impairment however given the remaining useful lives for many of our generating facilities the total undiscounted cash flows for these generating facilities are more significantly affected by the longterm view of supply and demand than by the short term fluctuations in energy prices and demand as such we typically do not consider short term decreases in either energy prices or demand to cause an impairment evaluation our current expectation is that there will be a recovery in gross margins over time as a result of declining reserve margins in the markets in which we operate such that companies constructing new generating facilities can earn a reasonable rate of return on their investment this implies that gross margins and therefore cash flows in the future will be better than they are currently because market prices will need to rise high enough to provide an incentive for new generating facilities to be built and the entire market will realize the benefit of those higher gross margins 

 

key assumptions and approach used the impairment evaluation is a twostep process the first of which involves comparing the undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows the fair value of the asset must be calculated on a discounted basis the fair value of an asset is the price that would be received from a sale of the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for the measurement when available in the absence of quoted prices for identical or similar assets fair value is estimated using various internal and external valuation methods these methods include discounted cash flow analyses and reviewing available information on comparable transactions the determination of fair value requires management to apply judgment in estimating future capacity and energy prices environmental and maintenance expenditures and other cash flows our estimates of the fair value of the assets include significant assumptions about the timing of future cash flows remaining useful lives and the selection of a discount rate that represents the estimated weighted average cost of capital consistent with the risk inherent in future cash flows 

 

our longlived asset impairment assessments typically include assumptions about the following 

 

 89 

 

 

genon midatlantic generating facilities —we have goodwill recorded at our genon midatlantic registrant on its standalone balance sheet which is eliminated upon consolidation at genon north america in accordance with accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets we are required to test the goodwill balance at genon midatlantic at least annually we performed the goodwill assessment at october 31 2010 which by policy is our annual testing date in conducting step one of the goodwill impairment analysis for genon midatlantic we noted that the carrying value of its net assets exceeded the calculated fair value of genon midatlantic indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment analysis was required based on the results of the step one goodwill impairment analysis we tested genon midatlantic’s longlived assets for impairment under the accounting guidance related to impairment of longlived assets before completion of the step two test for goodwill 

 

upon completion of the assessment we determined that none of the genon midatlantic generating facilities were impaired at october 31 2010 

 

in december 2010 pjm published an updated load forecast which depicted a decrease in the expected demand from prior projections because of lower economic growth expectations as a result of the load forecast our current expectation is that there will be a decrease in the clearing prices for future capacity auctions in certain years the decrease in projected capacity revenue caused us to update our october 2010 impairment review of genon midatlantic’s longlived assets the sum of the updated december 2010 undiscounted cash flows for the chalk point and morgantown generating facilities exceeded their carrying values which represented approximately 23 and 17 of our total property plant and equipment net at december 31 2010 however we determined that the dickerson and potomac river generating facilities were impaired at december 31 2010 as the carrying values exceeded the updated december 2010 undiscounted cash flows we recorded fourth quarter impairment losses of 523 million and 42 million on our consolidated statement of operations to reduce the carrying values of the dickerson and potomac river generating facilities respectively to their estimated fair values in addition as a result of the full impairment of the potomac river generating facility we recorded 32 million in operations and maintenance expense and corresponding liabilities associated with our commitment to reduce particulate emissions at our potomac river generating facility as part of the agreement with the city of alexandria virginia the planned capital investment would not be recovered in future periods based on the current projected cash flows of the potomac river generating facility 

 

our assumptions related to future electricity and fuel prices were based on observable market prices to the extent available and longterm prices derived from proprietary fundamental market modeling the longterm capacity prices were based on the assumption that the pjm rpm capacity market would continue to be consistent with the current structure for the dickerson generating facility the total co 2 costs under the levy were determined by applying the cost of co 2 emissions to the expected generation forecasts our estimate of future cash flows related to the dickerson generating facility involved considering scenarios related to the montgomery county levy the scenarios are related to the success of the legal challenges to the law we also assumed that a federal co 2 capandtrade program would be instituted later this decade which would supplant all preexisting co 2 programs including the montgomery county levy in addition our assumptions included costs associated with compliance of other environmental regulations there are several transmission projects currently planned in the midatlantic region including the transallegheny interstate line trail midatlantic power pathway transmission line mapp and the potomacappalachian transmission line path the assumptions regarding the timing of these projects were based on the current status of permitting and construction of each project the assumptions regarding electricity demand were based on forecasts from pjm and assumptions for generating capacity additions and retirements included publiclyannounced projects which take into account renewable sources of electricity capital expenditures include the remaining contract retention payments for the completion of the maryland healthy air act pollution control equipment for our maryland generating facilities for our potomac river generating facility the cash flows also include the remaining 32 million that genon potomac river committed to spend to reduce particulate emissions as part of the agreement with the city of alexandria virginia 

the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analyses of the genon midatlantic generating facilities are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and changes in these assumptions could affect the amount of the impairment loss or result in additional future impairment losses a decrease in projected electricity prices or an increase in coal prices would decrease the future cash flows of the genon midatlantic generating facilities additionally decreases in the projected demand or changes to the structure of the pjm rpm capacity market could negatively affect the future capacity prices the facilities will earn the assumptions include the development of a potential federal capandtrade program for co 2 emissions if we are not compensated for the costs of complying with a federal co 2 program through allocated co 2 allowances increased electricity and capacity prices or decreased coal prices the cash flows of the genon midatlantic generating facilities would be negatively affected in addition if preexisting co 2 emission programs such as the rggi and the montgomery county levy are allowed to remain in effect under a federal co 2 program the cash flows of the genon midatlantic generating facilities would be negatively affected if the planned transmission projects are completed earlier than assumed this could negatively affect the cash flows of the facilities also changes in assumptions regarding generating capacity additions and retirements in the pjm region could affect the cash flows depending on the timing and extent of additions and retirements the assumptions include only those capital expenditures needed to keep the plants operational through their estimated remaining useful lives however changes in laws or regulations could require additional capital investments beyond amounts forecasted to keep the plants operational 

 

the estimates of future cash flows did not include contracts entered into to hedge economically the expected generation of genon midatlantic’s generating facilities the cash flows related to these contracts were excluded because they were not directly attributable to each of the generating facilities 

 

for purposes of impairment testing a longlived asset or assets must be grouped at the lowest level of independent identifiable cash flows each generating facility was determined to be its own group which included the leasehold improvements for the leased generating units at the dickerson and morgantown generating facilities see note 5c to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our genon midatlantic impairment analyses 

 

dickerson generating facility —we also reviewed our dickerson generating facility for impairment in the second quarter of 2010 upon the enactment of the co 2 levy by the montgomery county council upon completion of the assessment we determined that the dickerson generating facility was not impaired in the second quarter of 2010 

 

bowline generating facility — during the second quarter of 2010 the nyiso issued its annual peak load and energy forecast in its gold book the gold book reports projected electricity supply and demand for the new york control area for the next ten years the most recent gold book projects a significant decrease in future electricity demand as a result of current economic conditions and the expected future effects of demandside management programs in new york the expected reduction in future demand as a result of demandside management programs is being driven primarily by an energy efficiency program being instituted within the state of new york that will seek to achieve a 15 reduction from 2007 energy volumes by 2015 as a result of the projections in the gold book we evaluated the bowline generating facility for impairment in the second quarter of 2010 the sum of the probability weighted undiscounted cash flows for the bowline generating facility exceeded the carrying value as a result we did not record an impairment loss for the bowline generating facility during the second quarter of 2010 

 

genon bowline has challenged its property tax assessment for the 2009 and 2010 tax years although the assessment for the 2010 tax year was reduced significantly from the assessment received in 2009 the assessment continues to exceed significantly the estimated fair value of the generating facility 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 we identified certain operational issues that reduced the available capacity of the bowline generating facility we are in the process of evaluating longterm solutions for the generating facility but our current expectation is that the reduction in available capacity could extend through 2012 in the fourth quarter of 2010 we again evaluated the bowline generating facility for impairment because of the expected extended reduction in available capacity together with the pending property tax litigation and the effect of supply and demand assumptions in the nyiso’s gold book the sum of the probability weighted 

undiscounted cash flows for the bowline generating facility exceeded the carrying value therefore we did not record an impairment loss for the bowline generating facility during 2010 the carrying value of the bowline generating facility represented approximately 2 of our total property plant and equipment net at december 31 2010 see note 5c to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our impairment analysis of the bowline generating facility 

 

emissions allowances —in august 2010 the epa proposed a replacement for the cair the market prices for so 2 and no x emissions allowances declined as a result of the proposed rule our historical accounting policy has been to include emissions allowances in our asset groupings when evaluating longlived assets for impairment however to the extent the final epa rule significantly modifies or ends the current capandtrade program we may evaluate whether our so 2 and no x emissions allowances included in property plant and equipment and intangible assets should be evaluated separately from the underlying generating facilities the carrying value of the so 2 and no x emissions allowances included in property plant and equipment and intangible assets at december 31 2010 was 159 million see “environmental matters” for further information on the epa’s proposed replacement of the cair 

 

 

potrero generating facility —in the third quarter of 2009 genon potrero executed a settlement agreement with the city and county of san francisco in which it agreed to shut down the potrero generating facility when it is no longer needed for reliability as determined by the caiso that settlement agreement became effective in november 2009 in december 2010 the caiso provided genon potrero with the requisite notice of termination of the rmr agreement on january 19 2011 at the request of genon potrero the ferc approved changes to genon potrero’s rmr agreement to allow the caiso to terminate the rmr agreement effective february 28 2011 on february 28 2011 the potrero facility was shut down the potrero generating facility was fully depreciated at december 31 2010 

 

the asset group for genon potrero included intangible assets recorded at genon california north related to trading rights and development rights as a result of certain terms included in the settlement agreement we separately evaluated the trading and development rights associated with the potrero generating facility for impairment and determined that both of these intangible assets were fully impaired as of september 30 2009 accordingly we recognized an impairment loss of 9 million on our consolidated statement of operations to write off the carrying value of the intangible assets related to the potrero generating facility see note 5c to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our impairment analysis of the potrero generating facility and related intangible assets 

 

contra costa generating facility —on september 2 2009 genon delta entered into an agreement with pge for the 674 mw at contra costa units 6 and 7 for the period from november 2011 through april 2013 at the end of the agreement and subject to any necessary regulatory approval genon delta has agreed to retire contra costa units 6 and 7 which began operations in 1964 in furtherance of state and federal policies to retire aging power plants that utilize oncethrough cooling technology we evaluated the trading rights related to genon delta’s contra costa generating facility for impairment during the third quarter of 2009 as a result of the retirement provisions in the tolling agreement because the contra costa generating facility is under contract with pge through the expected shutdown date we determined the intangible asset was fully impaired as of september 30 2009 we recorded an impairment loss of 5 million on our consolidated statement of operations to write off the carrying value of the trading rights related to the contra costa generating facility 

 

canal generating facility —our 1126 mw canal generating facility is located in the lower sema load zone in the isone control area isone previously has determined that at times it is necessary for the canal generating facility to operate to meet local reliability criteria for sema when it is not economic for the canal generating facility to operate based upon prevailing market prices when the canal generating facility operates to meet local reliability criteria we are compensated at the price we bid into the isone pursuant to isone market rules rather than at the market price 

during 2009 nstar electric company completed planned upgrades to the sema transmission system these upgrades are expected to reduce the need for the canal generating facility to operate and caused a reduction in energy gross margin compared to historical levels the final phase of these transmission upgrades was completed in the third quarter of 2009 with the completion of the transmission upgrades we expect that the future revenues of the canal generating facility will be principally capacity revenue from isone forward capacity market our current projections indicate that the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value of the facility at december 31 2009 as a result we did not record an impairment charge because of the transmission upgrades we continue to monitor developments related to our canal generating facility including the npdes and swd permit see item 1 “business—environmental regulation” for further information related to the npdes and swd permit for the canal generating facility the carrying value of the canal generating facility represented approximately 3 of our total property plant and equipment net at december 31 2010 

 

genon midatlantic generating facilities —we have goodwill recorded at our genon midatlantic registrant on its standalone balance sheet which is eliminated upon consolidation at genon north america in accordance with accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets we are required to test the goodwill balance at genon midatlantic at least annually we performed the goodwill assessment at october 31 2009 which by policy is our annual testing date in conducting step one of the goodwill impairment analysis for genon midatlantic we noted that the carrying value of its net assets exceeded the calculated fair value of genon midatlantic indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment analysis was required based on the results of the step one goodwill impairment analysis we tested genon midatlantic’s longlived assets for impairment under the accounting guidance related to impairment of longlived assets before completion of the step two test for goodwill during 2009 the continued decline in average natural gas prices caused power prices to decline in the eastern pjm region additionally weak economic conditions and various demandresponse programs have resulted in a decrease in the forecasted gross margin of the genon midatlantic generating facilities 

 

upon completion of our assessment which was based on the accounting guidance related to the impairment of longlived assets we determined that the potomac river generating facility was impaired as the carrying value exceeded the undiscounted cash flows we recorded an impairment loss of 207 million on our consolidated statement of operations to reduce the carrying value of the potomac river generating facility to its estimated fair value in performing our impairment assessment we noted that the undiscounted cash flows for other genon midatlantic generating facilities also decreased significantly from the prior year we determined that no other genon midatlantic longlived assets were impaired at october 31 2009 

 

 

genon midatlantic generating facilities —we performed the goodwill assessment for genon midatlantic at october 31 2008 which by policy is our annual testing date in conducting step one of the goodwill impairment analysis for genon midatlantic we noted that the carrying value of its net assets exceeded the calculated fair value of genon midatlantic indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment analysis was required based on the results of the step one goodwill impairment analysis we tested genon midatlantic’s longlived assets for impairment under the accounting guidance related to impairment of longlived assets before completion of the step two test for goodwill upon completion of our assessment which was based on the accounting guidance related to the impairment of longlived assets we determined that no further analysis of the longlived assets was needed at december 31 2008 

 

effect if different assumptions used the estimates and assumptions used to determine whether an impairment exists are subject to a high degree of uncertainty the estimated fair value of an asset would change if different estimates and assumptions were used in our applied valuation techniques including estimated undiscounted cash flows discount rates and remaining useful lives for assets held and used if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to additional losses that could be material to our results of operations 

 

see note 5c to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on impairments 

loss contingencies 

 

nature of estimates required we record loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated we consider loss contingency estimates to be critical accounting estimates because they entail significant judgment regarding probabilities and ranges of exposure and the ultimate outcome of the proceedings is unknown and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows we currently have loss contingencies related to litigation environmental matters tax matters and others 

 

key assumptions and approach used the determination of a loss contingency requires significant judgment as to the expected outcome of each contingency in future periods in making the determination as to potential losses and probability of loss we consider all available positive and negative evidence including the expected outcome of potential litigation we record our best estimate of a loss or the low end of our range if no estimate is better than another estimate within a range of estimates when the loss is considered probable as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to the contingency and revise our estimates in our evaluation of legal matters management holds discussions with applicable legal counsel and relies on analysis of case law and legal precedents 

 

effect if different assumptions used revisions in our estimates of potential liabilities could materially affect our results of operations and the ultimate resolution may be materially different from the estimates that we make

we are currently involved in legal proceedings we estimate the range of liability through discussions with applicable legal counsel and analysis of case law and legal precedents we record our best estimate of a loss or the low end of our range if no estimate is better than another estimate within a range of estimates when the loss is considered probable and can be reasonably estimated as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially affect our results of operations and the ultimate resolution may be materially different from the estimates that we make

fair value measurements 

 

we are exposed to market risk primarily associated with commodity prices we also consider risks associated with interest rates and credit when valuing our derivative financial instruments 

 

the estimated net fair value of our derivative contract assets and liabilities was a net asset of 720 million and 702 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively the following tables provide a summary of 

the factors affecting the change in fair value of the derivative contract asset and liability accounts for 2009 and 2010 respectively 

 

 

 

 

  

in may 2010 we concluded that we could no longer assert that physical delivery is probable for many of our coal agreements the conclusion was based on expected generation levels changes observed in the coal markets and substantial progress in the construction of a coal blending facility at the morgantown generating facility that will allow for greater flexibility of our coal supply because we can no longer assert that physical delivery of coal from these agreements is probable we are required to apply fair value accounting for these contracts in the current period and prospectively the fair value of these derivative contracts is included in the tables above 

 

we did not elect the fair value option for any financial instruments under the accounting guidance however we do transact using derivative financial instruments which are required to be recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets under the accounting guidance related to derivative financial instruments 

at december 31 2010 the estimated net fair value of our derivative contract assets and liabilities are asset liability 

 

 

 

the fair values shown in the table above are subject to significant changes as a result of fluctuating commodity forward market prices volatility and credit risk for further discussion of how we determine these fair values see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—recently adopted accounting guidance and critical accounting estimates—critical accounting estimates” in item 7 of this form 10k 

 

commodity price risk 

 

in connection with our business of generating electricity we are exposed to energy commodity price risk associated with the acquisition of fuel and emissions allowances needed to generate electricity the price of electricity produced and sold and the fair value of our fuel inventories a portion of our fuel requirements is purchased in the spot market and a portion of the electricity we produce is sold in the spot market in addition the open positions in our proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities expose us to risks associated with changes in energy commodity prices 

 

as a result our financial performance varies depending on changes in the prices of energy and energyrelated commodities see item 7 “critical accounting estimates” for a discussion of the accounting treatment for asset management proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities 

 

the financial performance of our business of generating electricity is influenced by the difference between the variable cost of converting a fuel such as natural gas coal or oil into electricity and the variable revenue we receive from the sale of that electricity the difference between the cost of a specific fuel used to generate one mwh of electricity and the market value of the electricity generated is commonly referred to as 

the “conversion spread” absent the effects of our derivative contract activities the operating margins that we realize are equal to the difference between the aggregate conversion spread and the cost of operating the facilities that produce the electricity sold 

 

conversion spreads are dependent on a variety of factors that influence the cost of fuel and the sales price of the electricity generated over the longer term including conversion spreads of other generating facilities in the regions in which we operate facility outages weather and general economic conditions as a result of these influences the cost of fuel and electricity prices do not always change in the same magnitude or direction which results in conversion spreads for a particular generating facility widening or narrowing or becoming negative over any given period 

 

through our asset management activities we enter into a variety of exchangetraded and otc energy and energyrelated derivative financial instruments such as forward contracts futures contracts option contracts and financial swap agreements to manage our exposure to commodity price risks these contracts have varying terms and durations which range from a few days to years depending on the instrument our proprietary trading activities also utilize similar derivative contracts in markets where we have a physical presence to attempt to generate incremental gross margin our fuel oil management activities use derivative financial instruments to hedge economically the fair value of our physical fuel oil inventories optimize the approximately three million barrels of storage capacity that we own or lease as well as attempt to profit from market opportunities related to timing andor differences in the pricing of various products 

 

derivative energy contracts that are required to be reflected at fair value are presented as derivative contract assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets the net changes in their fair market values are recognized in income in the period of change the determination of fair value considers various factors including closing exchange or otc market price quotations time value credit quality liquidity and volatility factors underlying options see item 7 “critical accounting estimates” for the accounting treatment of asset management proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities 

 

counterparty credit risk 

 

the valuation of our derivative contract assets is affected by the default risk of the counterparties with which we transact we recognized a reserve which is reflected as a reduction of our derivative contract assets related to counterparty credit risk of 21 million and 13 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

 

in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting guidance we calculate the credit reserve through consideration of observable market inputs when available we calculate our credit reserve using published spreads where available or proxies based upon published spreads on credit default swaps for our counterparties applied to our current exposure and potential loss exposure from the financial commitments in our risk management portfolio we do not however transact in credit default swaps or any other credit derivative potential loss exposure is calculated as our current exposure plus a calculated var over the remaining life of the contracts 

 

our noncollateralized power hedges entered into by genon midatlantic with financial institutions which represent 42 of our net notional power position at december 31 2010 are senior unsecured obligations of genon midatlantic and the counterparties and do not require either party to post cash collateral for initial margin or for securing exposure as a result of changes in power or natural gas prices our coal contracts included in derivative contract assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets also do not require either party to post cash collateral for initial margin or for securing exposure as a result of changes in coal prices an increase of 10 in the spread of credit default swaps of our trading partners would result in an increase of 2 million in our credit reserve at december 31 2010 

 

once we have delivered a physical commodity or agreed to financial settlement terms we are subject to collection risk collection risk is similar to credit risk and collection risk is accounted for when we establish our provision for uncollectible accounts we manage this risk using the same techniques and processes used in credit risk discussed above 

we also monitor counterparty credit concentration risk on both an individual basis and a group counterparty basis see note 4c to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our counterparty credit concentration risk 

 

genon credit risk 

 

in valuing our derivative contract liabilities we apply a valuation adjustment for our nonperformance which is based on the probability of our default our methodology incorporates published spreads on our credit default swaps where available or proxies based upon published spreads an increase of 10 in the spread of our credit default swap rate would have an immaterial effect on our consolidated statement of operations for 2010 

 

broker quotes 

 

the fair value of our derivative contract assets and liabilities is based largely on observable quoted prices from exchanges and unadjusted indicative quoted prices from independent brokers in active markets who regularly facilitate our transactions an active market is considered to have transactions with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis we think that these prices represent the best available information for valuation purposes in determining the fair value of our derivative contract assets and liabilities we use thirdparty market pricing where available note 4 to our consolidated financial statements explains the fair value hierarchy our transactions in level 1 of the fair value hierarchy primarily consist of natural gas and crude oil futures traded on the nymex and swaps cleared against nymex prices for these transactions we use the unadjusted published settled prices on the valuation date our transactions in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy primarily include nonexchangetraded derivatives such as otc forwards swaps and options and certain energy derivative instruments that are cleared and settled through exchanges we value these transactions using indicative quoted prices from independent brokers or other widelyaccepted valuation methodologies transactions are classified in level 2 if substantially all greater than 90 of the fair value can be corroborated using observable market inputs such as transactable broker quotes in accordance with the exit price objective under the fair value measurements accounting guidance the fair value of our derivative contract assets and liabilities is determined based on the net underlying position of the recorded derivative contract assets and liabilities using bid prices for our assets and ask prices for liabilities the quotes that we obtain from brokers are nonbinding in nature but are from brokers that typically transact in the market being quoted and are based on their knowledge of market transactions on the valuation date we typically obtain multiple broker quotes on the valuation date for each delivery location that extend for the tenor of our underlying contracts the number of quotes that we can obtain depends on the relative liquidity of the delivery location on the valuation date if multiple broker quotes are received for a contract we use an average of the quoted bid or ask prices if only one broker quote is received for a delivery location and it cannot be validated through other external sources we will assign the quote to a lower level within the fair value hierarchy in some instances we may combine broker quotes for a liquid delivery hub with broker quotes for the price spread between the liquid delivery hub and the delivery location under the contract we also may apply interpolation techniques to value monthly strips if broker quotes are only available on a seasonal or annual basis we perform validation procedures on the broker quotes at least on a monthly basis the validation procedures include reviewing the quotes for accuracy and comparing them to our internal price curves in certain instances we may discard a broker quote if it is a clear outlier and multiple other quotes are obtained at december 31 2010 we obtained broker quotes for 100 of our delivery locations classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy 

 

inactive markets are considered to be those markets with few transactions noncurrent pricing or prices that vary over time or among market makers our transactions in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy may involve transactions whereby observable market data such as broker quotes are not available for substantially all of the tenor of the contract or we are only able to obtain indicative broker quotes that cannot be corroborated by observable market data in such cases we may apply valuation techniques such as extrapolation and other quantitative methods to determine fair value proprietary models may also be used to determine the fair value of certain of our derivative contract assets and liabilities that may be structured or otherwise 

tailored our techniques for fair value estimation include assumptions for market prices correlation and volatility the degree of estimation increases for longer duration contracts contracts with multiple pricing features option contracts and offhub delivery points at december 31 2010 our assets and liabilities classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy represented approximately 3 of our total assets and 9 of our total liabilities measured at fair value 

 

value at risk 

 

our risk management policy limits our trading to certain products and contains limits and restrictions related to our asset management proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities 

 

we manage the price risk associated with asset management activities through a variety of methods our risk management policy requires that asset management activities are restricted to only those activities that are riskreducing we ensure compliance with this restriction at the transactional level by testing each individual transaction executed relative to the overall asset position 

 

we also use var to measure the market price risk of our energy asset portfolio as a result of potential changes in market prices var is a statistical model that provides an estimate of potential loss we calculate var based on the parametric variancecovariance approach utilizing a 95 confidence interval and a oneday holding period on a rolling 24month forward looking period additionally we estimate correlation based on historical commodity price changes volatilities are based on a combination of historical price changes and implied market rates 

 

var is calculated quarterly on an asset management portfolio comprised of marktomarket and non marktomarket energy assets and liabilities including generating facilities and bilateral physical and financial transactions asset management var levels are substantially reduced as a result of our decision to actively hedge economically in the forward markets the commodity price risk related to the expected generation and fuel usage of our generating facilities see item 1 “business—asset management” for discussion of our hedging strategies 

 

the following table summarizes yearend average high and low var for our asset management portfolio 

 

 

 

we calculate var daily on portfolios consisting of marktomarket and non marktomarket bilateral physical and financial transactions related to our proprietary trading activities and fuel oil management operations 

 

the following table summarizes yearend average high and low var for our proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities 

 

 

 

because of inherent limitations of statistical measures such as var and the seasonality of changes in market prices the var calculation may not reflect the full extent of our commodity price risk exposure on our cash flows and liquidity additionally actual changes in the fair value of marktomarket energy assets and liabilities could differ from the calculated var and such changes could have a material effect on our financial results 

interest rate risk 

 

fair value measurement 

 

we are also subject to interest rate risk when discounting to account for time value in determining the fair value of our derivative contract assets and liabilities the nominal value of our derivative contract assets and liabilities is discounted using a libor forward interest rate curve based on the tenor of our transactions it is estimated that a one percentage point change in market interest rates would result in a change of 22 million to our derivative contract assets and a change of 8 million to our derivative contract liabilities at december 31 2010 

 

debt 

 

some of our debt is subject to variable interest rates including our 698 million senior secured term loan and our 788 million senior secured revolving credit facility borrowings under these facilities will bear interest at the libor rate plus a margin of 425 and 350 per annum respectively however for the new term loan facility only in no event shall the libor rate be less than 175 per annum we do not currently plan to enter into any interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the variable interest rate risk associated with our term loan facility or revolving credit facility in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk with the senior secured term loan fully drawn it is estimated that a one percentage point change in market interest rates above 175 would result in a change in our annual interest expense of approximately 7 million if the senior secured revolving credit facility was fully drawn it is estimated that a one percentage point change in market interest rates would result in a change in our annual interest expense of approximately 8 million 

 

the genon marsh landing credit agreement is also subject to variable interest rates the credit facility consists of a 155 million tranche a senior secured term loan facility a 345 million tranche b senior secured term loan facility a 50 million senior secured letter of credit facility to support genon marsh landing’s debt service reserve requirements and a 100 million senior secured letter of credit facility to support genon marsh landing’s collateral requirements under its ppa with pge interest on the tranche a term loans will be based on a base rate or a libor rate plus an initial applicable margin of 15 for base rate loans and 25 for libor loans with such margin increasing 025 every three years interest on the tranche b term loans will be based on a base rate or a libor rate plus an initial applicable margin of 175 for base rate loans and 275 for libor loans with such margin increasing 025 every three years genon marsh landing entered into interest rate swaps to reduce the interest rate risks with respect to the term loan the effective interest rate that genon marsh landing will pay for the term loan from the commercial operations date is 591 plus the stepup in margin over time the interest rate swaps cover 100 of the expected outstanding term loan balances during the operating period and a substantial portion of the expected outstanding term loan balances during the construction period the remaining borrowings during the construction period are still subject to variability in interest rates at the projected peak borrowing levels during the construction period a one percentage point change in market interest rates would result in a change in our annual interest cost of less than 1 million 

 

coal agreement risk 

 

our coal supply comes primarily from the northern appalachian and central appalachian coal regions we enter into contracts of varying tenors to secure appropriate quantities of fuel that meet the varying specifications of our generating facilities for our coalfired generating facilities we purchase most of our coal from a small number of suppliers under contracts with terms of varying lengths some of which extend to 2013 and one that extends to 2020 excluding our keystone and conemaugh generating facilities which are not 100 owned by us and excluding our seward generating facility which burns waste coal supplied by an allrequirements contract we had exposure to three counterparties at december 31 2010 and 2009 that each represented an exposure of more than 10 of our total coal commitments by volume for the respective 

succeeding year and in aggregate represented approximately 76 and 61 of our total coal commitments at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively at december 31 2010 one counterparty represented an exposure of 52 of these total coal commitments by volume 

 

in addition we have nonperformance risk associated with our coal agreements there is risk that our coal suppliers may not provide the contractual quantities on the dates specified within the agreements or the deliveries may be carried over to future periods if our coal suppliers do not perform in accordance with the agreements we may have to procure coal in the market to meet our needs or power in the market to meet our obligations in addition generally our coal suppliers do not have investment grade credit ratings nor do they post collateral with us and accordingly we may have limited ability to collect damages in the event of default by such suppliers we seek to mitigate this risk through diversification of coal suppliers to the extent possible and through guarantees despite this there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful in mitigating credit risk from coal suppliers nonperformance or default risk by our coal suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows see note 4c to our consolidated financial statements for further explanation of these agreements and our credit concentration tables 

 

certain of our coal contracts are not required to be recorded at fair value under the accounting guidance for derivative financial instruments as such these contracts are not included in derivative contract assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets these contracts contain pricing terms that are favorable compared to forward market prices at december 31 2010 and are projected to provide a 95 million benefit to our realized value of hedges through 2013 as the coal is utilized in the production of electricity

customers 

 

in fiscal 2010 and 2008 one distributor ingram micro accounted for 10 of our total net revenue in both periods in fiscal 2009 ingram micro did not account for 10 of total net revenue our distributor arrangements with ingram micro consist of several nonexclusive independently negotiated agreements with its subsidiaries each of which cover different countries or regions each of these agreements is separately negotiated and is independent of any other contract such as a master distribution agreement and these agreements are not based on the same form of contract in fiscal 2009 and 2008 one reseller digital river accounted for 10 and 11 of our total net revenues respectively in fiscal 2010 we launched a new internallydeveloped ecommerce platform which will reduce our reliance on digital river 

acquisitions 

 

our acquisitions are designed to enhance the features and functionality of our existing products and extend our product leadership in core markets we consider time to market synergies with existing products and potential market share gains when evaluating the economics of acquisitions of technologies product lines or companies we may acquire andor dispose of other technologies products and companies in the future 

 

during fiscal 2010 we completed the following acquisitions 

 

 

 

for further discussion of our acquisitions see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

 

competition 

 

our markets are consolidating highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology we are focused on integrating across the product portfolio and include nextgeneration technology capabilities into our solution set in order to differentiate ourselves from the competition we believe that the principal competitive factors necessary to be successful in our industry include time to market price reputation financial stability breadth of product offerings customer support brand recognition and effective sales and marketing efforts 

 

in addition to the competition we face from direct competitors we face indirect or potential competition from retailers application providers operating system providers network equipment manufacturers and other oems who may provide various solutions and functions in their current and future products we also compete for access to retail distribution channels and for the attention of customers at the retail level and in corporate accounts in addition we compete with other software companies operating system providers network equipment manufacturers and other oems to acquire technologies products or companies and to publish software developed by third parties we also compete with other software companies in our effort to place our products on the computer equipment sold to consumers and enterprises by oems 

 

the competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below 

 

consumer 

 

some of the channels in which our consumer products are offered are highly competitive our competitors are intensely focused on customer acquisition which has led such competitors to offer their technology for free engage in aggressive marketing or enter into competitive partnerships our primary competitors in the consumer segment are mcafee inc “mcafee” and trend micro inc “trend micro” there are also several smaller regional security companies and freeware providers that we compete against primarily in the emea and apj regions for our consumer backup offerings our primary competitors are mozy inc owned by emc corporation “emc” and carbonite inc 

 

security and compliance 

 

in the security and management markets we compete against many companies that offer competing products to our solutions our primary competitors in the security and management market are landesk software inc mcafee microsoft corporation “microsoft” and trend micro there are also several smaller regional security companies that we compete against primarily in the emea and apj regions 

 

in the saas security market our primary competitors are google inc’s postini services and microsoft 

storage and server management 

 

the markets for storage and backup are intensely competitive our primary competitors are ca inc commvault systems inc emc hewlettpackard company “hp” ibm corp “ibm” microsoft sun microsystems inc acquired by oracle corporation and vmware inc 

 

services 

 

we believe that the principal competitive factors for our services segment include technical capability customer responsiveness and our ability to hire and retain talented and experienced services personnel our primary competitors in the services segment are emc hp ibm and regional specialized consulting firms in the managed security services business our primary competitors are ibm and secureworks inc 

 

intellectual property 

 

protective measures 

 

we regard some of the features of our internal operations software and documentation as proprietary and rely on copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures contractual arrangements and other measures to protect our proprietary information our intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that enables us to gain recognition for our products services and technology and enhance our competitive position 

 

as part of our confidentiality procedures we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with our employees distributors and corporate partners and we enter into license agreements with respect to our software documentation and other proprietary information these license agreements are generally nontransferable and have a perpetual term we also educate our employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to protect our facilities equipment and networks 

 

trademarks patents copyrights and licenses 

 

symantec and the symantec logo are trademarks or registered trademarks in the us and other countries in addition to symantec and the symantec logo we have used registered andor applied to register other specific trademarks and service marks to help distinguish our products technologies and services from those of our competitors in the us and foreign countries and jurisdictions we enforce our trademark service mark and trade name rights in the us and abroad the duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country and in the us we generally are able to maintain our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in use 

 

we have a number of us and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications including patents and rights to patent applications acquired through strategic transactions which relate to various aspects of our products and technology the duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and for the us is typically 17 years from the date of issuance of the patent or 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application resulting in the patent which we believe is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products 

 

our products are protected under us and international copyright laws and laws related to the protection of intellectual property and proprietary information we take measures to label such products with the appropriate proprietary rights notices and we actively enforce such rights in the us and abroad however these measures may not provide sufficient protection and our intellectual property rights may be challenged in addition we license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our products and generally must rely on the third party to protect the licensed intellectual property rights while we believe that our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent trademark license or other intellectual property right 

 

seasonality 

 

as is typical for many large software companies our business is seasonal software license and maintenance orders are generally higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and lower in our first and second fiscal quarters a 

significant decline in license and maintenance orders is typical in the first quarter of our fiscal year as compared to license and maintenance orders in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year in addition we generally receive a higher volume of software license and maintenance orders in the last month of a quarter with orders concentrated in the later part of that month we believe that this seasonality primarily reflects customer spending patterns and budget cycles as well as the impact of compensation incentive plans for our sales personnel revenue generally reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than orders because revenue is not recognized until an order is shipped or services are performed and other revenue recognition criteria are met and because a significant portion of our inperiod revenue is provided by the ratable recognition of our deferred revenue balance 

 

employees 

 

as of april 2 2010 we employed more than 17400 people worldwide approximately 47 percent of whom reside in the us approximately 6200 employees work in sales and marketing 5600 in research and development 4200 in support and services and 1400 in management and administration

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below the list is not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock 

 

adverse global economic events may harm our business operating results and financial condition 

 

adverse macroeconomic conditions could negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition under a number of different scenarios during challenging economic times and periods of high unemployment current or potential customers may delay or forgo decisions to license new products or additional instances of existing products upgrade their existing hardware or operating environments which upgrades are often a catalyst for new purchases of our software or purchase services customers may also have difficulties in obtaining the requisite thirdparty financing to complete the purchase of our products and services an adverse macroeconomic environment could also subject us to increased credit risk should customers be unable to pay us or delay paying us for previously purchased products and services accordingly reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase in addition weakness in the market for end users of our products could harm the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could then delay paying their obligations to us or experience other financial difficulties this would further increase our credit risk exposure and potentially cause delays in our recognition of revenue on sales to these customers 

 

in addition financial institution difficulties may make it more difficult either to utilize our existing debt capacity or otherwise obtain financing for our operations investing activities including potential acquisitions or financing activities specific economic trends such as declines in the demand for pcs servers and other computing devices or softness in corporate information technology spending could have an even more direct and harmful impact on our business 

fluctuations in demand for our products and services are driven by many factors and a decrease in demand for our products could adversely affect our financial results 

 

we are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and services due to a variety of factors including general economic conditions competition product obsolescence technological change shifts in buying patterns financial difficulties and budget constraints of our current and potential customers levels of broadband usage awareness of security threats to it systems and other factors while such factors may in some periods increase product sales fluctuations in demand can also negatively impact our product sales if demand for our products declines because of general economic conditions or for other reasons our revenues and gross margin could be adversely affected 

 

if we are unable to develop new and enhanced products and services that achieve widespread market acceptance or if we are unable to continually improve the performance features and reliability of our existing products and services or adapt our business model to keep pace with industry trends our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

 

our future success depends on our ability to respond to the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing or introducing new products product upgrades and services on a timely basis we have in the past incurred and will continue to incur significant research and development expenses as we strive to remain competitive new product development and introduction involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including 

 

  

in addition if we cannot adapt our business models to keep pace with industry trends our revenue could be negatively impacted in connection with our enterprise software offerings we license our applications on a variety of bases such as per server per processor or based on performance criteria such as per amount of data processed or stored if enterprises continue to migrate towards solutions such as virtualization which allow enterprises to run multiple applications and operating systems on a single server and thereby reduce the number of servers they are required to own and operate we may experience lower license revenues unless we are able to successfully change our enterprise licensing model or sell additional software to take into account the impact of these new solutions 

 

if we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges or if our new products product upgrades and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

we operate in a highly competitive environment and our competitors may gain market share in the markets for our products that could adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to decline 

 

we operate in intensely competitive markets that experience rapid technological developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements if we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a drop in revenue that could adversely affect our business and operating results to compete successfully we must maintain a successful research and development effort to develop new products and services and enhance existing products and services effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors appropriately respond to competitive strategies and effectively adapt to technological changes and changes in the ways that our information is accessed used and stored within our enterprise and consumer markets if we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors or to changing technological and customer demands we could experience a negative effect on our competitive position and our financial results 

 

our traditional competitors include independent software vendors that offer software products that directly compete with our product offerings in addition to competing with these vendors directly for sales to endusers of our products we compete with them for the opportunity to have our products bundled with the product offerings of our strategic partners such as computer hardware oems and isps our competitors could gain market share from us if any of these strategic partners replace our products with the products of our competitors or if they more actively promote our competitors’ products than our products in addition software vendors who have bundled our products with theirs may choose to bundle their software with their own or other vendors’ software or may limit our access to standard product interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop products for their platform 

 

we face growing competition from network equipment and computer hardware manufacturers and large operating system providers these firms are increasingly developing and incorporating into their products data protection and storage and server management software that competes at some levels with our product offerings our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our products 

 

security protection is also offered by some of our competitors at prices lower than our prices or in some cases is bundled for free some companies offer the lowerpriced or free security products within their computer hardware or software products that are inferior to our products our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive these security products as replacing the need for more effective full featured products such as those that we provide the expansion of these competitive trends could have a significant negative impact on our sales and financial results 

 

another growing industry trend is the saas business model where software vendors develop and host their applications for use by customers over the internet this allows enterprises to obtain the benefits of commercially licensed internally operated software without the associated complexity or high initial setup and operational costs advances in the saas business model could enable the growth of our competitors and could affect the success of our traditional software licensing models we are offering our own saas offerings including those related to our fiscal 2009 acquisition of message labs and we continue to incorporate these offerings into our licensing model however we may not be able to successfully incorporate our saas offerings into our current licensing models our inability to successfully develop and market new and existing saas product offerings could cause us to lose business to competitors 

 

many of our competitors have greater financial technical sales marketing or other resources than we do and consequently may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their products instead of ours we also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the markets in which we compete 

if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to their customers our operating results could be adversely affected 

 

we sell our products to customers around the world through multitiered sales and distribution networks sales through these different channels involve distinct risks including the following 

 

direct sales a significant portion of our revenues from enterprise products is derived from sales by our direct sales force to endusers special risks associated with this sales channel include 

 

  

indirect sales channels a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels including distributors that sell our products to endusers and other resellers this channel involves a number of risks including 

 

  

oem sales channels a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales through our oem partners that incorporate our products into or bundle our products with their products our reliance on this sales channel involves many risks including 

 

 15 

 

if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels successfully these channels may conflict with one another or otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate which could reduce our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our competitive position some of our distribution partners have experienced financial difficulties in the past and if our partners suffer financial difficulties in the future because of general economic conditions or for other reasons these partners may delay paying their obligations to us and we may have reduced sales or increased bad debt expense that could adversely affect our operating results in addition reliance on multiple channels subjects us to events that could cause unpredictability in demand which could increase the risk that we may be unable to plan effectively for the future and could result in adverse operating results in future periods 

 

we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions that give rise to risks and challenges that could adversely affect our future financial results 

 

we have in the past acquired and we expect to acquire in the future other businesses business units and technologies acquisitions can involve a number of special risks and challenges including 

 

  

integrating acquired businesses has been and will continue to be a complex time consuming and expensive process and can impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

 

if integration of our acquired businesses is not successful we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects that we currently do not foresee to integrate acquired businesses we must implement our technology systems in the acquired operations and integrate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations we also must effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired business organizations into our own in a way that aligns various interests and may need to enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions 

 

any of the foregoing and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of acquisitions in addition because acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition 

 

we have not historically maintained substantial levels of indebtedness and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liabilities 

 

in june 2006 we sold 21 billion in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes as a result of the sale of the notes we have a substantially greater amount of longterm debt than we maintained prior to that sale in addition we have entered into a credit facility with a borrowing capacity of 1 billion as of april 2 2010 we had no borrowings under our credit facility from time to time in the future we may also incur indebtedness in addition 

to the amount available under our credit facility our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect our flexibility to take advantage of certain corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations of our outstanding convertible notes 11 billion matures and is repayable in june 2011 and the balance is due in june 2013 we may be required to use all or a substantial portion of our cash balance to repay these notes on maturity unless we can obtain new financing 

 

our international operations involve risks that could increase our expenses adversely affect our operating results and require increased time and attention of our management 

 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the us and we have significant operations outside of the us including engineering sales customer support and production we plan to expand our international operations but such expansion is contingent upon the financial performance of our existing international operations as well as our identification of growth opportunities our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations including 

 

  

a significant portion of our transactions outside of the us are denominated in foreign currencies accordingly our revenues and expenses will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates we expect to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future especially if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales or our operations outside the united states continue to increase 

 

the level of corporate tax from sales to our nonus customers is less than the level of tax from sales to our us customers this benefit is contingent upon existing tax regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits 

our products are complex and operate in a wide variety of computer configurations which could result in errors or product failures 

 

because we offer very complex products undetected errors failures or bugs may occur especially when products are first introduced or when new versions are released our products are often installed and used in largescale computing environments with different operating systems system management software and equipment and networking configurations which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors failures or bugs in our products our customers’ computing environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and nonstandard configurations that make prerelease testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and timeconsuming in addition despite testing by us and others errors failures or bugs may not be found in new products or releases until after commencement of commercial shipments in the past we have discovered software errors failures and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and in some cases may have experienced delayed or lost revenues as a result of these errors 

 

errors failures or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity damage to our brand product returns loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products loss of competitive position or claims by customers or others many of our enduser customers use our products in applications that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other less critical software products in addition if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity or availability occurs in one of our enduser customer’s systems regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions delays or cessation of our product licensing which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating results 

 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees lose key personnel fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully or fail to manage our employee base effectively we may be unable to develop new and enhanced products and services effectively manage or expand our business or increase our revenues 

 

our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain our key management technical sales marketing finance and other critical personnel our officers and other key personnel are employeesatwill and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them competition for people with the specific skills that we require is significant in order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace we believe that we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees in addition we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation plans and accounting rules require us to treat the issuance of employee stock options and other forms of equitybased compensation as compensation expense as a result we may decide to issue fewer equitybased incentives and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees or conversely if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

 

from time to time key personnel leave our company while we strive to reduce the negative impact of such changes the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and the results of our operations in addition hiring training and successfully integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time consuming may cause additional disruptions to our operations and may be unsuccessful which could negatively impact future revenues 

from time to time we are a party to class action lawsuits which often require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses and which could if not determined favorably negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

we have been named as a party to class action lawsuits and we may be named in additional litigation the expense of defending such litigation may be costly and divert management’s attention from the daytoday operations of our business which could adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows in addition an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could negatively impact our business results of operations and cash flows 

 

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

 

from time to time we receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others including claims regarding patents copyrights and trademarks in addition former employers of our former current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers any such claim with or without merit could result in costly litigation and distract management from daytoday operations if we are not successful in defending such claims we could be required to stop selling delay shipments of or redesign our products pay monetary amounts as damages enter into royalty or licensing arrangements or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers we cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

 

in addition we license and use software from third parties in our business these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and may expose us to additional liability this liability or our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

 

if we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology our financial results could be harmed 

 

most of our software and underlying technology is proprietary we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws however all of these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties third parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise obtain use distribute and sell our proprietary information without authorization third parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently by designing around our patents our shrinkwrap license agreements are not signed by licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions furthermore the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the us and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries the unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could adversely affect our ability to access software operating system and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor or cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products to their customers in addition any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in alone or through our alliances with the business software alliance “bsa” or the software  information industry association “siia” could be costly may distract management from daytoday operations and may lead to additional claims against us which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

some of our products contain “open source” software and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business 

 

certain of our products are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under socalled “open source” licenses which may include by way of example the gnu general public license “gpl” gnu lesser general public license “lgpl” the mozilla public license the bsd license and the apache 

license some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use by the terms of certain open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner in addition to risks related to license requirements usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third party commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software we have established processes to help alleviate these risks including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products in addition many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated and could if not properly addressed negatively affect our business 

 

our software products and website may be subject to intentional disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future sales 

 

although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional disruptions we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance of our products and harm our reputation as a company similarly experienced computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our website and misappropriate proprietary information andor cause interruptions of our services because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques the theft andor unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an event could adversely affect our competitive position reputation brand and future sales of our products and our customers may assert claims against us related to resulting losses of confidential or proprietary information our business could be subject to significant disruption and we could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm in the event of such incidents and claims 

 

increased customer demands on our technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results 

 

we offer technical support services with many of our products we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers further customer demand for these services without corresponding revenues could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results 

 

we have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide consumer support functions to third party service providers if these companies experience financial difficulties do not maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level under these contracts the level of support services to our customers may be significantly disrupted which could materially harm our relationships with these customers 

 

accounting charges may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results 

 

our financial results have been in the past and may continue to be in the future materially affected by noncash and other accounting charges including 

 

 20 

 

for example during fiscal 2009 we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 74 billion resulting in a significant net loss for the year goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant as we determined they did in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and our evaluation depends to a large degree on estimates and assumptions made by our management our assessment of any impairment of goodwill is based on a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units to the carrying value of that reporting unit our determination of fair value relies on management’s assumptions of our future revenues operating costs and other relevant factors if management’s estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other key assumptions such as the discount rate applied to future operating results the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units could change significantly which could result in a goodwill impairment charge in addition we evaluate our other longlived assets including intangible assets whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate that the value of these assets might be impaired if we determine that impairment has occurred we could incur an impairment charge against the value of these assets 

 

the foregoing types of accounting charges may also be incurred in connection with or as a result of other business acquisitions the price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by the foregoing accounting charges 

 

our effective tax rate may increase which could increase our income tax expense and reduce increase our net income loss 

 

our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

 

  

the price of our common stock could decline if our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate 

 

we report our results of operations based on our determinations of the amount of taxes owed in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate from time to time we receive notices that a tax authority in a particular jurisdiction in which we are subject to taxes has determined that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority we are regularly engaged in discussions and sometimes disputes with these tax authorities we are engaged in disputes of this nature at this time if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

fluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected the price of our common stock in the past and could affect our stock price in the future 

 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and which could adversely affect our operations and operating results if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors our stock price could be negatively affected any volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance 

factors associated with our industry the operation of our business and the markets for our products may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate including 

 

  

any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 

 

our stock price may be volatile in the future and you could lose the value of your investment 

 

the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future and as a result you could lose the value of your investment the market price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

overview 

 

our business 

 

symantec is a global provider of security storage and systems management solutions that help businesses and consumers secure and manage their information we provide customers worldwide with software and services that protect manage and control information risks related to security data protection storage compliance and systems management we help our customers manage cost complexity and compliance by protecting their it infrastructure as they seek to maximize value from their it investments 

 

fiscal calendar 

 

we have a 5253week fiscal year ending on the friday closest to march 31 unless otherwise stated references to fiscal years in this report relate to fiscal year and periods ended april 2 2010 april 3 2009 and march 28 2008 fiscal 2010 and 2008 each consisted of 52 weeks while fiscal 2009 consisted of 53 weeks our 2011 fiscal year will consist of 52 weeks and will end on april 1 2011 

 

our operating segments 

 

our operating segments are significant strategic business units that offer different products and services distinguished by customer needs since the march 2008 quarter we have operated in five operating segments consumer security and compliance storage and server management services and other during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we changed our reporting segments to better align to our operating structure resulting in the enterprise vault products that were formerly included in the security and compliance segment being moved to the storage and server management segment also our saas offerings moved to either the security and compliance segment or the storage and server management segment from the services segment based on the nature of the service delivered as a result the revenue contribution from our saas offering primarily benefited our security and compliance segment following the move we revised the segment information for the prior year to conform to the new presentation for further descriptions of our operating segments see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments 

 

financial results and trends 

 

revenue decreased for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 the challenging economic environment resulted in corporate it budgets being reduced and spending has slowed from previous levels smaller it budgets have led some of our corporate customers to purchase smaller volumes of our products particularly in the storage and server management segment in addition our storage business within the storage and server management segment has 

been adversely affected for the last several quarters by the deceleration of demand in the server market additionally we were also particularly affected by lower new license sales of our storage products on the solaris platform if the economic conditions affecting global markets continue or it spending remains tight we may continue to experience slower or negative revenue growth and our business and operating results might suffer in light of these economic conditions we will continue to align our cost structure with our revenue expectations during fiscal 2010 we experienced significantly higher yearoveryear oem placement fee payments resulting from an increase in pc unit shipments on which our products were bundled these increased payments had an adverse impact on our operating income and operating margins during the fiscal 2010 periods particularly for our consumer segment we expect to see the revenue benefit from these increased placement fees in future periods 

 

we launched a new internallydeveloped and operated ecommerce platform during fiscal 2010 that will replace the current online store for the company’s nortonbranded consumer products worldwide excluding japan we believe this will improve our ability to identify and capitalize on emerging customer needs and market trends and enhance the endtoend experience our customers have with us we have been transitioning customers to the new online store in a phased approach the new online store is gradually ramping up worldwide coverage and is expected to reach full capacity by june 30 2010 the development and rollout of our new ecommerce platform adversely affected the operating margins for our consumer segment during fiscal 2010 

 

the fees we have paid to digital river have historically been recorded as an offset to revenue as a result of bringing the ecommerce business inhouse our consumer revenue is expected to increase due to the elimination of this offset to revenue we expect revenue to increase in the range of 80 to 100 million in fiscal 2011 from this change conversely the cost of running our own ecommerce platform will be classified primarily in operating expenses with some amounts flowing through cost of revenue therefore operating expenses and cost of goods sold will both rise by a corresponding amount in 2011 and we believe the net impact to earnings per share for 2011 will be neutral over time we expect our new ecommerce strategy to increase consumer operating margins we expect to capture the differential between what we have traditionally paid digital river and the ongoing cost of operating our own ecommerce platform 

 

fluctuations in the us dollar compared to foreign currencies favorably impacted our international revenue by approximately 14 million for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 foreign currency fluctuations had relatively little overall impact on our international revenue growth for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 we are unable to predict the extent to which revenue in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates if our level of international sales and expenses increase in the future changes in foreign exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenue and operating results 

 

as discussed above under “fiscal calendar” fiscal 2010 and 2008 consisted of 52 weeks whereas fiscal 2009 consisted of 53 weeks the extra week contributed to additional amortization of deferred revenue of approximately 75 million in fiscal 2009 

 

our net income was 714 million for fiscal 2010 and was positively impacted by a decrease of 128 million in cost of revenue related to certain acquired product rights from our acquisition of veritas becoming fully amortized during the first quarter of our fiscal 2010 net income was also positively impacted by a 785 million tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 resulting from the december 2009 veritas v commissioner us tax court decision relating to the veritas 2000 and 2001 tax years in addition net income for fiscal 2010 was positively impacted by 47 million of net gain from the liquidation of certain foreign legal entities 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates which include judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly historically our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results however actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions if 

actual results differ from these estimates and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of operations and in certain situations could have a material adverse effect on liquidity and our financial condition 

 

a critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially impact the operating results or financial condition we believe that the estimates described below represent our critical accounting estimates as they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see also note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

 

revenue recognition 

 

we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry we recognize revenue primarily pursuant to the requirements under the authoritative guidance on software revenue recognition and any applicable amendments or modifications revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and require us to make many estimates 

 

for arrangements that include multiple elements including perpetual software licenses and maintenance andor services packaged products with content updates managed security services and subscriptions we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” of the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance consumer product content updates and arrangements where vsoe does not exist such as managed security services and subscriptions deferred revenue totaled approximately 32 billion as of april 2 2010 of which 371 million was classified as longterm deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets vsoe of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our standalone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period changes to the elements in a software arrangement the ability to identify vsoe for those elements the fair value of the respective elements and increasing flexibility in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount recognized in the current period and deferred over time 

 

for arrangements that include both software and nonsoftware elements that are within the scope of the newly adopted accounting standards further described below under “recently adopted authoritative guidance” we allocate revenue to the software deliverables as a group and nonsoftware deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the new accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vsoe ii thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” and iii best estimate of the selling price “esp” when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe we use esp to allocate the arrangement fees to the deliverables 

 

for our consumer products that include content updates we recognize revenue and the associated cost of revenue ratably over the term of the subscription upon sellthrough to endusers as the subscription period commences on the date of sale to the enduser we defer revenue and cost of revenue amounts for unsold product held by our distributors and resellers 

 

we expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate inventory of consumer packaged products to meet future customer demand which is generally four or six weeks of customer demand based on recent buying trends we ship product to our distributors and resellers at their request and based on valid purchase orders our distributors and resellers base the quantity of orders on their estimates to meet future customer demand which may exceed the expected level of a four or six week supply we offer limited rights of return if the inventory held by our distributors and resellers is below the expected level of a four or six week supply we estimate future returns under these limited rights of return in accordance with the authoritative guidance on revenue recognition we typically offer liberal rights of return if inventory held by our distributors and resellers exceeds the expected level because 

we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of excess inventory that will be returned we primarily offset deferred revenue against trade accounts receivable for the amount of revenue in excess of the expected inventory levels 

 

arrangements for managed security services and saas offerings are generally offered to our customers over a specified period of time and we recognize the related revenue ratably over the maintenance subscription or service period 

 

reserves for product returns we reserve for estimated product returns as an offset to revenue based primarily on historical trends we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels as an offset to deferred revenue if we made different estimates material differences could result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented more or less product may be returned than what was estimated andor the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what was estimated these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make actual results differ from our return estimates 

 

reserves for rebates we estimate and record reserves for channel and enduser rebates as an offset to revenue for consumer products that include content updates rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue over the term of the subscription our estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and resellers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs which are typically entered into quarterly our reserves for enduser rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the promotional programs actual sales during the promotion amount of actual redemptions received historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program and the value of the rebate we also consider current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserves for rebates if actual redemptions differ from our estimates material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented 

 

valuation of goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets 

 

when we acquire businesses we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies and historical experience these estimates can include but are not limited to the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and if such events occur we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities 

 

goodwill we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable at the reporting unit level our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments before performing the goodwill impairment test we first assess the value of longlived assets in each reporting unit including tangible and intangible assets we then perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill in the first step we compare the estimated fair value of equity of each reporting unit to its allocated carrying value book value of equity if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the equity associated with that unit there is an indicator of impairment and we must perform the second step of the impairment test this second step involves determining the implied fair value of that reporting unit’s goodwill in a manner similar to the purchase price allocation for an acquired business using the reporting unit’s calculated fair value as an assumed purchase price if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we would record an impairment loss equal to the excess 

 

the process of estimating the fair value and carrying value of our reporting units’ equity requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis many assets and liabilities such as accounts receivable and property and equipment are not specifically allocated to an individual reporting unit and therefore we apply judgment to 

allocate the assets and liabilities and this allocation affects the carrying value of the respective reporting units similarly we use judgment to allocate goodwill to the reporting units based on relative fair values the use of relative fair values has been necessary for certain reporting units due to changes in our operating structure in prior years to determine a reporting unit’s fair value we use the income approach under which we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit we evaluate the reasonableness of this approach with the market approach which involves a review of the carrying value of our assets relative to our market capitalization and to the valuation of publicly traded companies operating in the same or similar lines of business 

 

applying the income approach requires that we make a number of important estimates and assumptions we estimate the future cash flows of each reporting unit based on historical and forecasted revenue and operating costs this in turn involves further estimates such as estimates of future revenue and expense growth rates and foreign exchange rates in addition we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation this discount rate is based on the estimated weightedaverage cost of capital for each reporting unit and may change from year to year for example in our valuation process in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we used a lower discount rate than in the prior year due to stabilized risk associated with the global economic conditions changes in these key estimates and assumptions or in other assumptions used in this process could materially affect our impairment analysis for a given year 

 

as of april 2 2010 our goodwill balance was 46 billion based on the impairment analysis performed on january 2 2010 we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the unit by more than 20 of the carrying value while discount rates are only one of several important estimates used in the analysis we determined that an increase of one percentage point in the discount rate used for each respective reporting unit would not have resulted in an impairment indicator for any unit at the time of this analysis 

 

a number of factors many of which we have no ability to control could affect our financial condition operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed these factors include 

 

  

intangible assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset group’s carrying amount may not be recoverable in addition for intangible assets with indefinite lives we review such assets for impairment on an annual basis consistent with the timing of the annual evaluation for goodwill an impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount such impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset group and its fair value our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue operating costs and other relevant factors if management’s estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other assumptions the estimate of the fair value of our identifiable intangible assets could change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 

we record impairment charges on developed technology or acquired product rights when we determine that the net realizable value of the assets may not be recoverable to determine the net realizable value of the assets we use the estimated future gross revenue from each product our estimated future gross revenue of each product is based on company forecasts and is subject to change 

 

longlived assets including assets held for sale we assess longlived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the longlived assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment we measure any impairment of longlived assets based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method using assumptions determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors which could change and cause a material impact to our operating results or financial condition we record impairment charges on longlived assets held for sale when we determine that the carrying value of the longlived assets may not be recoverable in determining our fair value we obtain and consider market value appraisal information from thirdparties 

 

fair value of financial instruments 

 

the assessment of fair value for our financial instruments is based on the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements which establishes a fair value hierarchy that is based on three levels of inputs and requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 

 

we use inputs such as actual trade data benchmark yields brokerdealer quotes and other similar data which are obtained from independent pricing vendors quoted market prices or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities we use such pricing data as the primary input to which we have not made any material adjustments to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio and we are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates the fair value and inputs are reviewed for reasonableness may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to their estimate of fair value 

 

as of april 2 2010 our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included 24 billion of assets our cash equivalents primarily consist of money market funds bank securities and government securities and represent 99 of our total financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis 

 

as of april 2 2010 21 billion of investments were classified as level 1 most of which represents investments in money market funds these were classified as level 1 because their valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets determining fair value for level 1 instruments generally does not require significant management judgment 

 

as of april 2 2010 342 million of investments were classified as level 2 of which 216 million and 116 million representing a combined 97 of level 2 financial instruments represent investments in bank securities and government securities respectively these were classified as level 2 because either 1 the estimated fair value is based on the fair value of similar securities or 2 their valuations were based on pricing models with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market prices for identical securities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets level 2 inputs generally are based on nonbinding market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data quoted prices for similar instruments andor modelderived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities while determining the fair value for level 2 instruments does not necessarily require significant management judgment it generally involves the following level of judgment and subjectivity 

 

 33 

  

  

as of april 2 2010 we have no financial instruments with unobservable inputs classified in level 3 under the hierarchy set forth under the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements level 3 instruments generally would include unobservable inputs to be used in the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities the determination of fair value for level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance stockbased compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period of the respective award 

 

determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment we use the blackscholes optionpricing model to determine the fair value of stock options the determination of the grant date fair value of options using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the options actual and projected employee stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends 

 

we estimate the expected life of options granted based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and postvesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option expected volatility is based on the average of historical volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of traded options the risk free interest rate is equal to the us treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal to the expected life we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future accordingly our expected dividend yield is zero 

 

in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation we only record stockbased compensation expense for awards that are expected to vest as a result judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience actual forfeitures may differ if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted when we record a trueup for the difference in the period that the awards vest 

 

contingencies and litigation 

 

we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on contingencies we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes from a potential claim or legal proceeding as well as potential ranges of probable losses when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and reasonably estimable a determination of the amount of accrued liabilities required if any for these contingencies is made after the analysis of each separate matter because of uncertainties related to these matters we base our estimates on the information available at the time of our assessment as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to its pending claims and litigation and 

may revise our estimates any revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our operating results and financial position 

 

income taxes 

 

we are required to compute our income taxes in each federal state and international jurisdiction in which we operate this process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes the income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as current or longterm deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets our judgments assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations 

 

we account for uncertain tax issues pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a twostep approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which such determination is made 

 

we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and based on this assessment establish a valuation allowance if required our determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a number of assumptions judgments and estimates including forecasted earnings future taxable income and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations 

 

in july 2008 we reached an agreement with the irs concerning our eligibility to claim a lower tax rate on a distribution made from a veritas foreign subsidiary prior to the july 2005 acquisition the distribution was intended to be made pursuant to the american jobs creation act of 2004 and therefore eligible for a 525 effective us federal rate of tax in lieu of the 35 statutory rate the final impact of this agreement is not yet known since this relates to the taxability of earnings that are otherwise the subject of the tax years 20002001 transfer pricing dispute which in turn is being addressed in the us tax court to the extent that we owe taxes as a result of the transfer pricing dispute we anticipate that the incremental tax due from this negotiated agreement will decrease we currently estimate that the most probable outcome from this negotiated agreement will be that we will owe 13 million or less for which an accrual has already been made we made a payment of 130 million to the irs for this matter in may 2006 we applied 110 million of this payment as a deposit on the outstanding transfer pricing matter for the tax years 20002004 

 

results of operations 

 

total net revenue 

 

 

net revenue decreased for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to a 336 million decrease in license revenue partially offset by a 171 million increase in content subscription and maintenance revenue the net decrease was primarily due to decreased license revenue from our storage and server management segment as a result of the overall market weakness in server sales and tight it spending due to the global economic slowdown and the uncertainty surrounding the acquisition of sun microsystems inc by oracle corporation this decrease was partially offset by strength in our consumer segment and the items discussed above under “financial results and trends” 

 

net revenue increased for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to a 302 million increase in content subscription and maintenance revenue this increase was primarily related to increased revenue in our storage and server management and services segments and the items discussed above under “financial results and trends” 

 

content subscription and maintenance revenue 

 

 

 

content subscription and maintenance revenue increased for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of strength in our consumer segment primarily due to increases in revenue from acquired security products and the gradual global ramp up of our ecommerce platform as well as revenue from our fiscal 2009 acquisitions of messagelabs and pc tools and the items discussed above under “financial results and trends” 

 

content subscription and maintenance revenue increased for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to an aggregate increase in content subscription and maintenance revenue from the storage and server management and services segments of 237 million the increase in these two segments’ revenue was largely attributable to demand for our storage and server management products and consulting services as a result of increased demand for security and storage solutions this increased demand was driven by the proliferation of structured and unstructured data and increasing sales of services in conjunction with our license sales the increased demand was also a result of our focus on offering our customers a more comprehensive it solution furthermore growth in our customer base through acquisitions and new license sales resulted in an increase to content subscription and maintenance revenue because a large number of our customers renew their annual maintenance contracts 

 

license revenue 

 

 

 

license revenue decreased for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to the global economic slowdown and customers emphasizing purchases of smaller volumes of new licenses consistent with their near term needs during the periods presented as well as for the items discussed above under “financial results and trends” 

 

license revenue decreased slightly for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to a decrease in revenue related to our security and compliance products offset by an increase in revenue related to our storage and server management products the decreases in security and compliance license revenue was primarily a result of the challenging economic environment and a decline in demand from small and medium businesses the offsetting increases in storage and server management license revenue are a result of increased demand for storage solutions driven by the proliferation of structured and unstructured data

operating income for the consumer segment decreased for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 as expense growth outpaced revenue growth total expenses for the segment increased primarily as a result of the higher oem placement fees and costs associated with our development and operation of our new proprietary ecommerce platform both discussed above under “financial results and trends” 

 

consumer revenue increased for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to an increase from our core consumer security products in our electronic channels partially offset by a decrease in our retail channels in addition consumer revenue increased from the sale of our consumer services and acquired security products 

 

operating income for this segment increased for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 as the increase in revenue more than offset the increase in expenses total expenses for fiscal 2009 increased primarily as a result of the pc tools acquisition

other segment 

 

 

 

 

  

revenue from our other segment consists primarily of sunset products and products nearing the end of their life cycle the operating loss of our other segment includes general and administrative expenses amortization of acquired product rights other intangible assets and other assets impairment charges for goodwill and assets held for sale charges such as stockbased compensation and restructuring and certain indirect costs that are not charged to the other operating segments the operating loss of our other segment for fiscal 2009 primarily consisted of a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 74 billion 

 

net revenue by geographic region

emea revenue decreased slightly for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to decreased revenue related to our consumer and security and compliance segments as a result of a strengthening us dollar and a decrease in endpoint security product sales to small and medium sized businesses this decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue related to our storage and server management and services segments 

 

asia pacific japan revenue increased for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to increased revenue related to our storage and server management segment 

 

our international sales are and will continue to be a significant portion of our net revenue as a result net revenue will continue to be affected by foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the us dollar we are 

unable to predict the extent to which revenue in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates if international sales become a greater portion of our total sales in the future changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenue and operating results 

 

cost of revenue

cost of license remained consistent as a percentage of the related revenue for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 decreases in manufacturing and site license costs were partially offset by higher royalties 

amortization of acquired product rights 

 

 

 

acquired product rights are comprised of developed technologies and patents from acquired companies the decrease in amortization for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to certain acquired product rights from our acquisition of veritas becoming fully amortized during the first quarter of our fiscal 2010 this decrease was partially offset by additional amortization from product rights acquired from swapdrive pc tools and messagelabs during fiscal 2009 

 

the increase in amortization for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to amortization associated with our swapdrive pc tools and messagelabs acquisitions during fiscal 2009 offset in part by the apm business divestiture in fiscal 2008 

 

operating expenses 

 

operating expenses overview

our operating expenses for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 increased as a result of an additional week during fiscal 2009 which was partially offset by a stronger us dollar in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

 

our operating expenses for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 were favorably impacted by the restructuring plans discussed below 

 

sales and marketing expense 

 

 

 

sales and marketing expense remained relatively flat during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 fiscal 2010 sales and marketing expense reflects the impact of our prior year restructuring plan partially offset by increases in headcount related expenses from our fiscal 2009 acquisitions and increases in consumer oem fees and costs associated with the development and operations of our new proprietary ecommerce platform as a percent of net revenue sales and marketing expense increased as a result of these factors coupled with the decrease in total net revenue

impairment of goodwill and loss and impairment of assets held for sale 

 

 

 

in accordance with the authoritative guidance on goodwill and other intangibles we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and any time business conditions indicate a potential change in recoverability during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we performed our annual impairment analysis and determined that goodwill was not impaired during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 we concluded that there were impairment indicators including the challenging economic environment and a decline in our market capitalization which required us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis the analysis was not completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and an estimated impairment charge of 70 billion was recorded the analysis was subsequently finalized and an additional impairment charge of 413 million was included in our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 as a result we incurred a total impairment charge of 74 billion for fiscal 2009 we also performed our annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and determined that no additional impairment charge was necessary 

 

for the purposes of this analysis our estimates of fair value are based on a combination of the income approach and the market approach the income approach estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on the future discounted cash flows we also consider the market approach which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on comparable market prices 

 

during fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 we recognized impairments of 20 million 46 million and 93 million respectively on certain land and buildings classified as held for sale the impairments were recorded in accordance with the authoritative guidance that requires a longlived asset classified as held for sale to be measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell also in fiscal 2010 and 2008 we sold assets for 42 million and 98 million which resulted in losses of 10 million and 2 million respectively we sold properties in fiscal 2009 for 40 million with an immaterial loss 

 

nonoperating income and expense 

 

 

 

the decrease in interest income during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 is due to a lower average yield on our invested cash and shortterm investment balances interest expense for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 remained relatively consistent other income net for fiscal 2010 includes net gains of 47 million from the liquidation of certain foreign legal entities the liquidations resulted in the release of cumulative translation adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income related to these entities 

interest income decreased during fiscal 2009 and 2008 primarily due to lower average cash balances outstanding and lower average yields on our invested cash and shortterm investment balances interest expense for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2010 remained relatively consistent other income net for fiscal 2008 includes a net gain from settlements of litigation of approximately 59 million 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

 

 

our effective tax rate was approximately 13 3 and 34 in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

the tax expense in fiscal 2010 was significantly reduced by the following benefits recognized in the year 1 785 million tax benefit arising from the veritas v commissioner tax court decision see further discussion below 2 11 million tax benefit from the reduction of our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets 3 17 million tax benefit from lapses of statutes of limitation 4 9 million tax benefit from the conclusion of us and foreign audits 5 7 million tax benefit to adjust taxes provided in prior periods and 6 65 million tax benefit from current year discrete events the change in the valuation allowance follows discussions with irish revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 the result of which accelerates the timing of the use of certain irish tax loss carryforwards in the future the tax expense in fiscal 2009 was materially impacted by the inclusion of a 56 million tax benefit associated with the 70 billion impairment of goodwill in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 

 

the effective tax rates for all periods presented otherwise reflects the benefits of lowertaxed foreign earnings and losses from our joint venture with huawei “joint venture” fiscal 2010 and 2009 only domestic manufacturing incentives and research and development credits partially offset by state income taxes 

 

as a result of the impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2009 we have cumulative pretax book losses as measured by the current and prior two years we considered the negative evidence of this cumulative pretax book loss position on our ability to continue to recognize deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income for realization levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in part i item 1a risk factors set forth in this annual report we considered the following as positive evidence the vast majority of the goodwill impairment is not deductible for tax purposes and thus will not result in tax losses we have a strong consistent taxpaying history we have substantial us federal income tax carryback potential and we have substantial amounts of scheduled future reversals of taxable temporary differences from our deferred tax liabilities we have concluded that this positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence and thus that the deferred tax assets as of april 2 2010 of 519 million after application of the valuation allowances are realizable on a “more likely than not” basis 

 

on may 27 2009 the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit overturned a 2005 us tax court ruling in xilinx v commissioner  holding that stockbased compensation related rd must be shared by the participants of a rd cost sharing arrangement the ninth circuit held that related parties to such an arrangement must share stock option costs notwithstanding the us tax court’s finding that unrelated parties in such an arrangement would not share such costs symantec has a similar rd cost sharing arrangement in place the ninth circuit’s reversal of the us tax court’s decision changed our estimate of stock option related tax benefits previously recognized under the authoritative guidance on income taxes as a result of the ninth circuit’s ruling we increased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits recording a tax expense of approximately 7 million and a reduction of additional paidin capital of approximately 30 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 on january 13 2010 the ninth circuit court of appeals withdrew its issued opinion on march 22 2010 the ninth circuit court of appeals issued a revised decision affirming the decision of the tax court the ninth circuit’s decision agreed with the tax court’s finding that related companies are not required to share such costs as a result of the ninth circuit’s revised ruling we released the liability established in our first quarter of fiscal 2010 which resulted in a 7 million tax benefit and increase of additional paidin capital of approximately 30 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 for fiscal 2010 there was no net income tax expense impact 

on march 29 2006 we received a notice of deficiency from the irs claiming that we owe 867 million of additional taxes excluding interest and penalties for the 2000 and 2001 tax years based on an audit of veritas on june 26 2006 we filed a petition with the us tax court protesting the irs claim for such additional taxes during july 2008 we completed the trial phase of the tax court case which dealt with the remaining issue covered in the assessment at trial the irs changed its position with respect to this remaining issue which decreased the remaining amount at issue from 832 million to 545 million excluding interest we filed our posttrial briefs in october 2008 and rebuttal briefs in november 2008 with the us tax court 

 

on december 10 2009 the us tax court issued its opinion finding that our transfer pricing methodology with appropriate adjustments was the best method for assessing the value of the transaction at issue between veritas and its offshore subsidiary the tax court judge provided guidance as to how adjustments would be made to correct the application of the method used by veritas we remeasured and decreased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits accordingly resulting in a 785 million tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 final computations as directed by the ruling are not complete and accordingly we may make further adjustments to our tax liability in the future the tax court ruling is subject to appeal we have 110 million on deposit with the irs pertaining to this matter we do not anticipate making any further federal tax payments for these years 

 

on december 2 2009 we received a revenue agent’s report from the irs for the veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years assessing additional taxes due we agree with 30 million of the tax assessment excluding interest but will contest the other 80 million of tax assessed and all penalties the unagreed issues concern transfer pricing matters comparable to the one that was resolved in our favor in the veritas v commissioner tax court decision on january 15 2010 we filed a protest with the irs in connection with the 80 million of tax assessed 

 

we continue to monitor the progress of ongoing tax controversies and the impact if any of the expected tolling of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions 

 

loss from joint venture 

 

 

 

on february 5 2008 symantec formed a joint venture with a subsidiary of huawei technologies co limited “huawei” the joint venture is domiciled in hong kong with principal operations in chengdu china the joint venture develops manufactures markets and supports security and storage appliances for global telecommunications carriers and enterprise customers 

 

as described in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report the joint venture adopted new authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables during its period ended december 31 2009 which was applied to the beginning of its fiscal year as a result of the joint venture’s adoption of the guidance our net income was 12 million higher for fiscal 2010 than it would have been under the preexisting accounting guidance we account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting under this method we record our proportionate share of the joint venture’s net income or loss based on the quarterly financial statements of the joint venture we record our proportionate share of net income or loss one quarter in arrears

liquidity and capital resources 

 

sources of cash 

 

we have historically relied on cash flow from operations borrowings under a credit facility and issuances of convertible notes and equity securities for our liquidity needs 

 

in fiscal 2007 we entered into a fiveyear 1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in july 2011 in order to be able to draw on the credit facility we must maintain certain covenants including a specified ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and impairment as well as certain other nonfinancial covenants as of april 2 2010 we were in compliance with all required covenants and there was no outstanding balance on the credit facility 

 

as of april 2 2010 we had cash and cash equivalents of 30 billion and shortterm investments of 15 million resulting in a net liquidity position of approximately 40 billion which is defined as unused availability of the credit facility cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

 

we believe that our existing cash and investment balances our borrowing capacity our ability to issue new debt instruments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures requirements for at least the next 12 months 

 

uses of cash 

 

our principal cash requirements include working capital capital expenditures payments of principal and interest on our debt and payments of taxes in addition we regularly evaluate our ability to repurchase stock pay debts and acquire other businesses 

 

line of credit there were no borrowings under our credit facility for the fiscal year ended april 2 2010 for the fiscal year ended april 3 2009 we repaid the entire 200 million principal amount plus 3 million of accrued interest that we borrowed during fiscal 2008 under the credit facility

stock repurchases we repurchased 34 million 42 million and 81 million shares for 553 million 700 million and 15 billion during fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively as of april 2 2010 we had 747 million remaining under the plan authorized for future repurchases

indemnifications 

 

as permitted under delaware law we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is not limited however we have directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 

 

we provide limited product warranties and the majority of our software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging that our software 

infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party historically payments made under these provisions have been immaterial we monitor the conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a loss has occurred 

 

recently adopted authoritative guidance 

 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we adopted new authoritative guidance on convertible debt instruments that requires the issuer of convertible debt instruments with cash settlement features to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument the debt is recognized at the present value of its cash flows discounted using the issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance the equity component is recognized as the difference between the proceeds from the issuance of the note and the fair value of the liability this guidance also requires interest to be accreted as interest expense of the resultant debt discount over the expected life of the debt this guidance applies to the 075 convertible senior notes due june 15 2011 and the 100 convertible senior notes due june 15 2013 collectively referred to as the senior notes prior to the adoption of this guidance the liability of the senior notes was carried at its principal value and only the contractual interest expense was recognized in our consolidated statements of operations because this guidance requires retrospective adoption we were required to adjust all periods for which the senior notes were outstanding before the date of adoption see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional information on the adoption 

 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we adopted new authoritative guidance on business combinations that requires an acquiring entity to measure and recognize identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions the changes include the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs the valuation of any noncontrolling interest at acquisition date fair value the recording of acquired contingent liabilities at acquisition date fair value and the subsequent remeasurement of such liabilities after the acquisition date the recognition of capitalized inprocess research and development the accounting for acquisitionrelated restructuring cost accruals subsequent to the acquisition date and the recognition of changes in the acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance our acquisitions during fiscal 2010 have been accounted for using this new authoritative guidance see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for information on our business combinations the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements however it could have a material impact on future periods 

 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we adopted new authoritative guidance on the recognition and measurement of otherthantemporary impairments for debt securities that replaced the preexisting “intent and ability” indicator this guidance specifies that if the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost basis an otherthantemporary impairment is triggered in circumstances in which 1 an entity has an intent to sell the security 2 it is more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 the entity does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security that is a credit loss exists otherthantemporary impairments are separated into amounts representing credit losses which are recognized in earnings and amounts related to all other factors which are recognized in other comprehensive income loss the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we adopted new authoritative guidance on noncontrolling minority interests in consolidated financial statements which includes requiring noncontrolling interests be classified as a component of consolidated stockholders’ equity and to identify earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests reported as part of consolidated earnings the guidance also requires the gain or loss on the deconsolidated subsidiary be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we adopted new authoritative guidance that specifies the way in which fair value measurements should be made for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and specifies additional disclosures related to these fair value measurements the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we adopted new authoritative guidance on revenue recognition for multipleelement arrangements the new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of 

accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price the new standard establishes a selling price hierarchy that allows for the use of an estimated selling price to determine the allocation of arrangement consideration to a deliverable in a multiple element arrangement where neither vsoe nor tpe is available for that deliverable concurrently to issuing the new standard the fasb also issued new authoritative guidance that excludes tangible products that contain software and nonsoftware elements that function together to provide the tangible products’ essential functionality from the scope of software revenue guidance we have elected to adopt the new accounting standards as of the beginning of fiscal 2010 for applicable transactions originating from or materially modified after april 2 2009 our adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements our joint venture also adopted the accounting standards during its period ended december 31 2009 which was applied to the beginning of its fiscal year as a result of the joint venture’s adoption of the accounting standards our loss from joint venture decreased by 12 million during our fiscal 2010 see note 6 for further details regarding the impact of this guidance on our joint venture 

 

recently issued authoritative guidance 

 

in june 2009 the fasb issued revised guidance which changes the model for determining whether an entity should consolidate a variable interest entity “vie” the standard replaces the quantitativebased risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a vie with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a vie and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive the entity’s residual returns the statement is effective as of the first quarter of our fiscal 2011 and early adoption is prohibited we do not expect the adoption of this new authoritative guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices we may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies we do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio and the potential losses arising from changes in interest rates our investment objective is to achieve the maximum return compatible with capital preservation and our liquidity requirements our strategy is to invest our cash in a manner that preserves capital maintains sufficient liquidity to meet our cash requirements maximizes yields consistent with approved credit risk and limits inappropriate concentrations of investment by sector credit or issuer we classify our cash equivalents and shortterm investments in accordance with the authoritative guidance on investments we consider investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents we classify our shortterm investments as availableforsale shortterm investments consist of marketable debt or equity securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days our cash equivalents and shortterm investment portfolios consist primarily of money market funds commercial paper corporate debt securities and us government and governmentsponsored debt securities our shortterm investments do not include equity investments in privately held companies our shortterm investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of tax included in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheets the amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be otherthantemporary on availableforsale securities are included in other income net in the consolidated statements of operations we use the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon sale of shortterm investments 

the following table presents the fair value and hypothetical changes in fair values on shortterm investments sensitive to changes in interest rates  in millions  

 

 

 

 

  

the modeling technique used above measures the change in fair market value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus 150 bps plus 100 bps plus 50 bps minus 25 bps and minus 75 bps 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

we conduct business in 44 currencies through our worldwide operations and as such we are exposed to foreign currency risk foreign currency risks are associated with our cash and cash equivalents investments receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies fluctuations in exchange rates will result in foreign exchange gains and losses on these foreign currency assets and liabilities and are included in other income net our objective in managing foreign exchange activity is to preserve stockholder value by minimizing the risk of foreign currency exchange rate changes our strategy is to primarily utilize forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures under our program gains and losses in our foreign currency exposures are offset by losses and gains on our forward contracts our forward contracts generally have terms of one to six months at the end of the reporting period open contracts are markedtomarket with unrealized gains and losses included in other income net 

 

the following table presents a sensitivity analysis on our foreign forward exchange contract portfolio using a statistical model to estimate the potential gain or loss in fair value that could arise from hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of foreign currency  in millions  

 

 

 

equity price risk 

 

in june 2006 we issued 11 billion principal amount of 075 convertible senior notes due 2011 and 10 billion of 100 convertible senior notes due 2013 holders may convert their senior notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances upon conversion we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of symantec common stock up to the principal amount of the note amounts in excess of the principal amount if any may be paid in cash or in stock at our option concurrent with the issuance of the senior notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and separately warrant transactions to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the senior notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock 

 

for business and strategic purposes we also hold equity interests in several privately held companies many of which can be considered to be in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky and we could lose a substantial part or our entire investment in these companies these investments are recorded at cost and 

classified as other longterm assets in the consolidated balance sheets as of april 2 2010 these investments had an aggregate carrying value of 22 million

the sec defines the term “disclosure controls and procedures” to mean a company’s controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms “disclosure controls and procedures” include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have concluded based on an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the exchange act by our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and our 

chief financial officer that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report 

 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f of the exchange act for symantec our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of april 2 2010 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

 

our management has concluded that as of april 2 2010 our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on these criteria 

 

the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report regarding its assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of april 2 2010 which is included in part iv item 15 of this annual report 

 

  

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended april 2 2010 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within our company have been detected

we provide electricity and energy services to wholesale and retail customers through two business segments 

 

  

as discussed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations—business overview and—2008 significant events” in item 7 of this form 10k we are exploring a full range of possible strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value including among other possibilities the sale of all or substantially all of reliant energy as well as the sale of some or all of our retail business we are exiting the ci portion of our retail energy business either through a wind down or sale of our ci contracts in late 2008 we sold all of our pjm market excluding illinois and new york collectively referred to as northeast ci contracts 

 

sale of our texas retail business on february 28 2009 we entered into several agreements related to the sale of our texas retail business we entered into a purchase agreement to sell our interests in the affiliates that operate our texas retail mass and ci business to a subsidiary the buyer of nrg energy inc nrg for 2875 million in cash plus the value of the net working capital this sale includes the rights to our name nrg has guaranteed the obligations of the buyer upon closing our affiliates that are party to the credit sleeve and reimbursement agreement with merrill lynch will be owned by the buyer we have agreed to pay merrill lynch a 75 million fee and to increase the fees under the credit sleeve and reimbursement agreement by 3 million per month until the close the bulk of the fees payable to merrill lynch are payable only upon and at closing when the sale closes the litigation with merrill lynch against our affiliates that conduct our retail business related to the termination of the working capital facility supporting our retail business will be dismissed we and merrill lynch have agreed to stay further proceedings in the litigation until june 1 2009 or in the event regulatory approvals delay closing july 1 2009 the sale is subject to customary closing conditions including the hartscottrodino review the buyer may terminate the agreement in connection with certain takeover proposals that it may receive prior to closing subject to the payment of a 45 million termination fee we expect to close in the second quarter of 2009 we will enter a oneyear transition services agreement with the buyer in connection with the closing which will include terms and conditions for information technology services accounting services and human resources nrg’s guarantee will also apply to this transition services agreement as required by our debt agreements a par exchange offer will be made with the net proceeds to holders of our secured notes and pedfa bonds

wholesale energy 

 

as of december 31 2008 we owned had an interest in or leased 36 operating electric power generation facilities with an aggregate net generating capacity of 14580 mw in five regions of the united states the net generating capacity of these facilities consists of approximately 38 baseload 37 intermediate and 25 peaking capacity 

we sell electricity and energy services from our generation portfolio in hourahead dayahead and forward markets in bilateral and iso markets we sell these products to investorowned utilities municipalities cooperatives and other companies that serve end users or purchase power at wholesale for resale for our power generation we obtain transmission and distribution services from various rtos isos utilities and municipalities because our facilities are not subject to traditional costbased regulation we can generally sell electricity at marketdetermined prices the following table identifies the principal markets where we own lease or have under contract wholesale generation assets 

 

 

 

through the pjm market’s reliability pricing model auctions we have committed approximately 6400 mw of capacity through the planning year ending may 2012 we expect that a substantial portion of our capacity that clears a pjm auction will continue to be committed to the pjm market up to three years in advance revenue from these capacity sales is determined by market rules designed to ensure regional reliability encourage competition and reduce price volatility the california public utility commission and cal iso are considering possible enhancements to existing resource adequacy requirements including alternatives similar to capacity markets designed in new england and pjm 

 

to ensure adequate fuel supplies we contract for natural gas coal and fuel oil for our generation facilities for our natural gasfired plants we also arrange for schedule and balance natural gas from our suppliers and through transporting pipelines to perform these functions we lease natural gas transportation and storage capacity 

 

in february 2006 we completed an evaluation of our wholesale energy segment’s hedging strategy and use of capital as a result of our evaluation we substantially reduced hedging activity see “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in item 7a of this form 10k and notes 2f and 5 to our consolidated financial statements

retail energy 

 

as a retail electricity provider we arrange for the transmission and delivery of electricity to our customers bill customers collect payment for electricity sold and maintain call centers to provide customer service we purchase the electricity we sell to customers from generation companies utilities and power marketers and other retail energy companies in the wholesale market we obtain our transmission and distribution services in texas from entities regulated by the puct and ercot 

 

our retail business for residential and small business customers is in texas based on metered locations as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 15 million residential and 150000 small business customers making us the second largest mass market electricity provider in texas approximately 65 of our texas customers are in the houston area we also have customers in other parts of texas including the dallas ft worth and corpus christi areas 

 

we market electricity and energy services to ci customers in texas and until the end of 2008 the northeast these customers include refineries chemical plants manufacturing facilities hospitals universities governmental agencies restaurants and other facilities in connection with our intention to unwind our creditenhanced retail structure with merrill lynch and to reduce our future collateral posting obligations we decided to exit the ci portion of our retail business over time except where we are contractually obligated to do so 

we are no longer entering into contracts with new ci customers and we do not expect to renew contracts with our current customers we sold all of our northeast ci contracts and are actively seeking to sell our illinois ci contracts for discussion of our agreement to sell our texas retail business see “— general”

regulation 

 

texas 

 

we are certified by the puct to sell electricity to retail customers in texas effective january 1 2007 we began selling electricity in the competitive areas of ercot to customers at unregulated prices our activities in texas are subject to standards and regulations adopted by the puct and ercot see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k 

 

until january 1 2007 we were required to make electricity available to houston area residential and small business customers at the puctapproved “pricetobeat” any residential “pricetobeat” customers who did not select an alternative product by december 31 2006 continued being served under our residential services plan 

other states 

 

we are licensed in several states outside ercot to supply ci customers as a result of our decision to exit the ci portion of our retail business over time and the sale of our northeast ci contracts in 2009 we will have ci customers only in texas and illinois our ci retail activities in illinois are subject to standards and regulations adopted by pjm and the illinois commerce commission 

 

we operate electric generation facilities in regions administered by pjm cal iso and miso these isos operate under fercapproved market rules the market rules include price limits or caps applicable to all generators and numerous other fercapproved requirements relative to the manner in which we must operate our generating facilities 

 

federal energy regulatory commission 

 

a number of our subsidiaries are public utilities under the federal power act and are subject to ferc rules and oversight regulations as public utilities these subsidiaries sell power at either marketbased rates if ferc has granted marketbased rate authority or costbased rates each of these subsidiaries has been granted marketbased rate authority although a limited number of services sold by some of them is sold at costbased rates 

 

competition and seasonality 

 

the retail and wholesale energy industries are intensely competitive our competitors include merchant energy companies utilities retail electric service providers and other companies including in recent years companies owned by investment banking firms hedge funds and private equity funds our principal competitors in the retail electricity markets outside of houston are typically incumbent retail electric providers which have the advantage of longstanding relationships with customers in general competition in the retail energy markets is on the basis of price service brand image product offerings and market perceptions of creditworthiness and competition in the wholesale energy markets is on the basis of price service and market perceptions of creditworthiness for additional information on the effect of competition and for a discussion of how seasonality impacts our business see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k and note 17 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

environmental matters 

 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local requirements relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of personnel and the public these requirements relate to a broad range of our activities including the discharge of compounds into the air water and soil the proper handling of solid hazardous and toxic materials and waste noise and safety and health standards applicable to the workplace 

 

based on existing regulations our market outlook and our current assessment of the costs of labor and materials and the state of evolving technologies we estimate that we will invest approximately 123 million in 2009 27 to 52 million in 2010 and 28 million to 306 million in 2011 through 2014 on projects to reduce our emission levels and lessen the environmental impact of our operations these amounts include 45 million for future ash landfill expansions from 2009 through 2014 as described below a significant amount of these expenditures relate to our election to upgrade the so 2 emissions controls at some of our facilities 

 

in some cases which are described below environmental laws and regulations are pending are under consideration are in dispute or could be revised unless otherwise noted we cannot predict the outcome or ultimate effect of these matters on our business for additional information on how environmental matters may impact our business including a january 2009 notice of violation from the epa regarding new source review see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k and note 13c to our consolidated financial statements 

air quality 

 

under the clean air act the epa has implemented a number of emission control programs that affect industrial sources including power plants by limiting emissions of nitrogen oxides no x  and sulfur dioxide so 2  no x and so 2 are precursors to the formation of acid rain fine particulate matter and regional haze no x is also a precursor to the formation of ozone 

 

no x and so 2 emissions 

 

in march 2005 the epa finalized the clean air interstate rule cair to further reduce emissions of no x and so 2 in the eastern united states in two phases the first phase which takes effect in 2009 for no x and 2010 for so 2  requires overall reductions within the area of approximately 50 in no x and so 2 emissions on an annual basis the second phase which takes effect in 2015 requires additional reductions of approximately 10 for a 60 total reduction in no x and approximately 15 for a 65 reduction in so 2  the epa regulations include the use of capandtrade programs to achieve these reductions these regulations require us to provide an allowance for each ton of no x and so 2 that we emit under a capandtrade program we maintain emission allowances that at a minimum correspond with forward power sales in general we do not have emission allowances for all of our generation we purchase emission allowances as needed to correspond with our generation of electricity 

 

in july 2008 the district of columbia circuit court of appeals ruled that cair was legally flawed vacated cair in its entirety and remanded cair to the epa for revision of cair consistent with the court’s opinion on rehearing in december 2008 the court decided that cair will remain in effect pending epa’s modification to cure the defects identified by the court the court’s most recent decision will reinstate cair’s proposed annual allowancebased no x program beginning in 2009 and the increased surrender rate for so 2 allowances beginning in 2010 the existing ozone season no x program and the so 2 allowance requirements under the clean air act’s acid rain program will continue to be in force 

 

we have undertaken studies to evaluate possible impacts of cair and similar legislative and regulatory proposals which will primarily affect our coalfired facilities in the eastern united states based on an economic analysis that includes plant operability changes in the emission allowances market potential impact of stateimposed regulations and our estimates at this time of capital expenditures we have elected to invest 64 million in 2009 and up to an estimated 304 million in 2010 through 2013 to principally reduce our emissions of so 2  

 

mercury emissions 

 

in december 2000 the epa found that regulation of mercury emissions from power plants is “appropriate and necessary” triggering the requirement to regulate such emissions using the maximum achievable control technology standard mact of the clean air act however the epa pursued an alternate marketbased approach for regulating mercury emissions from power plants known as the clean air mercury rule camr in february 2008 the dc circuit court of appeals struck down camr the epa appealed but in february 2009 it withdrew the appeal and stated its intent to proceed with rulemaking under the mact standard this approach considers the most effective control technologies in operation without regard to cost effectiveness despite the epa’s statement of regulatory intent there are multiple legal actions pending with respect to regulation of mercury from power plants 

 

while the epa was pursuing camr a number of states including pennsylvania pursued mercury regulations that were more stringent than camr the pennsylvania rule generally requires mercury reductions on a facility basis in two phases with 80 reductions in 2010 and 90 reductions in 2015 this rule is the subject of current litigation and a state court declared pennsylvania’s rule unlawful in january 2009 

 

our capital investment plan is based on compliance with the pennsylvania rule our estimate of capital expenditures to comply primarily with the first phase of pennsylvania’s mercury control program is 49 million in 2009 however we are continuing to evaluate our plan given that regulation of mercury from power plants at both federal and state levels is uncertain 

air particulates 

 

in september 2006 the epa issued revised national ambient air quality standards for fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 25 microns or pm25 in december 2008 the epa identified geographic areas that are not in compliance with the revised standard nonattainment areas ten of our 11 coalfired power generation facilities are located in nonattainment areas states must develop emission reduction plans by april 2012 that bring nonattainment areas into compliance by 2014 these plans may be statespecific or regional in scope the epa has estimated that the power generation sector so 2 and no x emissions reductions required by cair will allow many of the nonattainment areas to achieve compliance with the revised pm25 standard however states are not precluded from developing plans that would require further reductions in no x and so 2 emissions 

 

greenhouse gas emissions 

 

there is an increased focus within the united states over the direction of domestic climate change policy several states in the northeast midwest and west are increasingly active in developing statespecific or regional regulatory initiatives to stimulate co 2 emission reductions in the electric power generation industry and other industries the united states congress is considering legislation that would impose mandatory limitation of co 2 and other greenhouse gas emissions for the domestic power generation sector the specific impact on our business will depend upon the form of emissionsrelated legislation or regulations ultimately adopted by the federal government or states in which our facilities are located 

 

ten northeastern states including new jersey and maryland have formed the regional greenhouse gas initiative or rggi which requires power generators to reduce co 2 emissions by ten percent by 2019 beginning in 2009 california adopted legislation designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 25 below 1990 levels by 2020 beginning in 2012 in july 2008 the pennsylvania climate change act was adopted this legislation requires development of reports of the impacts of climate change in pennsylvania and potential economic opportunities resulting from mitigation strategies it also requires development of an annual greenhouse gas emissions inventory and establishment of costeffective strategies for reducing or offsetting greenhouse gases 

 

in addition the epa has announced plans to consider regulations to address co 2 emissions as part of the clean air act’s new source review program individual states may also begin to take into account co 2 emissions when considering permits to construct or modify significant sources of emissions 

 

in september 2007 we joined the chicago climate exchange a voluntary greenhouse gas registry reduction and trading system by joining the exchange we have committed to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to six percent below the average of our 19982001 levels by 2010 we expect to satisfy our reduction targets through previously implemented unit retirements and capacity factor reductions ongoing heat rate improvement efforts and transacting on the exchange 

 

water quality 

 

in july 2007 the epa suspended its 2004 regulations relating to cooling water intake structures at large existing power plants pending further rulemaking this action was in response to the second circuit court of appeals’ january 2007 remand of the 2004 regulations the epa retained interim requirements that plant intakes employ best technology available controls as determined on a plantbyplant best professional judgment basis the supreme court is reviewing the second circuit’s decision and is expected to rule in 2009 

 

other 

 

as a result of their age many of our facilities contain significant amounts of asbestos insulation other asbestos containing materials as well as leadbased paint existing state and federal rules require the proper management and disposal of these potentially toxic materials we believe we properly manage and dispose of such materials in compliance with these state and federal rules see note 13c to our consolidated financial statements 

we do not believe we have any material liabilities or obligations under the comprehensive environmental response corporation and liability act of 1980 or similar state laws these laws impose clean up and restoration liability on owners and operators of facilities from or at which there has been a release or threatened release of hazardous substances together with those who have transported or arranged for the disposal of those substances 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2008 we had 3816 fulltime and parttime employees of these employees 1125 are covered by collective bargaining agreements which expire on various dates from march 31 2009 through october 31 2013 the following table sets forth the number of our employees as of december 31 2008

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

risks related to the wholesale and retail energy businesses 

 

the financial results of our wholesale and retail energy segments are subject to market risks beyond our control 

 

our results of operations financial condition and cash flows are significantly impacted by the prevailing demand and market prices for electricity purchased power fuel and emission allowances over which we have no control market prices can fluctuate dramatically in response to many factors including weather conditions changes in the prices of related commodities changes in law and regulation regulatory intervention including the imposition of price limitations bidding rules or similar mechanisms market illiquidity transmission constraints environmental limitations generation unit outages fuel supply issues national and worldwide economic conditions and other events current national and worldwide conditions may result in ongoing reduced demand for electricity commodity price volatility changes in law or regulation and other events 

 

the markets in which we operate are relatively immature markets that are characterized by elements of both deregulated and regulated markets changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate could adversely affect our ability to set rates or the cost manner or feasibility of conducting our business 

 

we operate in a regulatory environment that is undergoing varying restructuring initiatives in many instances the regulatory structures governing the electricity markets are still evolving creating gaps in the regulatory framework and associated uncertainty in addition existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to our facilities or our commercial activities we cannot predict the future direction of these initiatives or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on our business consequently future regulatory restrictions regulatory or political intervention or changes in laws and regulations may constrain our ability to set rates at market prices or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business see “business—regulation” in item 1 of this form 10k 

 

the tightening of the supply and demand balance for electricity may result in significant long and shortterm price volatility in both our wholesale and retail businesses price volatility may result in legislative regulatory or judicial initiatives intended to mitigate the impact of such volatility 

 

the permitting and construction of new generation facilities is a lengthy process additionally the progressive tightening of environmental regulatory requirements and their reflection in permits and regulations may result in generation facilities being removed from service prior to their end of useful life or derated permanently or temporarily as a result there may be periods when the supply of electricity is reduced or constrained relative to the demand for electricity during these periods the wholesale price and retail price of electricity may increase significantly in response to this legislators regulators consumers and others may seek legislative regulatory or judicial relief in an attempt to control or limit the wholesale price andor the retail price of electricity 

we depend on sources facilities and systems that we do not own or control for our fuel and fuel supply and to deliver electricity to and bill our customers any disruption in these sources facilities or systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

 

we depend on fuel sources and fuel supply facilities owned and operated by third parties to supply our generation plants we depend on power transmission and distribution facilities and metering systems owned and operated by third parties to deliver electricity to our customers and provide energy usage data if these sources facilities or systems fail are disrupted or become unavailable to us we may be unable to generate andor provide electricity our cost of doing so may significantly increase andor we may be subject to contractual or other penalties in addition inaccurate or untimely information from third parties could hinder our ability to bill customers and collect amounts owed we also participate in regional power pools reliability councils and transmission organizations and changes in the rules governing such groups andor in the composition of such groups may have an adverse effect on our business participation in rtos is voluntary and transmission owning companies may exit an rto so long as they do so in compliance with the applicable ferc tariffs and agreements and ferc approval 

 

the operation of generation facilities involves significant risks that could interrupt operations and increase our costs 

 

ownership of generation assets exposes us to risks relating to the breakdown of equipment or processes fuel supply or transportation interruptions construction delays or cost overruns shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment material and labor operational restrictions resulting from environmental limitations and governmental interventions as well as other risks in addition many of our facilities are old and require significant maintenance expenditures we are party to collective bargaining agreements with labor unions at several of our plants if our workers were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown other employees were to become unionized or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated we could experience a significant disruption in our operations and higher ongoing labor costs similarly we have an aging workforce at a number of our plants creating potential knowledge and expertise gaps as those workers retire if we are unable to secure fuel we will not be able to run our generation units construction delays could cause extended andor unplanned outages of our generation facilities if a generation unit fails or is unavailable we may have to purchase replacement power from third parties at higher prices we have insurance subject to limits and deductibles covering some types of physical damage and business interruption related to our generation units however this insurance may not always be available on commercially reasonable terms in addition there is no assurance that insurance proceeds will be sufficient to cover all losses insurance payments will be timely made or the policies themselves will be free of substantial deductibles 

 

our business operations expose us to the risk of loss if third parties fail to perform their contractual obligations 

 

we may incur losses if third parties default on their contractual obligations such as obligations to pay us money buy or sell electricity fuel emission allowances and other commodities or provide us with fuel transportation services power transmission or distribution services for additional information about third party default risk including our efforts to mitigate against this risk see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—credit risk” in item 7 of this form 10k and note 2g to our consolidated financial statements 

 

our costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant and can affect our future financial results 

 

our wholesale energy business is subject to extensive and evolving environmental regulations particularly our coal and oilfired generation facilities we incur significant costs in complying with these regulations and if we fail to comply could incur significant penalties our cost estimates for compliance with environmental regulations are based on our current assessment of the cost of labor and materials and the state of evolving technologies changes to the preceding factors revisions of environmental regulations litigation and new 

legislation andor regulations including new climate change legislation and regulations as well as other factors could cause our actual costs to vary outside the range of our estimates in addition failure to comply with environmental requirements could require us to shut down or reduce production on our generation facilities or create liability exposure new environmental laws or regulations may be adopted that would further constrain our operations or increase our environmental compliance costs we also may be responsible for the environmental liabilities associated with generation facilities even if a prior owner caused the liabilities we are required to surrender emission allowances equal to emissions of specific substances to operate our facilities surrender requirements may require purchase of allowances which may be unavailable or only available at costs that would make it uneconomical to operate our generating assets see “business—environmental matters” in item 1 of this form 10k and note 13c to our consolidated financial statements 

 

failure to obtain or maintain any required permits or approvals could prevent or limit us from operating our business 

 

to operate our generating facilities and retail electric business we must obtain and maintain various permits licenses approvals and certificates from governmental agencies in some jurisdictions we must also meet minimum requirements for customer service and comply with local consumer protection and other laws our failure to obtain or maintain any necessary governmental permits or licenses or to satisfy these legal requirements including environmental compliance provisions could limit our ability to operate our business or create liability exposure 

 

we could be liable for a share of the payment defaults of other market participants 

 

if a market participant defaults on its payment obligations to an iso we together with other market participants are liable for a portion of the default obligation that is not otherwise covered by the defaulting market participant each iso establishes credit requirements applicable to market participants and the basis for allocating payment default amounts to market participants in ercot the allocation is based on share of the total load as of december 31 2008 we would have been liable for approximately 21 of any defaulted amount in ercot in pjm miso and cal iso the methods of allocating the share of defaults differ and our exposure from these markets is currently relatively small 

 

significant events beyond our control such as hurricanes and other weatherrelated problems or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

the uncertainty associated with events beyond our control such as significant weather events and the risk of future terrorist activity may affect our results of operations and financial condition in unpredictable ways these events could result in adverse changes in the insurance markets and disruptions of power and fuel markets in addition significant weather events or terrorist actions could damage or shut down our generation facilities or the fuel and fuel supply facilities or the power transmission and distribution facilities upon which our generation and retail businesses are dependent power supply may be sold at a loss if these events cause a significant loss of retail customer load we do not have business interruption insurance related to our retail energy business these events could also adversely affect the united states economy create instability in the financial markets and as a result have an adverse effect on our ability to access capital on terms and conditions acceptable to us 

 

risks relating to our retail business 

 

merrill lynch credit support provider for our retail business contends we have violated the terms of the credit support agreement 

 

under the terms of our creditenhanced retail structure entered into in december 2006 merrill lynch provides guarantees and posts collateral for the supply purchases and related transactions of our retail energy business merrill lynch contends that we violated the credit sleeve and reimbursement agreement the agreement when we terminated our working capital facility with them in december 2008 and has filed an 

action in a new york court seeking a judgment declaring an event of default under the agreement if merrill lynch is successful with its claim it could seek to exercise remedies under the agreement there is a range of possible remedies available to merrill lynch under the agreement including without limitation 

 

  

depending on the specific remedy that merrill lynch may elect to pursue cross defaults could occur under our june 2007 credit facilities although we would seek a waiver from the lenders to avoid any cross defaults such waiver may not be available on commercially reasonable terms and we may choose to terminate the june 2007 credit facilities if we were to do so we may be required to post cash for outstanding letters of credit for these credit facilities as of december 31 2008 we have 0 outstanding in debt 296 million outstanding as letters of credit and 454 million as available liquidity there are a number of events including nonpayments of obligations and a noninvestmentgrade credit rating that could cause merrill lynch to default under our creditenhanced retail structure furthermore if merrill lynch experiences downgrades in its credit rating or credit outlook our suppliers may require other credit support or cease doing business with us pursuant to the creditenhanced retail structure if any of these events occurs our ability to operate our retail business could be impaired and our liquidity cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” in item 7 of this form 10k and notes 7 and 13b to our consolidated financial statements 

 

we may have to post significant amounts of collateral which could adversely affect our liquidity financial position and business 

 

in connection with any unwind of our creditenhanced retail structure with merrill lynch we will have to post collateral for new retail supply and hedging transactions our levels of collateral postings would be determined and impacted by the terms and timing of the unwind the nature and volume of our commodity hedging agreements commodity prices and other strategic alternatives that we may undertake depending on the specific timing and the movement in underlying commodity prices we could incur significant collateral posting obligations that may require us to seek additional sources of liquidity including additional debt the covenants in our credit agreements and our agreement with merrill lynch restrict our ability to among other things obtain additional financing if we were unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or raise cash from other sources we may not be able to meet our collateral posting obligations these situations could result from further adverse developments in the energy fuel or capital markets a disruption in our operations or those of third parties or other events adversely affecting our cash flows and financial performance we cannot make any assurances that we would be able to obtain such additional liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

 

volatile power supply costs and demand for power could adversely affect the financial performance of our retail business 

 

we purchase substantially all of our supply requirements from third parties as a result our financial performance depends on our ability to obtain adequate supplies of electric generation from third parties at prices below the prices we charge our customers our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in any period in which our power supply costs rise at a greater rate than our rates charged to customers the price of our power supply purchases associated with our energy commitments can be different than that reflected in the rates charged to customers due to among other factors 

 

 14 

 

  

our earnings and cash flows could also be adversely affected in any period in which the demand for power significantly varies from our forecasted supply which could occur due to among other factors weather events competition and economic conditions 

 

we may lose further market share in the houston retail electricity market 

 

in recent years we have experienced declines in our share of the houston retail electricity market which represents approximately 65 of our residential and small business customer base this trend could continue the new competitive market has attracted a number of new participants competitors are putting downward pressure on our houston sales volumes and may put downward pressure on our margins over time see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—business overview” in item 7 of this form 10k 

 

violations of market power standards may negatively impact the wholesale cost of power 

 

in 2006 the puct implemented a new rule on resource adequacy and market power in the ercot region in this rule the puct increased the current price cap applicable to generation offers into the ercot energy market eliminated current market power mitigation measures and adopted new market power standards if a market participant violates the market power standards and it is not adequately mitigated such violation could have the impact of increasing the wholesale cost of power which could adversely impact our gross margins in the texas retail market 

 

we depend on the isos to communicate operating and system information in a timely and accurate manner information that is not accurate or timely can have an impact on our current and future reported financial results 

 

each iso communicates information relating to a customer’s choice of retail electric provider and other data needed for servicing of customer accounts to utilities and retail electric providers any failure to perform these tasks will result in delays and other problems in enrolling switching and billing customers some of the isos are also responsible for settling all electricity supply volumes in their region information that is not accurate or timely may result in incorrect estimates of our settled volumes and supply costs that would need to be corrected when such information is received see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—new accounting pronouncements significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates—critical accounting estimates” in item 7 of this form 10k 

 

risks related to our company 

 

our borrowing levels debt service obligations and restrictive covenants may adversely affect our business we may be vulnerable to reductions in our cash flow 

 

as of december 31 2008 we had total debt of 29 billion 

 

 15 

 

  

if we were unable to generate sufficient cash flows access funds from operations or raise cash from other sources we would not be able to meet our debt service and other obligations these situations could result from adverse developments in the energy fuel or capital markets a disruption in our operations or those of third parties or other events adversely affecting our cash flows and financial performance see further discussion of risks related to our creditenhanced retail structure under “risks related to our retail business” 

 

our hedging and other risk management activities may not work as planned 

 

our hedges may not be effective as a result of basis price differences transmission issues price correlation volume variations or other factors including margins being compressed as a result of market prices behaving differently than expected see “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in item 7a of this form 10k 

 

changes in the wholesale energy market or changes in our evaluation of generation assets could result in impairments 

 

if our outlook for the wholesale energy market changes negatively or if our ongoing evaluation of our wholesale energy segment results in decisions to mothball retire or dispose of generation assets we could have impairment charges related to our fixed assets see note 2i to our consolidated financial statements 

 

lawsuits regulatory proceedings and tax proceedings could adversely affect our future financial results 

 

from time to time we are named as a party to or our property is the subject of lawsuits regulatory proceedings or tax proceedings these proceedings involve highly subjective matters with complex factual and legal questions their outcome is uncertain any claim that is successfully asserted against us could result in significant damage claims and other losses even if we prevail any proceedings could be costly and timeconsuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows see notes 11 13 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

we have entered into outsourcing arrangements with third party service providers in addition our operations are highly dependent on computer and other operating systems including telecommunications systems any interruptions in these arrangements or systems could significantly disrupt our business operations 

 

in recent years we have entered into outsourcing arrangements such as information technology production software infrastructure and development and certain functions within customer operations with third party service providers if these service providers do not perform their obligations we may incur significant costs and experience interruptions in our business operations in connection with switching to other service providers or assuming these obligations ourselves we are also highly dependent on our specialized computer and communications systems the operation of which could be interrupted by fire flood power loss computer viruses or similar disruptions there is no guarantee that our backup systems and disaster recovery plans will be effective 

if we acquire or develop additional generation assets or dispose of existing generation assets we may incur additional costs and risks 

 

we may seek to purchase or develop additional generation facilities or dispose of existing generation facilities there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful in any sale we may be required to indemnify a purchaser against liabilities to finance future acquisitions we may be required to issue additional equity securities or incur additional debt we cannot make any assurances that we would be able to obtain such additional liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

 

our process of exploring strategic alternatives may not be successful 

 

on october 6 2008 we announced that our board of directors authorized the exploration of strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value there can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in a transaction or that the benefits of any strategic alternative pursued will in fact be realized the pendency of this process may create uncertainties with current and potential customers employees suppliers and business partners in addition the market price of our stock may be volatile as we explore strategic alternatives and volatility may persist or be increased if and when a decision to pursue an alternative is announced or we announce that we are no longer exploring strategic alternatives

business overview 

 

financial flexibility given the ongoing turmoil in the financial markets and the uncertainty in the overall economic outlook our focus has been and continues to be on our liquidity and financial flexibility we are regularly assessing the impact on our business of a wide variety of economic and commodity price scenarios we believe we have the ability to operate through a significant downturn 

 

review of strategic alternatives in october 2008 our board of directors initiated a process to review strategic alternatives and formed a special committee to oversee this process we are exploring a full range of possible strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value including among other possibilities the sale of all or substantially all of reliant energy as well as the sale of some or all of our retail business for discussion of our agreement to sell our texas retail business see “business—general” in item 1 of this form 10k 

 

ongoing operations our objective is to be a leader in delivering the benefits of competitive electricity markets to customers our business focuses on the competitive mass retail and wholesale electricity markets we are committed to delivering superior returns from competitive markets through insights into the fundamentals of our core markets and a commitment to riskweighted investments whose return on invested capital exceeds our weightedaverage cost of capital 

 

companywide we are focusing on the following valuecreation levers

we also believe that stockholder value is enhanced through the development of a highly motivated and customerfocused work force we continue to focus on 

 

  

wholesale energy the wholesale energy segment is a capitalintensive cyclical business earnings are significantly impacted by spark and dark spreads and capacity prices our margins are driven by a number of factors including the prices of power natural gas coal and fuel oil the cost of emissions transmission weather and global macroeconomic factors none of which we control and many of which are volatile the factor that we have the most control over is the percentage of time that our generating assets are available to run when it is economical for them to do so commercial capacity factor the key earnings drivers in the wholesale energy segment are the amount of time our power plants are economical to operate economic generation and commercial capacity factor which both determine the amount of electricity we generate the margin we earn for each unit of electricity sold the availability of our generating assets to meet demand and capacity revenues other margin and operating costs these earnings drivers are impacted by various factors including 

 

economic generation 

 

  

commercial capacity factor 

 

  

unit margin

retail energy the retail energy segment is an electricity resale business we earn a margin by selling electricity to enduser customers meeting the service needs of such customers and acquiring supply for the estimated demand the key earnings drivers in the retail energy segment are the volume of electricity we sell to customers the unit margins received on those sales and the cost of acquiring and serving those customers operating costs these earnings drivers are impacted by various factors including 

 

volume of electricity sales 

 

  

unit margins 

 

  

  

  

operating costs 

 

  

we are focusing on the following valuecreation levers

to reduce the risk of extreme earnings variability in our retail energy segment we have designed and are implementing changes in our hedging approach such as matching supply and load by geographic zone buying heat rate and fixedprice call options for volumes significantly above expected levels and considering the use of gas power and weather options to mitigate extreme events these changes will result in higher expected supply costs over time we are reviewing our core processes that support the business to ensure that we have the right people skills and systems 

 

for a discussion of our ongoing plan to exit the ci portion of our retail business over time and the related reduction in our longterm capital requirements for collateral see “—2008 significant events” and “—liquidity and capital resources” below 

 

our ability to achieve these objectives and execute these actions is subject to a number of factors some of which we may not be able to control see “cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information” and “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k 

 

2008 significant events 

 

ercot the houston area experienced thirtyyear record heat in late may and early june 2008 as a result load demand in houston and south texas was greater than we expected additionally transmission constraints limited the ability to move power into the houston and south texas zones which caused some of our power supply to be unavailable to meet expected demand in response we purchased power in houston and south texas to meet our increased load at market prices this extraordinary event negatively impacted our retail contribution margin by approximately 150 million during primarily the second quarter of 2008 

 

hurricane ike stranded supply costs in september 2008 hurricane ike struck the upper texas coast which left over 21 million electric consumers more than 90 percent of the metered electric consumers in the houstongalveston area without power more than 10 million electric consumers were without power for at least six days and more than 500000 customers remained without power ten days after the storm retail contribution margin was negatively impacted by approximately 75 million as a result of the effects of hurricane ike including reduced sales volumes and the sale of excess supply at a loss 

 

hurricane ike higher supply costs and pricing decisions due to a substantial increase in natural gas prices we incurred much higher supply costs in the second and third quarters of 2008 compared to 2007 natural gas prices declined rapidly in the third quarter and after hurricane ike we decided to not take pricing actions that would have immediately and fully offset the higher supply costs at that time the combination of increased supply costs and the associated pricing decisions lowered 2008 retail contribution margin by approximately 250 million 

 

merrill lynch the results in our retail energy segment in 2008 were substantially below our expectations as a result of a variety of factors including the record heat in the houston area and ercot transmission constraints experienced in late may and early june the devastating impact of hurricane ike on the gulf coast and the significant volatility in commodity prices experienced in 2008 as a consequence we concluded that terminating our 300 million retail working capital facility agreement with merrill lynch would be appropriate in order to address any issue that might be asserted regarding the minimum adjusted retail ebitda covenant in that facility in december 2008 we terminated the working capital facility and merrill lynch contends that we did not have this right see further discussion of merrill lynch’s claim and related legal actions in “—liquidity and capital resources” below and note 13b to our consolidated financial statements 

 

exit from ci portion of our retail business prior to our decision to exit the ci portion of our retail energy business either through a wind down or sale of our ci contracts roughly 70 of our retail collateral posting obligations were associated with ci in contrast ci represented only approximately 30 of the contribution margin associated with our retail business without the merrill lynch credit support under the credit sleeve and reimbursement agreement we do not believe that the ci margins covered our cost of capital associated with this business as a result we decided to exit the ci portion of our retail business except where we are contractually obligated to do so we are no longer entering into contracts with new ci customers and we do not expect to renew contracts with our current customers in december 2008 we sold all 

of our northeast ci contracts the northeast ci activity was a 505 million of our consolidated revenues or 4 and b 18 million of our consolidated gross margin excluding unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives or 1 during 2008 we expect that approximately 13000 mw 36 7000 mw 19 and 15000 mw 45 of our remaining contracted volumes for the ci activity will roll off during 2009 2010 and thereafter respectively 

 

the following details the ci activity in our consolidated results of operations 

 

 

 

 

  

disposition of generation facilities in july 2008 channelview completed the sale of its plant for 500 million in october 2008 we sold our bighorn plant for 500 million see notes 19 and 20 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

consolidated results of operations 

 

the following discussion includes nongaap financial measures which are not standardized therefore it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names these nongaap financial measures which are discussed below reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed with our gaap results may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business segments investors should review our consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure 

 

2008 compared to 2007 and 2007 compared to 2006 

 

we reported 740 million consolidated net loss or 213 loss per share for 2008 compared to 365 million consolidated net income or 104 diluted income per share for 2007 and 328 million consolidated net loss or 107 loss per share for 2006 

 

 

 

 

  

wholesale energy segment 

 

in analyzing the results of our wholesale energy segment and in communications with investors analysts rating agencies banks and other parties we use the nongaap financial measures “open energy gross margin” “open wholesale gross margin” and “open wholesale contribution margin” which exclude the items described below as well as our wholesale energy segment profit and loss measure “contribution margin including wholesale hedges and unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives” open energy gross margin open wholesale gross margin and open wholesale contribution margin should not be relied upon without considering the gaap financial measures 

 

wholesale hedges we exclude the recurring effect of certain wholesale hedges that were entered into primarily to mitigate certain operational risks at our generation assets these amounts primarily relate to settlements of fuel hedges longterm natural gas transportation contracts and storage contracts we also exclude the effect of our wholesale energy segment’s 2008 sale of natural gas contracts to our retail energy segment we entered into this intersegment transaction to reduce merrill lynch’s collateral posting obligations the wholesale hedges described above are derived based on methodology consistent with the calculation of open energy gross margin we also exclude the recurring effect of certain historical wholesale hedges that were entered into in order to hedge the economics of a portion of our wholesale operations these amounts primarily relate to settlements of forward power hedges longterm tolling purchases longterm natural gas transportation contracts not serving our generation assets and our legacy energy trading we believe that it is 

useful to us investors analysts and others to show our results in the absence of hedges the impact of these hedges on our financial results is not a function of the operating performance of our generation assets and excluding the impact better reflects the operating performance of our generation assets based on prevailing market conditions we previously referred to these hedges as “historical and operational wholesale hedges” 

 

unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives we use derivative instruments to manage operational or market constraints and to increase the return on our generation assets we are required to record in our consolidated statement of operations noncash gainslosses related to future periods based on current changes in forward commodity prices for derivative instruments receiving marktomarket accounting treatment we refer to these gains and losses prior to settlement as well as ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges as “unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives” in some cases the underlying transactions being hedged receive accrual accounting treatment resulting in a mismatch of accounting treatments since the application of marktomarket accounting has the effect of pulling forward into current periods noncash gainslosses relating to and reversing in future delivery periods analysis of results of operations from one period to another can be difficult we believe that excluding these unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives provides a more meaningful representation of our economic performance in the reporting period and is therefore useful to us investors analysts and others in facilitating the analysis of our results of operations from one period to another these gainslosses are also not a function of the operating performance of our generation assets and excluding their impact helps isolate the operating performance of our generation assets under prevailing market conditions 

 

our wholesale energy segment’s contribution margin including wholesale hedges and unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives was 877 million in 2008 compared to 524 million in 2007 the 353 million increase was primarily due to reduced negative effect of wholesale hedges of 339 million partially offset by net change in unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives of 24 million open wholesale contribution margin increased 38 million primarily due to 48 million decrease in operation and maintenance expense partially offset by 8 million decrease in open wholesale gross margin our wholesale energy segment’s contribution margin including wholesale hedges and unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives was 524 million in 2007 compared to 146 million in 2006 the 378 million increase was primarily due to a reduced negative effect of wholesale hedges of 272 million partially offset by net change in unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives of 49 million open wholesale contribution margin increased 155 million primarily due to 196 million increase in open wholesale gross margin partially offset by 40 million increase in operation and maintenance expense see “—wholesale energy margins” below for explanations

retail energy segment 

 

in analyzing the results of our retail energy segment and in communications with investors analysts rating agencies banks and other parties we use the nongaap financial measures “retail gross margin” and “retail contribution margin” which exclude the items described below as well as our retail energy segment profit and loss measure “contribution margin including unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives and sale of northeast ci derivative liability” retail gross margin and retail contribution margin should not be relied upon without considering the gaap financial measures 

 

unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives we use derivative instruments to manage operational or market constraints and to execute our retail energy segment’s supply procurement strategy we are required to record in our consolidated statement of operations noncash gainslosses related to future periods based on current changes in forward commodity prices for derivative instruments receiving marktomarket accounting treatment we refer to these gains and losses prior to settlement as well as ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges as “unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives” in substantially all cases the underlying transactions being hedged receive accrual accounting treatment resulting in a mismatch of accounting treatments since the application of marktomarket accounting has the effect of pulling forward into current periods noncash gainslosses relating to and reversing in future delivery periods analysis of results of operations from one period to another can be difficult we believe that excluding these unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives provides a more meaningful representation of our economic performance in the reporting period and is therefore useful to us investors analysts and others in facilitating the analysis of our results of operations from one period to another 

 

sale of northeast ci derivative liability in december 2008 we sold our ci contracts in the northeast and recognized a gain of 63 million in connection with this sale we assigned contracts accounted for as derivatives that had a liability balance of 56 million at the time of the sale this 56 million liability represents the realized loss on the derivatives sold in the sale of northeast ci contracts we exclude this realized loss since it is more than offset by the gain on the sale of the sold contracts which is not included in retail gross margin or retail contribution margin when analyzing margins for our ongoing retail energy business management does not consider the effect of this 56 million realized loss we believe that excluding this item provides a more meaningful representation of our economic performance in the reporting period and is therefore useful to us investors analysts and others in facilitating the analysis of our results of operations from one period to another 

 

our retail energy segment’s contribution margin including unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives and sale of northeast ci derivative liability was 789 million in 2008 compared to 942 million in 2007 the 17 billion decrease was primarily due to the net change in unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives 

of 12 billion and a 501 million decrease in retail gross margin our retail energy segment’s contribution margin including unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives was 942 million in 2007 compared to 250 million in 2006 the 692 million increase was primarily due to the net change in unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives of 725 million partially offset by a 32 million decrease in retail gross margin see “—retail energy margins” below for explanations

liquidity and capital resources 

 

in addition to the factors discussed above under “—2008 significant events” the ongoing turmoil in the financial markets and uncertainty in the overall economic outlook have resulted in a significant increase in the cost and reduction in the availability of capital the impact of this turmoil and uncertainty has been to increase merrill lynch’s cost to perform under the creditenhanced retail structure to us the creditenhanced retail structure represents a significant concentration of credit risk with merrill lynch as a result of this and because of disagreements with merrill lynch regarding the minimum adjusted retail ebitda covenant in our working capital facility in september 2008 we decided to pursue an orderly unwind of the creditenhanced retail structure the amount of credit support that merrill lynch provides for our retail business varies depending on commodity prices and contracted volumes for our supply purchases as of january 1 2009 merrill lynch was providing credit support for our retail business that would represent collateral posting obligations for mass and ci of approximately 15 to 20 billion to ensure that we would have sufficient capital to operate our retail business without the benefit of the creditenhanced retail structure we secured commitments for 1 billion in new capital 

 

under the credit sleeve and reimbursement agreement the agreement we are not required to take on this full collateral posting obligation in november 2008 we made the decision to exit the ci portion of our retail energy business over time which will significantly reduce our longterm capital requirements for collateral and reached an agreement to sell our northeast ci contracts in connection with this decision we terminated the 1 billion in new capital commitments we incurred and expensed costs of 66 million during 2008 in connection with these commitments and other events related to our decision to unwind the creditenhanced retail structure 

 

in early december 2008 we exercised our right to terminate the merrill lynch 300 million retail working capital facility no borrowings were outstanding under this facility in late december 2008 merrill lynch filed a claim seeking a judgment declaring that under the agreement we did not have the right to terminate the working capital facility see note 13b to our consolidated financial statements 

 

if merrill lynch is successful with its claim it could seek to exercise remedies under the agreement there is a range of possible remedies available to merrill lynch under the agreement including without limitation 

 

 35 

 

however merrill lynch cannot require us to post collateral to replace its credit support for our existing business depending on the specific remedy that merrill lynch may elect to pursue cross defaults could occur under our june 2007 credit facilities in order to prevent any possible cross defaults we would seek a waiver of any default from these lenders if we were unable to obtain a waiver on commercially reasonable terms we would likely terminate these credit facilities this would result in a 750 million reduction of available liquidity a portion of which could take the form of posting cash for outstanding letters of credit for these credit facilities as of december 31 2008 we have 0 outstanding in debt 296 million outstanding as letters of credit and 454 million as available liquidity it is uncertain whether merrill lynch would exercise any of its remedies we do not believe any of these outcomes would have a material impact on the financial position results of operations or cash flows of our wholesale energy business 

 

merrill lynch stated in its december 2008 claim that reserving all its rights until further notice it intends to continue to perform under the creditenhanced retail structure and provide credit enhancement to us in connection with our retail energy business we intend to continue to pursue longerterm arrangements to unwind the creditenhanced retail structure 

 

in connection with any unwind we would expect to be obligated to post collateral for new retail supply and hedging transactions we estimate our capital requirements including contingent capital for the mass portion of our retail energy business to approximate 400 to 800 million in the aggregate once legacy transactions expire and all collateral posting obligations are borne by us these requirements include allowances for collateral posting obligations that fluctuate with the price of natural gas as decreases in the price of natural gas could cause increases in our collateral posting obligations for each one dollar movement in the price of natural gas we expect our collateral posting obligations to change by 100 to 150 million for the mass portion of our retail energy business we believe we would have sufficient liquidity to meet these capital requirements 

 

for discussion of our agreement to sell our texas retail business see “business—general” in item 1 of this form 10k 

 

sources of liquidity and capital resources 

 

our principal sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash and cash equivalents on hand cash flows from operations and unused borrowing capacity we expect these sources will be adequate to meet our expected liquidity needs in 2009 however if additional liquidity is required it could be sourced from borrowings net proceeds from asset sales or securities offerings we cannot make any assurances that we would be able to obtain such additional liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all also as discussed in notes 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements there are certain restrictive covenants and other contractual restrictions related to our ability to obtain additional borrowings 

 

as of february 13 2009 we had total available liquidity of 20 billion consisting of unused borrowing capacity letters of credit capacity and cash and cash equivalents this amount includes 192 million in cash and cash equivalents related to our retail business which could be restricted from time to time to use by that business during 2008 we generated 173 million in operating cash flows from continuing operations including the changes in margin deposits of 96 million cash outflow during 2008 we received 500 million in proceeds from the sale of our bighorn plant classified as investing cash flows we expect operating cash flows to increase in 2009 compared to 2008 

 

during the latter half of 2008 and continuing into 2009 the markets in which our wholesale generation assets operate have experienced compressed spark and dark spreads in addition given the current economic environment it is likely the demand for power could decrease these could lead to lower margins for our wholesale energy segment however we currently have fixed sales commitments for receipts of rpm capacity payments through may 2012 and power purchase and capacity agreement payments through 2014 totaling 19 billion of which 521 million relates to 2009 see note 12c to our consolidated financial statements during 2008 and 2007 we recognized in revenues combined rpm capacity payments and power purchase and capacity agreement payments of 479 million and 317 million respectively

liquidity and capital requirements 

 

our liquidity and capital requirements primarily reflect our working capital needs capital expenditures including environmental capital expenditures collateral requirements purchases of emissions allowances discretionary debt extinguishments and debt service examples of working capital needs include purchases of fuel and electricity including related settlements of derivatives plant maintenance costs payroll costs and fees and expenses associated with the unwind of our creditenhanced retail structure with merrill lynch settlement costs associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings can also have a significant impact on our liquidity and cash requirements for settlements see notes 13 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements

significant accounting policies 

 

see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

we make a number of estimates and judgments in preparing our consolidated financial statements these estimates can differ from actual results and have a significant impact on our recorded assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we consider an estimate to be a critical accounting estimate if it requires a high level of subjectivity or judgment and a significant change in the estimate would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations each critical accounting estimate affects both our retail energy and wholesale energy segments unless indicated otherwise the audit committee of our board of directors reviews each critical accounting estimate with our senior management further discussion of these accounting policies and estimates is in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

 

fair value—goodwill 

 

we consider the estimate of fair value for our wholesale energy and retail energy segments to be a critical accounting estimate because a a goodwill impairment could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and b the estimate is based on a number of highly subjective judgments and assumptions 

 

we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in april and more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment we have two reporting segments wholesale energy and retail energy goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level which is consistent with our reporting segments we continually assess whether any indicators of impairment exist which requires a significant amount of judgment such indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization a decline in our expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition overall weaknesses in our industry and slower growth rates any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

during april we tested goodwill for impairment and determined that no impairments existed 

 

during the third and fourth quarters of 2008 given recent adverse changes in the business climate and the credit markets see “ — 2008 significant events” and “—liquidity and capital resources” above our market capitalization being lower than our book value during all of the fourth quarter and extending into 2009 our review of strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value and reductions in our expected nearterm cash flows from operations we reviewed our goodwill for impairment we concluded that no goodwill impairments occurred as of september 30 2008 as discussed below as of december 31 2008 we concluded that our wholesale energy segment’s goodwill of 305 million was impaired this charge is noncash 

 

goodwill is reviewed for impairments based on a twostep test in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its net book value we must apply judgment in determining the fair value of our reporting units for purposes of performing our goodwill impairment tests because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available in estimating the fair values of the reporting units we use a combination of an income approach and a marketbased approach 

 

 43 

  

  

in weighting the results of the various valuation approaches prior to the fourth quarter of 2008 we placed more emphasis on the income approach using management’s future cash flow projections for each reporting unit and riskadjusted discount rates as our earnings outlook declined our earnings variability increased and our market capitalization declined significantly in 2008 we increased the weighting of the estimates of fair value of our reporting units determined by the marketbased approaches further the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting units was compared to our total market capitalization adjusted for a control premium a control premium is added to the market capitalization to reflect the value that exists with having control over an entire entity 

 

if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is higher than the recorded net book value no impairment is considered to exist and no further testing is required however if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the recorded net book value a second step must be performed to determine the goodwill impairment required if any in the second step the estimated fair value from the first step is used as the purchase price in a hypothetical acquisition of the reporting unit which is then allocated to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities in accordance with purchase accounting rules the residual amount of goodwill that results from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is compared to the recorded amount of goodwill for the reporting unit and the recorded amount is written down to the hypothetical amount if lower 

 

estimation of our wholesale energy reporting unit’s fair value we estimate the fair value of our wholesale energy reporting unit based on a number of subjective factors including a appropriate weighting of valuation approaches as discussed above b projections about the future power generation margins c estimates of our future cost structure d environmental assumptions e riskadjusted discount rates for our estimated cash flows f selection of peer group companies for the public company market approach g required level of working capital h assumed ebitda multiple for terminal values and i time horizon of cash flow forecasts 

 

as part of our process we develop 15year forecasts of earnings and cash flows assuming that demand for power grows at the rate of two percent a year we model all of our power generation facilities and those of others in the regions in which we operate using these assumptions a the markets in which we operate will continue to be deregulated and earn a market return b there will be a recovery in electricity margins over time such that companies building new generation facilities can earn a reasonable rate of return on their investment which implies that margins and therefore cash flows in the future would be better than they are today because market prices will need to rise high enough to provide an incentive for new plants to be built and the entire market will realize the benefit of those higher margins and c the longterm returns on future construction of new generation facilities will likely be driven by integrated utilities which we expect will have a lower cost of capital than merchant generators which implies that the revenues and margins described in b above will be at the level of return required for a regulated entity instead of a deregulated company we assume that the aftertax rate of return on new construction is 75 

our assumptions for each of our goodwill impairment assessments during 2006 2007 and 2008 

 

 

 

 

  

based on our analysis we concluded that the wholesale energy reporting unit did not pass the first step as of december 31 2008 primarily due to lower expected cash flows due to the adverse business climate significantly lower expected exchange transaction values due to credit market disruptions which would make it difficult for transactions to occur and increase the price of those transactions and significantly lower valuations for our peer companies in addition when we compared the aggregate of our fair value estimates of both reporting units to our market capitalization including a control premium we determined that the market participants’ views of our fair value had also declined significantly 

 

we then performed the second step of the impairment test which requires an allocation of the fair value as the purchase price in a hypothetical acquisition of the reporting unit the significant hypothetical purchase price allocation adjustments made to the assets and liabilities of our wholesale energy reporting unit consisted of the following 

 

  

after making these hypothetical adjustments no residual value remained for a goodwill allocation resulting in the impairment of our wholesale energy reporting unit’s goodwill net carrying amount of 305 million as of december 31 2008 

 

estimation of our retail energy reporting unit’s fair value we estimate the fair value of our retail energy reporting unit based on a number of subjective factors including a appropriate weighting of valuation approaches as discussed above b projections about future customer mix and related revenues c estimates of our future cost structure d riskadjusted discount rates for our estimated cash flows e selection of peer group companies for the public company market approach f required level of working capital g assumed ebitda multiple for terminal values and h time horizon of cash flow forecasts for the most recent reporting period we determined that the recently announced sale to a subsidiary of nrg energy inc was the best estimate of the value of our retail energy reporting unit using that measure the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the book value and therefore the goodwill was not impaired as of december 31 2008 

fair value—property plant and equipment 

 

we consider the fair value estimate used to calculate impairment of property plant and equipment a critical accounting estimate this estimate primarily affects our wholesale energy segment which holds approximately 98 of our total net property plant and equipment see note 2i to our consolidated financial statements in determining the existence of an impairment in carrying value we make a number of subjective assumptions as to 

 

  

fair value—derivative assets and liabilities 

 

effective january 1 2008 we adopted sfas no 157 on a prospective basis for our derivative assets and liabilities in determining fair value we generally use the market approach and incorporate assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 

 

sfas no 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs level 1 or level 2 and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs level 3 by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available derivative instruments classified as level 2 primarily include overthecounter otc derivative instruments such as generic swaps and forwards the fair value measurements of these derivative assets and liabilities are based largely on unadjusted indicative quoted prices from independent brokers in active markets an active market is considered to have transactions with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis derivative instruments for which fair value is calculated using quoted prices that are deemed not active or that have been extrapolated from quoted prices in active markets are classified as level 3 for certain natural gas and power contracts we adjust seasonal or calendar year quoted prices based on historical observations to represent fair value for each month in the season or calendar year such that the average of all months is equal to the quoted price a derivative instrument that has a tenor that does not span the quoted period is considered an unobservable level 3 measurement 

 

we evaluate and validate the inputs we use to estimate fair value by a number of methods including validating against market published prices and daily broker quotes obtainable from multiple pricing services for otc derivative instruments classified as level 2 indicative quotes obtained from brokers in liquid markets generally represent fair value of these instruments adjustments to the quotes are adjustments to the bid or ask price depending on the nature of the position to appropriately reflect exit pricing and are considered a level 3 input to the fair value measurement in less liquid markets such as coal in which a single broker’s view of the market is used to estimate fair value we consider such inputs to be unobservable level 3 inputs 

 

we report our derivative assets and liabilities for which the normal purchasenormal sale exception has not been made at fair value and consider it to be a critical accounting estimate because these estimates are highly susceptible to change from period to period and are dependent on many subjective factors including 

 

  

fair value for energy derivatives is further derived from credit adjustments derivative assets are discounted using a yield curve representative of the counterparty’s probability of default the counterparty’s 

default probability is based on a modified version of published default rates taking 20year historical default rates from standard  poor’s and moody’s and adjusting them to reflect a rolling fiveyear average for derivative liabilities fair value measurement reflects the nonperformance risk related to that liability which is our own credit risk we derive our nonperformance risk by applying our credit default swap spread against the respective derivative liability as of december 31 2008 we had 0 and 97 million in reserves for nonperformance risk on derivative assets and derivative liabilities respectively 

 

to determine the fair value for level 3 energy derivatives where there are no market quotes or external valuation services we rely on various modeling techniques we use a variety of valuation models which vary in complexity depending on the contractual terms of and inherent risks in the instrument being valued we use both industrystandard models as well as internally developed proprietary valuation models that consider various assumptions such as market prices for power and fuel market implied heat rates load and price shapes ancillary services volatilities and correlations as well as other relevant factors as may be deemed appropriate there is inherent risk in valuation modeling given the complexity and volatility of energy markets therefore it is possible that results in future periods may be materially different as contracts are ultimately settled

retail energy segment estimated revenues and energy supply costs 

 

accrued unbilled revenues accrued unbilled revenues of 482 million as of december 31 2008 represented 4 of our consolidated revenues and 5 of our retail energy segment’s revenues for 2008 accrued unbilled revenues of 435 million as of december 31 2007 represented 4 of our consolidated revenues and 5 of our retail energy segment’s revenues for 2007 

 

accrued unbilled revenues are critical accounting estimates as volumes are not precisely known at the end of each reporting period and the revenue amounts are material if our estimate of electricity usage were to increase or decrease by 3 our accrued unbilled revenues as of december 31 2008 would have increased or decreased by approximately 15 million 

 

estimated energy supply costs we record energy supply costs for electricity sales and services to retail customers based on estimated supply volumes for the applicable reporting period this is a critical accounting estimate as volumes are not known at the end of each reporting period and the purchased power amounts are material 

 

a portion of our energy supply costs 83 million and 74 million as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively consisted of estimated transmission and distribution charges not yet billed by the transmission and distribution utilities 

 

in estimating supply volumes we consider the effects of historical customer volumes weather factors and usage by customer class we estimate our transmission and distribution delivery fees using the same method that we use for electricity sales and services to retail customers in addition we estimate ercot iso fees based on historical trends estimated supply volumes and initial ercot iso settlements volume estimates are then multiplied by the supply rate and recorded as purchased power in the applicable reporting period if our estimate of electricity usage volumes increased or decreased by 3 our energy supply costs would have increased or decreased by approximately 13 million as of december 31 2008 changes in our volume usage would have resulted in a similar offsetting change in billed volumes thus partially mitigating our energy supply costs 

 

dependence on ercot iso settlement procedures preliminary settlement information is due from the ercot iso within two months after electricity is delivered final settlement information is due from the ercot iso within six months after electricity is delivered the six month settlement received from ercot is considered final as ercot will only resettle if there are data errors greater than 2 of that day’s transaction dollars or if alternate dispute resolutions are granted we record our estimated supply costs and 

related fees using estimated supply volumes as discussed above and adjust those costs upon receipt of the ercot iso information delays in settlements could materially affect the accuracy of our recorded energy supply costs and related fees 

 

loss contingencies 

 

we record loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated we consider loss contingency estimates to be critical accounting estimates because they entail significant judgment regarding probabilities and ranges of exposure and the ultimate outcome of the proceedings is unknown and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows see notes 13 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

deferred tax assets valuation allowances and tax liabilities 

 

we estimate a income taxes in the jurisdictions in which we operate b deferred tax assets and liabilities based on expected future taxes in the jurisdictions in which we operate c valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and d uncertain income tax positions these estimates are considered critical accounting estimates because they require projecting future operating results which is inherently imprecise and judgments related to the ultimate determination of tax positions by taxing authorities also these estimates depend on assumptions regarding our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

we assess our future ability to use federal state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards capital loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets using the morelikelythannot criteria these assessments include an evaluation of our recent history of earnings and losses future reversals of temporary differences and identification of other sources of future taxable income including the identification of tax planning strategies in certain situations

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

our primary market risk exposure relates to fluctuations in commodity prices principally natural gas power coal and oil we also have had market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates as described in notes 2f and 2g to our consolidated financial statements we have a risk control framework to manage our risk exposure however the effectiveness of this framework can never be completely estimated or fully assured for example we could experience volatility in earnings from basis price differences transmission issues price correlation issues volume variation or other factors including margins being compressed as a result of market prices behaving differently than expected in addition a reduction in market liquidity may impair the effectiveness of our risk management practices and resulting hedge strategies these and other factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 

nontrading market risks 

 

commodity price risk 

 

changes in commodity prices prior to the energy delivery period are inherent in our wholesale and retail energy businesses however we believe the benefits of generally hedging our generation assets do not justify the costs including collateral postings accordingly we may enter selective hedges including originated transactions based on our assessment of a market fundamentals to increase the return from our generation assets and b operational and market limitations requiring us to enter into fuel capacity and emissions transactions to manage our generation assets in our retail energy business we routinely enter into derivative contracts to manage our purchase and sale commitments we use derivative instruments such as futures forwards swaps and options to execute our wholesale hedge strategy and retail supply procurement strategy for further discussion of these strategies and related market risks see notes 2 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2008 the fair values of the contracts related to our net nontrading derivative assets and liabilities are 

 

 

 

 

  

the fair values shown in the table above are subject to significant changes due to fluctuating commodity forward market prices volatility and credit risk market prices assume a functioning market with an adequate number of buyers and sellers to provide liquidity insufficient market liquidity could significantly affect the values that could be obtained for these contracts as well as the costs at which these contracts could be hedged for further discussion of how we arrive at these fair values see note 2d to our consolidated financial statements and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—new accounting pronouncements significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates—critical accounting estimates” in item 7 of this form 10k 

 

a hypothetical 10 movement in the underlying energy prices would have the following potential loss impacts on our nontrading derivatives 

 

 

 

this risk analysis does not include the favorable impact that the same hypothetical price movements would have on our physical purchases and sales of fuel and power to which the hedges relate the adverse impact of changes in commodity prices on our portfolio of nontrading energy derivatives would be offset although not necessarily in the same period by a favorable impact on the underlying physical transactions assuming 

 

  

if any of these assumptions cease to be true we may experience a benefit or loss relative to the underlying exposure 

 

interest rate risk 

 

as of december 31 2008 and 2007 we have no variable rate debt outstanding we earn interest income for which the interest rates vary on our cash and cash equivalents and net margin deposits our variable rate interest expense and interest income was 0 and 28 million respectively during 2008 and 14 million and 33 million respectively during 2007 

 

if interest rates decreased by one percentage point from their december 31 2008 and 2007 levels the fair values of our fixed rate debt would have increased by 124 million and 201 million respectively 

 

trading market risks 

 

prior to march 2003 we engaged in proprietary trading activities as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements trading positions entered into prior to our decision to exit this business are being closed on economical terms or are being retained and settled over the contract terms in addition we have transactions relating to noncore asset management such as gas storage and transportation contracts not tied to generation assets which are classified as trading activities 

 

as of december 31 2008 the fair values of the contracts related to our legacy trading and noncore asset management positions and recorded as net derivative assets and liabilities are 

 

 

 

 

  

the fair values in the above table are subject to significant changes based on fluctuating market prices and conditions see the discussion above related to nontrading derivative assets and liabilities for further information on items that impact our portfolio of trading contracts 

 

our consolidated realized and unrealized margins relating to these positions are income loss 

 

 

 

an analysis of these net derivative assets and liabilities is 

 

 

 

 

  

we primarily assess the risk of our legacy trading and noncore asset management positions using a valueatrisk method to maintain our total exposure within limits set by the audit committee valueatrisk is the potential loss in value of trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time period within a specified confidence level we use the parametric variancecovariance method with deltagamma approximation to calculate valueatrisk 

 

our valueatrisk model utilizes four major parameters 

 

 50 

 

  

while we believe that our valueatrisk assumptions and approximations are reasonable different assumptions andor approximations could produce materially different estimates an inherent limitation of valueatrisk is that past market risk may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk in addition valueatrisk calculated for a specified holding period does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within that specified period future transactions market volatility reduction of market liquidity failure of counterparties to satisfy their contractual obligations andor a failure of risk controls could result in material losses from our legacy trading and noncore asset management positions 

 

the daily valueatrisk for our legacy trading and noncore asset management positions is

we provide electricity and energy services to retail and wholesale customers through two business segments 

 

  

for information about our corporate history business segments and disposition activities see notes 1 18 20 21 and 22 to our consolidated financial statements and “selected financial data” in item 6 of this form 10k 

 

retail energy 

 

as a retail electricity provider we arrange for the transmission and delivery of electricity to our customers bill customers and collect payment for electricity sold and maintain call centers to provide customer service we purchase the electricity we sell to customers from generation companies utilities power marketers and other retail energy companies in the wholesale market we obtain our transmission and distribution services in texas from entities regulated by the puct 

 

our retail business for residential and small business customers is primarily concentrated in texas based on metered locations as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 16 million residential and 147000 small business customers making us the second largest mass market electricity provider in texas approximately 65 of our texas customers are in the houston area we also have customers in other texas cities including dallas ft worth and corpus christi 

 

in texas and the pjm market we market electricity and energy services to commercial industrial and governmentalinstitutional customers these customers include refineries chemical plants manufacturing facilities hospitals universities governmental agencies restaurants and other facilities based on metered locations as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 93000 commercial industrial and governmentalinstitutional customers 

 

during 2007 we began to pilot residential and small business products and services in texas that use advanced technology to help reduce customer consumption during peak usage periods “smart energy” products are expected to lower our supply and operating costs moderate consumer bills reduce emissions and enhance our position as a retail market leader 

 

under our supply strategy for our retail business we structure our supply portfolio to match our load demands by procuring sufficient power prior to or concurrent with entering into retail sales commitments because of our creditenhanced retail structure with a third party credit provider we are not required to post collateral for our retail supply purchases

see discussion of our retail energy strategy in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—business overview” in item 7 of this form 10k see discussion of “—competition and seasonality” below and in “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

  

wholesale energy 

 

as of december 31 2007 we owned had an interest in or leased 38 operating electric power generation facilities with an aggregate net generating capacity of 16337 mw in five regions of the united states the net generating capacity of these facilities consists of approximately 42 baseload 34 intermediate and 24 peaking capacity 

 

we sell electricity and energy services from our generation portfolio in hourahead dayahead and forward markets in bilateral and iso markets we sell these products to investorowned utilities municipalities cooperatives and other companies that serve end users or purchase power at wholesale for resale we obtain transmission and distribution services for our power generation from ercot various rtos utilities and municipalities because our facilities are not subject to traditional costbased regulation we can generally sell electricity at marketdetermined prices the following table identifies the principal markets where we own lease or have under contract wholesale generation assets 

 

 

 

through the pjm market’s reliability pricing model auctions we have committed approximately 6400 mw of capacity through the planning year ending may 2011 we expect that a substantial portion of our capacity that clears a pjm auction will continue to be committed to the pjm market up to three years in advance revenue from these capacity sales is determined by market rules designed to ensure regional reliability encourage competition and reduce price volatility the california public utility commission and cal iso are considering possible enhancements to existing resource adequacy requirements including alternatives similar to capacity markets designed in new england and pjm 

to ensure adequate fuel supplies we contract for natural gas coal and fuel oil for our generation facilities for our natural gasfired plants we also arrange for schedule and balance natural gas from our suppliers and through transporting pipelines to perform these functions we lease natural gas transportation and storage capacity 

 

in february 2006 we completed an evaluation of our wholesale energy segment’s hedging strategy and use of capital as a result of our evaluation we substantially reduced hedging activity

regulation 

 

texas 

 

we are certified by the puct to provide retail electric service in texas we sell electricity in the competitive areas of ercot to customers at unregulated prices our activities in texas are subject to standards and regulations adopted by ercot see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k 

 

until january 1 2007 we were required to make electricity available to houston area residential and small business customers at the puctapproved “pricetobeat” any residential “pricetobeat” customers who did not select an alternative product by december 31 2006 continued being served under our residential services plan 

 

other states 

 

we are certified in delaware and illinois to supply retail electric service to commercial and industrial customers in those states our retail activities in delaware and illinois are subject to standards and regulations adopted by pjm and each state’s utility commission 

 

we operate electric generation facilities in regions administered by pjm cal iso and miso these isos operate under fercapproved market rules the market rules include price limits or caps applicable to all 

generators and numerous other fercapproved requirements relative to the manner in which we must operate our generating facilities 

 

federal energy regulatory commission 

 

a number of our subsidiaries are public utilities under the federal power act and are subject to ferc rules and oversight regulations as public utilities these subsidiaries sell power at either marketbased rates if ferc has granted marketbased rate authority or costbased rates each of these subsidiaries has been granted marketbased rate authority although a limited number of services sold by some of them are sold at costbased rates 

 

competition and seasonality 

 

the retail and wholesale energy industries are intensely competitive our competitors include merchant energy companies utilities retail electric service providers and other companies including in recent years companies owned by investment banking firms hedge funds and private equity funds our principal competitors in the retail electricity markets outside of houston are typically incumbent retail electric providers which have the advantage of longstanding relationships with customers in general competition in the retail and wholesale energy markets is on the basis of price service brand image and product offerings as well as market perceptions of creditworthiness for additional information on the effect of competition and for a discussion of how seasonality impacts our business see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k and note 17 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

environmental matters 

 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local requirements relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of personnel and the public these requirements relate to a broad range of our activities including the discharge of compounds into the air water and soil the proper handling of solid hazardous and toxic materials and waste noise and safety and health standards applicable to the workplace 

 

based on existing regulations our market outlook and our current assessment of the costs of labor and materials and the state of evolving technologies we estimate that we will invest approximately 261 million in 2008 115 million in 2009 and 33 million to 338 million in 2010 through 2014 on projects to reduce our emission levels and lessen the environmental impact of our operations these amounts include 39 million for future ash landfill expansions from 2008 through 2014 as described below a significant amount of these expenditures relate to our election to upgrade the so 2 emissions controls at some of our facilities 

 

in some cases which are described below environmental laws and regulations are pending are under consideration are in dispute or could be revised unless otherwise noted we cannot predict the ultimate effect of these matters on our business for additional information on how environmental matters may impact our business see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k and note 13b to our consolidated financial statements 

 

air quality 

 

under the clean air act the epa has implemented a number of emission control programs that affect industrial sources including power plants by limiting emissions of nox and so 2  nox and so 2 are precursors to the formation of acid rain fine particulate matter and regional haze nox is also a precursor to the formation of ozone 

 

no x and so 2 emissions 

 

in march 2005 the epa finalized a regulation referred to as the clean air interstate rule to further reduce emissions of nox and so 2 in the eastern united states in two phases the first phase which takes 

effect in 2009 for nox and 2010 for so 2  requires overall reductions within the area of approximately 50 in nox and so 2 emissions on an annual basis the second phase which takes effect in 2015 requires additional reductions of approximately 10 for a 60 total reduction in nox and approximately 15 for a 65 reduction in so 2  the epa regulations include the use of capandtrade programs to achieve these reductions 

 

these regulations require us to provide an allowance for each ton of nox and so 2 that we emit under a capandtrade program we maintain emission allowances that at a minimum correspond with forward power sales in general we do not have emission allowances for all of our generation we purchase emission allowances as needed to correspond with our generation of electricity 

 

we have undertaken studies to evaluate possible impacts of the clean air interstate rule and similar legislative and regulatory proposals which will primarily affect our coalfired facilities in the eastern united states based on an economic analysis that includes plant operability changes in the emission allowances market potential impact of stateimposed regulations and our estimates at this time of capital expenditures we have elected to invest 217 million in 2008 51 million in 2009 and an estimated 26 million to 304 million in 2010 through 2013 to principally reduce our emissions of so 2  

 

mercury emissions 

 

in march 2005 the epa finalized the clean air mercury rule camr a national rule designed to reduce mercury emissions from coal plants in two phases through a capandtrade system camr targets phase i reductions of approximately 30 in 2010 and phase ii reductions of approximately 70 in 2018 

 

states are permitted to adopt regulations that conform to camr or adopt their own mercury regulations that are stricter than camr ohio has adopted regulations implementing camr pennsylvania has finalized stricter regulations for mercury emissions pennsylvania’s program generally requires mercury reductions on a facility basis in two phases with 80 reductions in 2010 and 90 reductions in 2015 

 

several states initiated litigation targeting camr in particular to require mercury control on a facility basis instead of through a capandtrade system in february 2008 a federal appeals court struck down camr as unlawful the outcome of this ruling on ohio and some other state regulations is uncertain but it may impact our ultimate requirements to control mercury pennsylvania is expected to continue implementation of its program 

 

our preliminary estimate of capital expenditures to comply primarily with the first phase of pennsylvania’s mercury control program is 88 million to 103 million for 2008 through 2010 our analysis and evaluation of alternatives for compliance with the second phase of pennsylvania’s program including potential capital expenditures for controls is underway 

 

air particulates 

 

in september 2006 the epa issued revised national ambient air quality standards for fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 25 microns or pm25 individual states must identify the sources of emissions in noncompliant areas and develop emission reduction plans these plans may be statespecific or regional in scope if our generating assets are located in areas that are not in compliance we could be required to take additional or accelerated steps to reduce our nox and so 2 emissions 

 

greenhouse gas emissions 

 

there is increasing focus within the united states over the direction of domestic climate change policy several states in the northeastern midwestern and western united states are increasingly active in developing statespecific or regional regulatory initiatives to stimulate co 2 emission reductions in the electric power generation industry and other industries the united states congress is considering numerous bills that would impose mandatory limitation of co 2 and other greenhouse gas emissions for the domestic power generation sector the specific impact on our business will depend upon the form of emissionsrelated legislation or regulations ultimately adopted by the federal government or states in which our facilities are located ten 

northeastern states including new jersey and maryland have formed the regional greenhouse gas initiative or rggi which requires power generators to reduce co 2 emissions by ten percent by 2019 beginning in 2009 california adopted legislation designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 25 below 1990 levels by 2020 beginning in 2012 

 

in addition the epa has announced plans to consider regulations to address co 2 emissions as part of the clean air act’s new source review program individual states may also begin to take into account co 2 emissions when considering permits to construct or modify significant sources of emissions 

 

in september 2007 we joined the chicago climate exchange a voluntary greenhouse gas registry reduction and trading system by joining the exchange we have committed to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to six percent below the average of our 19982001 levels by 2010 we expect to satisfy our reduction targets through previously implemented unit retirements and capacity factor reductions and ongoing heat rate improvement efforts and transacting on the exchange 

 

water quality 

 

in july 2007 the epa suspended its 2004 regulations relating to cooling water intake structures at large existing power plants pending further rulemaking this action was in response to the second circuit court of appeals’ january 2007 remand of the 2004 regulations the epa retained interim requirements that associated intakes employ best technology available controls as determined on a plantbyplant best professional judgment basis 

 

other 

 

as a result of their age many of our facilities contain significant amounts of asbestos insulation other asbestos containing materials as well as leadbased paint existing state and federal rules require the proper management and disposal of these potentially toxic materials we believe we properly manage and dispose of such materials in compliance with these state and federal rules see note 13b to our consolidated financial statements 

 

we do not believe we have any material liabilities or obligations under the comprehensive environmental response corporation and liability act of 1980 or similar state laws these laws impose clean up and restoration liability on owners and operators of facilities from or at which there has been a release or threatened release of hazardous substances together with those who have transported or arranged for the disposal of those substances 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2007 we had 3698 fulltime and parttime employees of these employees 1085 are covered by collective bargaining agreements which expire on various dates from april 30 2008 through april 30 2012 the following table sets forth the number of our employees as of december 31 2007

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

risks related to the retail and wholesale energy businesses 

 

the financial results of our wholesale and retail energy segments are subject to market risks beyond our control 

 

our results of operations financial condition and cash flows are significantly impacted by the prevailing demand and market prices for electricity purchased power fuel and emission allowances over which we have no control market prices can fluctuate dramatically in response to many factors including weather conditions changes in the prices of related commodities changes in law and regulation regulatory intervention including the imposition of price limitations bidding rules or similar mechanisms market illiquidity transmission constraints environmental limitations generation unit outages fuel supply issues national and worldwide economic activity and other events 

 

the markets in which we operate are relatively immature markets that are characterized by elements of both deregulated and regulated markets changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate could adversely affect our ability to set rates or the cost manner or feasibility of conducting our business 

 

we operate in a regulatory environment that is undergoing varying restructuring initiatives in many instances the regulatory structures governing the electricity markets are still evolving creating gaps in the regulatory framework and associated uncertainty in addition existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to our facilities or our commercial activities we cannot predict the future direction of these initiatives or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on our business consequently future regulatory restrictions regulatory or political intervention or changes in laws and regulations may constrain our ability to set rates at market prices or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business see “business—regulation” in item 1 of this form 10k 

 

the tightening of the supply and demand balance for electricity may result in significant long and shortterm price volatility in both our wholesale and retail businesses price volatility may result in legislative regulatory or judicial initiatives intended to mitigate the impact of such volatility 

 

the permitting and construction of new generation facilities is a lengthy process additionally the progressive tightening of environmental regulatory requirements and their reflection in permits and regulations may result in generation facilities being removed from service prior to their end of useful life or derated permanently or temporarily as a result there may be periods when the supply of electricity is reduced or constrained relative to the demand for electricity during these periods the wholesale price and retail price of electricity may increase significantly in response to this legislators regulators consumers and others may seek legislative regulatory or judicial relief in an attempt to control or limit the wholesale price andor the retail price of electricity 

we depend on sources facilities and systems that we do not own or control for our fuel and fuel supply and to deliver electricity to and bill our customers any disruption in these sources facilities or systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

 

we depend on fuel sources and fuel supply facilities owned and operated by third parties to supply our generation plants we depend on power transmission and distribution facilities and metering systems owned and operated by third parties to deliver electricity to our customers and provide energy usage data if these sources facilities or systems fail are disrupted or become unavailable to us we may be unable to generate andor provide electricity our cost of doing so may significantly increase andor we may be subject to contractual or other penalties in addition inaccurate or untimely information from third parties could hinder our ability to bill customers and collect amounts owed we also participate in regional power pools reliability councils and transmission organizations and changes in the rules governing such groups andor in the composition of such groups may have an adverse effect on our business participation in rtos is voluntary and transmission owning companies may exit an rto so long as they do so in compliance with the applicable ferc tariffs and agreements and ferc approval 

 

the operation of generation facilities involves significant risks that could interrupt operations and increase our costs 

 

ownership of generation assets exposes us to risks relating to the breakdown of equipment or processes fuel supply or transportation interruptions construction delays or cost overruns shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment material and labor operational restrictions resulting from environmental limitations and governmental interventions as well as other risks in addition many of our facilities are old and require significant maintenance expenditures we are party to collective bargaining agreements with labor unions at several of our plants if our workers were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown other employees were to become unionized or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated we could experience a significant disruption in our operations and higher ongoing labor costs similarly we have an aging workforce at a number of our plants creating potential knowledge and expertise gaps as those workers retire if we are unable to secure fuel we will not be able to run our generation units construction delays could cause extended andor unplanned outages of our generation facilities if a generation unit fails or is unavailable we may have to purchase replacement power from third parties at higher prices we have insurance subject to limits and deductibles covering some types of physical damage and business interruption related to our generation units however this insurance may not always be available on commercially reasonable terms in addition there is no assurance that insurance proceeds will be sufficient to cover all losses insurance payments will be timely made or the policies themselves will be free of substantial deductibles 

 

our business operations expose us to the risk of loss if third parties fail to perform their contractual obligations 

 

we may incur losses if third parties default on their contractual obligations such as obligations to pay us money buy or sell electricity fuel emission allowances and other commodities or provide us with fuel transportation services power transmission or distribution services for additional information about third party default risk including our efforts to mitigate against this risk see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—credit risk” in item 7 of this form 10k and note 2e to our consolidated financial statements 

 

our costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant and can affect our future financial results 

 

our wholesale energy business is subject to extensive and evolving environmental regulations particularly our coal and oilfired generation facilities we incur significant costs in complying with these regulations and if we fail to comply could incur significant penalties our cost estimates for compliance with environmental regulations are based on our current assessment of the cost of labor and materials and the state of evolving technologies changes to the preceding factors revisions of environmental regulations litigation and new 

legislation andor regulations including new climate change legislation and regulations as well as other factors could cause our actual costs to vary outside the range of our estimates in addition failure to comply with environmental requirements could require us to shut down or reduce production on our generation facilities or create liability exposure new environmental laws or regulations may be adopted that would further constrain our operations or increase our environmental compliance costs we also may be responsible for the environmental liabilities associated with generation facilities even if a prior owner caused the liabilities we are required to purchase emission allowances to operate some of our facilities such allowances may be unavailable or only available at costs that would make it uneconomical to operate our generating assets see “business—environmental matters” in item 1 of this form 10k and note 13b to our consolidated financial statements 

 

failure to obtain or maintain any required permits or approvals could prevent or limit us from operating our business 

 

to operate our generating facilities and retail electric business we must obtain and maintain various permits licenses approvals and certificates from governmental agencies in some jurisdictions we must also meet minimum requirements for customer service and comply with local consumer protection and other laws our failure to obtain or maintain any necessary governmental permits or licenses or to satisfy these legal requirements including environmental compliance provisions could limit our ability to operate our business or create liability exposure 

 

we could be liable for a share of the payment defaults of other market participants 

 

if a market participant defaults on its payment obligations to an iso we together with other market participants are liable for a portion of the default obligation that is not otherwise covered by the defaulting market participant each iso establishes credit requirements applicable to market participants and the basis for allocating payment default amounts to market participants in ercot the allocation is based on share of the total load as of december 31 2007 we would have been liable for approximately 20 of any defaulted amount in ercot in pjm miso and cal iso the methods of allocating the share of defaults differ and our exposure from these markets is currently relatively small 

 

significant events beyond our control such as hurricanes and other weatherrelated problems or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

the uncertainty associated with events beyond our control such as significant weather events and the risk of future terrorist activity may affect our results of operations and financial condition in unpredictable ways these events could result in adverse changes in the insurance markets and disruptions of power and fuel markets in addition terrorist actions could damage or shut down our generation facilities or the fuel and fuel supply facilities or the power transmission and distribution facilities upon which our generation and retail businesses are dependent these events could also adversely affect the united states economy create instability in the financial markets and as a result have an adverse effect on our ability to access capital on terms and conditions acceptable to us 

 

risks relating to our retail business 

 

merrill lynch provides credit support for our retail business 

 

under the terms of our creditenhanced retail structure merrill lynch  co inc and an affiliate merrill lynch provide guarantees and post collateral for the supply purchases and related transactions of our texas and pjm retail energy business if we do not comply with the material terms of our agreement merrill lynch could terminate its future obligations to provide guarantees and collateral postings on our behalf there are a number of events including nonpayments of obligations and a noninvestmentgrade credit rating that could cause merrill lynch to default if merrill lynch experiences downgrades in its credit rating or credit outlook our suppliers may require other credit support or cease doing business with us pursuant to the creditenhanced 

retail structure in these events our ability to operate our texas and pjm retail business could be impaired which would adversely affect our liquidity cash flows and results of operations 

 

we depend on third parties to provide electricity to supply our retail customers 

 

we purchase substantially all of our supply requirements from third parties as a result our financial performance depends on our ability to obtain adequate supplies of electric generation from third parties at prices below the prices we charge our customers 

 

rising power supply costs could adversely affect the financial performance of our retail electric operations 

 

our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in any period in which our power supply costs rise at a greater rate than our rates charged to customers the price of our power supply purchases associated with our energy commitments can be different than that reflected in the rates charged to customers due to among other factors 

 

  

we may lose further market share in the houston retail electricity market which is a significant contributor of income to our consolidated results 

 

in recent years we have experienced declines in our share of the houston retail electricity market which represents approximately 65 of our residential customer base this trend could continue the new competitive market has attracted a number of new participants competitors are putting downward pressure on our houston sales volumes and may put downward pressure on our margins over time see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—business overview” in item 7 of this form 10k 

 

violations of market power standards may negatively impact the wholesale cost of power 

 

in 2006 the puct implemented a new rule on resource adequacy and market power in the ercot region in this rule the puct increased the current price cap applicable to generation offers into the ercot energy market eliminated current market power mitigation measures and adopted new market power standards if a market participant violates the market power standards and it is not adequately mitigated such violation could have the impact of increasing the wholesale cost of power which could adversely impact our gross margins in the texas retail market 

 

we depend on the isos to communicate operating and system information in a timely and accurate manner information that is not accurate or timely can have an impact on our future reported financial results 

 

each iso communicates information relating to a customer’s choice of retail electric provider and other data needed for servicing of customer accounts to utilities and retail electric providers any failure to perform these tasks will result in delays and other problems in enrolling switching and billing customers some of the isos are also responsible for settling all electricity supply volumes in their region information that is not accurate or timely may result in incorrect estimates of our settled volumes and supply costs that would need to be corrected when such information is received see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—new accounting pronouncements significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates—critical accounting estimates” in item 7 of this form 10k 

 

risks related to our company 

 

our borrowing levels debt service obligations and restrictive covenants may adversely affect our business we may be vulnerable to reductions in our cash flow 

 

as of december 31 2007 we had total gross debt of 30 billion 

 

  

if we were unable to generate sufficient cash flows access funds from operations or raise cash from other sources we would not be able to meet our debt service and other obligations these situations could result from adverse developments in the energy fuel or capital markets a disruption in our operations or those of third parties or other events adversely affecting our cash flows and financial performance 

 

our hedging and other risk management activities may not work as planned 

 

our hedges may not be effective as a result of basis price differences transmission issues price correlation volume variations or other factors see “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in item 7a of this form 10k 

 

changes in the wholesale energy market or changes in our evaluation of generation assets could result in impairments 

 

if our outlook for the wholesale energy market changes negatively or if our ongoing evaluation of our wholesale energy segment results in decisions to mothball retire or dispose of generation assets we could have impairment charges related to goodwill or our fixed assets see notes 2g and 2h to our consolidated financial statements 

 

lawsuits regulatory proceedings and tax proceedings could adversely affect our future financial results 

 

from time to time we are named as a party to or our property is the subject of lawsuits regulatory proceedings or tax proceedings these proceedings involve highly subjective matters with complex factual and legal questions their outcome is uncertain any claim that is successfully asserted against us could result in significant damage claims and other losses even if we prevail any proceedings could be costly and timeconsuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows see notes 11 13 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

we have entered into outsourcing arrangements with third party service providers in addition our operations are highly dependent on computer and other operating systems including telecommunications systems any interruptions in these arrangements or systems could significantly disrupt our business operations 

 

in recent years we have entered into outsourcing arrangements such as information technology production software infrastructure and development and certain functions within customer operations with 

third party service providers if these service providers do not perform their obligations we may incur significant costs and experience interruptions in our business operations in connection with switching to other service providers or assuming these obligations ourselves we are also highly dependent on our specialized computer and communications systems the operation of which could be interrupted by fire flood power loss computer viruses or similar disruptions there is no guarantee that our backup systems and disaster recovery plans will be effective 

 

if we acquire or develop additional generation assets or dispose of existing generation assets we may incur additional costs and risks 

 

we may seek to purchase or develop additional generation facilities or dispose of existing generation facilities there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful in any sale we may be required to indemnify a purchaser against liabilities to finance future acquisitions we may be required to issue additional equity securities or incur additional debt

business overview 

 

our objective is to be a leader in delivering the benefits of competitive electricity markets to customers our business focuses on the competitive retail and wholesale electricity markets 

 

our strategy is based on our core beliefs about the power industry and the retail and wholesale electricity markets we are committed to delivering superior returns from competitive markets through insights into the fundamentals of our core markets and a commitment to riskweighted investments whose return on invested capital exceeds our weightedaverage cost of capital 

 

retail energy the retail energy segment is a low capital investment electricity resale business with relatively stable earnings excluding unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives the key earnings drivers in the retail energy segment are the volume of electricity we sell to customers the unit margins received on those sales and the cost of acquiring and serving those customers we earn a margin by selling electricity to enduse customers and simultaneously acquiring supply while shortterm earnings in this business are impacted by local weather patterns and the competitive tactics of other retailers in the market the longerterm earnings drivers of the business are delivering a superior customer experience retaining and growing market share in our existing markets through innovative product offerings and expanding into new competitive markets 

 

our core beliefs about the retail market are 

 

 19 

 

  

these core beliefs set the stage for our strategic direction we will focus on the following valuecreation levers 

 

  

wholesale energy the wholesale energy segment is a capitalintensive cyclical business earnings are significantly impacted by spark spreads and capacity prices spark spreads are driven by a number of factors including the prices of natural gas coal and fuel oil the cost of emissions transmission weather and global macroeconomic factors none of which we control the key earnings drivers are the amount of electricity we generate the margin we earn for each unit of electricity sold and the availability of our generating assets to meet demand the factor that we have the most control over is the percentage of time that our generating assets are available to run when it is economical for them to do so longerterm earnings are driven by regional supply and demand fundamentals the level of commodity prices and capacity markets 

 

our core beliefs about the wholesale market are 

 

  

these core beliefs set the stage for our strategic direction we will focus on the following valuecreation levers 

 

  

companywide we will focus on the following valuecreation levers 

 

 20 

 

we also believe that stockholder value is enhanced through the development of a highly motivated and customerfocused work force we continue to focus on 

 

  

our ability to achieve these strategic objectives and execute these actions is subject to a number of factors some of which we may not be able to control see “cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information” and “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k 

 

recent events in february 2008 we entered into an agreement to sell our interests in channelview subject to approval of the court overseeing channelview’s bankruptcy proceedings and other closing conditions sale proceeds will be used to settle creditors’ claims and a cash sharing agreement residual proceeds will be retained by us and will affect the amount of any gain or loss on the sale it is possible an impairment could be recognized if the net proceeds and remaining assets including cash and working capital do not exceed our net investment in and receivables from channelview see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

consolidated results of operations 

 

the following discussion includes nongaap financial measures which are not standardized therefore it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names we strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure 

 

2007 compared to 2006 and 2006 compared to 2005 

 

we reported 365 million consolidated net income or 104 diluted income per share for 2007 compared to 328 million consolidated net loss or 107 loss per share for 2006 and 331 million consolidated net loss or 109 loss per share for 2005 

 

 

 

retail energy segment 

 

in analyzing the results of our retail energy segment we use the nongaap financial measures “retail gross margin” and “retail contribution margin” which exclude the item described below as well as our retail energy segment profit and loss measure “contribution margin including unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives” retail gross margin and retail contribution margin should not be relied upon without considering the gaap financial measures the item that is excluded from these nongaap financial measures has a recurring effect on our earnings and reflects aspects of our business that are not taken into account by this measure 

 

unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives we use derivative instruments to manage operational or market constraints and to execute our retail energy segment’s supply procurement strategy we are required to record in our consolidated statement of operations noncash gainslosses related to future periods based on current changes in forward commodity prices for derivative instruments receiving marktomarket accounting treatment we refer to these gains and losses prior to settlement as well as ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges as “unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives” in substantially all cases the underlying transactions being hedged receive accrual accounting treatment resulting in a mismatch of accounting treatments since the application of marktomarket accounting has the effect of pulling forward into current periods noncash gainslosses relating to and reversing in future delivery periods analysis of results of operations from one period to another can be difficult we believe that excluding these unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives provides a more meaningful representation of our economic performance in the reporting period and is therefore useful to us investors analysts and others in facilitating the analysis of our results of operations from one period to another 

our retail energy segment’s contribution margin including unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives was 942 million in 2007 compared to 250 million in 2006 the 692 million increase was primarily due to the net change in unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives of 725 million partially offset by a 32 million decrease in retail gross margin our retail energy segment’s contribution margin including unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives was 250 million in 2006 compared to 342 million in 2005 the 92 million decrease was primarily due to the increase in unrealized losses on energy derivatives of 218 million in addition contribution margin was impacted by a 232 million increase in retail gross margin and a 106 million increase in operation and maintenance selling and marketing and bad debt expense see “—retail energy margins” below for explanations

wholesale energy segment 

 

in analyzing the results of our wholesale energy segment we use the nongaap financial measures “open energy gross margin” “open wholesale gross margin” and “open wholesale contribution margin” which exclude the items described below as well as our wholesale energy segment profit and loss measure “contribution margin including historical and operational wholesale hedges and unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives” open energy gross margin open wholesale gross margin and open wholesale contribution margin should not be relied upon without considering the gaap financial measures the items that are excluded from these nongaap financial measures have or have had a recurring effect on our earnings and reflect aspects of our business that are not taken into account by these measures 

 

historical and operational wholesale hedges we exclude the effect of certain historical although recurring until the contracts terminate wholesale hedges that were entered into in order to hedge the economics of a portion of our wholesale operations these amounts primarily relate to settlements of forward power hedges longterm tolling purchases longterm natural gas transportation contracts not serving our generation assets and our legacy energy trading we also exclude the effect of certain ongoing operational wholesale hedges that were entered into primarily to mitigate certain operational risks at our generation assets these amounts primarily relate to settlements of fuel hedges longterm natural gas transportation contracts and storage contracts operational wholesale hedges are derived based on methodology consistent with the calculation of open energy gross margin we believe that it is useful to us investors analysts and others to show our results in the absence of both historical and operational hedges the impact of these hedges on our financial results is not a function of the operating performance of our generation assets and excluding the impact better reflects the operating performance of our generation assets based on prevailing market conditions 

 

unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives we use derivative instruments to manage operational or market constraints and to increase the return on our generation assets we are required to record in our consolidated statement of operations noncash gainslosses related to future periods based on current changes in forward commodity prices for derivative instruments receiving marktomarket accounting treatment we refer to these gains and losses prior to settlement as well as ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges as “unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives” in some cases the underlying transactions being hedged receive accrual accounting treatment resulting in a mismatch of accounting treatments since the application of marktomarket accounting has the effect of pulling forward into current periods noncash gainslosses relating to and reversing in future delivery periods analysis of results of operations from one period to another can be difficult we believe that excluding these unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives provides a more meaningful representation of our economic performance in the reporting period and is therefore useful to us investors analysts and others in facilitating the analysis of our results of operations from one period to another these gainslosses are also not a function of the operating performance of our generation assets and excluding their impact helps isolate the operating performance of our generation assets under prevailing market conditions 

 

changes in californiarelated receivables and reserves in 2005 we excluded the impact of changes in receivables and reserves relating to energy sales in california from october 2000 through june 2001 we reached a settlement concerning these receivables during the third quarter of 2005 because of the market conditions and regulatory events that underlie the changes in these receivables and reserves we believe that excluding this item provides a more meaningful representation of our results of operations on an ongoing basis and is therefore useful to us investors analysts and others in facilitating the analysis of our results of operations from one period to another for additional information see note 14a to our consolidated financial statements 

 

our wholesale energy segment’s contribution margin including historical and operational wholesale hedges and unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives was 524 million in 2007 compared to 146 million in 2006 the 378 million increase was primarily due to a reduced negative effect of historical and operational wholesale hedges of 284 million and b 184 million increase in open wholesale gross margin these increases were partially offset by a net change in unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives of 

49 million and b 40 million increase in operation and maintenance expense our wholesale energy segment’s contribution margin including historical and operational wholesale hedges and unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives was 146 million in 2006 compared to 110 million in 2005 the 36 million increase was primarily due to a net change in unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives of 179 million and b reduced negative effect of historical and operational wholesale hedges of 108 million these increases were partially offset by a 199 million decrease in open wholesale gross margin and b 55 million increase in operation and maintenance expense see “—wholesale energy margins” below for explanations

sources of liquidity and capital resources 

 

our principal sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations borrowings net proceeds from asset sales and securities offerings for a description of factors that could affect our liquidity and capital resources see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k and the discussion of restrictive covenants in notes 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

during 2007 we generated 755 million in operating cash flows from continuing operations including the changes in margin deposits of 297 million cash inflow and 57 million in payments relating to the western states and similar settlements cash outflow we expect to continue to have positive operating cash flow into 2008 and 2009 see “—historical cash flows” for further detail of our cash flows from operating activities and explanation around our 179 million use of cash from investing activities and 292 million use of cash from financing activities 

 

as of february 15 2008 we had total available liquidity of 16 billion comprised of unused borrowing capacity letters of credit capacity and cash and cash equivalents of this amount 300 million is only available to our retail business through our working capital facility agreement with merrill lynch in addition merrill lynch provides financial support that significantly reduces the liquidity requirements and substantially eliminates collateral postings for our retail business see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

liquidity and capital requirements 

 

our liquidity and capital requirements primarily reflect our working capital needs capital expenditures discretionary debt extinguishments debt service and collateral requirements examples of working capital needs include purchases of fuel and electricity purchases of emission allowances plant maintenance costs including environmental expenditures and payroll costs settlement costs associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings can also have a significant impact on our liquidity and cash requirements for settlements see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

in june 2007 we refinanced a significant portion of our senior secured debt as an initial step towards creating a capital structure that gives us increased flexibility to direct cash flow and additional capital to alternatives that we believe will create the greatest stockholder value we are evaluating various alternatives to address restrictions remaining in our 675 senior secured notes and our taxexempt pedfa bonds see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements

new accounting pronouncements 

 

see notes 2 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

significant accounting policies 

 

see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

we make a number of estimates and judgments in preparing our consolidated financial statements these estimates can differ from actual results and have a significant impact on our recorded assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we consider an estimate to be a critical accounting estimate if it requires a high level of subjectivity or judgment and a significant change in the estimate would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations each critical accounting estimate affects both our retail energy and wholesale energy segments unless indicated otherwise the audit committee of our board of directors reviews each critical accounting estimate with our senior management further discussion of these accounting policies and estimates is in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

fair value 

 

goodwill we consider the estimate of fair value to be a critical accounting estimate for our wholesale energy segment because a a goodwill impairment could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and b the estimate is based on a number of highly subjective judgments and assumptions see notes 2h and 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

property plant and equipment we consider the fair value estimate used to calculate impairment of property plant and equipment a critical accounting estimate this estimate primarily affects our wholesale energy segment which holds approximately 98 of our total net property plant and equipment see note 2g to our consolidated financial statements in determining the existence of an impairment in carrying value we make a number of subjective assumptions as to 

 

  

derivative assets and liabilities we report our derivative assets and liabilities for which the normal purchasenormal sale exception has not been made at fair value and consider it to be a critical accounting estimate because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period and are dependent on many subjective factors including 

 

  

to determine the fair value for energy derivatives where there are no market quotes or external valuation services we rely on various modeling techniques we use a variety of valuation models which vary in complexity depending on the contractual terms of and inherent risks in the instrument being valued we use both industrystandard models as well as internally developed proprietary valuation models that consider various assumptions such as market prices for power and fuel market implied heat rates load and price shapes ancillary services volatilities and correlations as well as other relevant factors as may be deemed appropriate there is inherent risk in valuation modeling given the complexity and volatility of energy markets therefore it is possible that results in future periods may be materially different as contracts are ultimately settled 

 

for additional information regarding our derivative assets and liabilities see notes 2d and 5 to our consolidated financial statements and “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in item 7a of this form 10k 

 

retail energy segment estimated revenues and energy supply costs 

 

accrued unbilled revenues accrued unbilled revenues of 435 million as of december 31 2007 represented 4 of our consolidated revenues and 5 of our retail energy segment’s revenues for 2007 accrued unbilled revenues of 416 million as of december 31 2006 represented 4 of our consolidated revenues and 5 of our retail energy segment’s revenues for 2006 

 

accrued unbilled revenues are critical accounting estimates as volumes are not precisely known at the end of each reporting period and the revenue amounts are material if our estimate of electricity usage were to 

increase or decrease by 3 our accrued unbilled revenues as of december 31 2007 would have increased or decreased by approximately 13 million 

 

estimated energy supply costs we record energy supply costs for electricity sales and services to retail customers based on estimated supply volumes for the applicable reporting period this is a critical accounting estimate as volumes are not known at the end of each reporting period and the purchased power amounts are material 

 

a portion of our energy supply costs 74 million and 61 million as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively consisted of estimated transmission and distribution charges not yet billed by the transmission and distribution utilities 

 

in estimating supply volumes we consider the effects of historical customer volumes weather factors and usage by customer class we estimate our transmission and distribution delivery fees using the same method that we use for electricity sales and services to retail customers in addition we estimate ercot iso fees based on historical trends estimated supply volumes and initial ercot iso settlements volume estimates are then multiplied by the supply rate and recorded as purchased power in the applicable reporting period if our estimate of electricity usage volumes increased or decreased by 3 our energy supply costs would have increased or decreased by approximately 12 million as of december 31 2007 changes in our volume usage would have resulted in a similar offsetting change in billed volumes thus partially mitigating our energy supply costs 

 

dependence on ercot iso settlement procedures preliminary settlement information is due from the ercot iso within two months after electricity is delivered final settlement information is due from the ercot iso within six months after electricity is delivered the six month settlement received from ercot is considered final as ercot will only resettle if there are data errors greater than 2 of that day’s transaction dollars or if alternate dispute resolutions are granted we record our estimated supply costs and related fees using estimated supply volumes as discussed above and adjust those costs upon receipt of the ercot iso information delays in settlements could materially affect the accuracy of our recorded energy supply costs and related fees 

 

loss contingencies 

 

we record loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated we consider loss contingency estimates to be critical accounting estimates because they entail significant judgment regarding probabilities and ranges of exposure and the ultimate outcome of the proceedings is unknown and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows see notes 13 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

deferred tax assets valuation allowances and tax liabilities 

 

we estimate a income taxes in the jurisdictions in which we operate b net deferred tax assets and liabilities based on expected future taxes in the jurisdictions in which we operate c valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and d uncertain income tax positions these estimates are considered critical accounting estimates because they require projecting future operating results which is inherently imprecise and judgments related to the ultimate determination of tax positions by taxing authorities also these estimates depend on assumptions regarding our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

we assess our future ability to use federal state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards capital loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets using the morelikelythannot criteria these assessments include an evaluation of our recent history of earnings and losses future reversals of temporary differences and identification of other sources of future taxable income including the identification of tax planning strategies in certain situations

market risks and risk management 

 

our primary market risk exposure relates to fluctuations in commodity prices we also have market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates as described in notes 2d and 2e to our consolidated financial statements we have a risk control framework to manage our risk exposure however the effectiveness of this framework can never be completely estimated or fully assured for example we could experience volatility in earnings from basis price differences transmission issues price correlation issues volume variation or other factors in addition a reduction in market liquidity may impair the effectiveness of our risk management practices and resulting hedge strategies these and other factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 

nontrading market risks 

 

commodity price risk 

 

changes in commodity prices prior to the energy delivery period are inherent in our wholesale and retail energy businesses we use derivative instruments such as futures forwards swaps and options to execute our wholesale hedge strategy and retail supply procurement strategy 

 

as of december 31 2007 the fair values of the contracts related to our net nontrading derivative assets and liabilities are 

 

 

 

 

  

the fair values shown in the table above are subject to significant changes due to fluctuating commodity forward market prices volatility and credit risk market prices assume a functioning market with an adequate number of buyers and sellers to provide liquidity insufficient market liquidity could significantly affect the values that could be obtained for these contracts as well as the costs at which these contracts could be hedged 

a hypothetical 10 movement in the underlying energy prices would have the following potential gain loss impacts on our nontrading derivatives 

 

 

 

this risk analysis does not include the favorable impact that the same hypothetical price movements would have on our physical purchases and sales of fuel and power to which the hedges relate the adverse impact of changes in commodity prices on our portfolio of nontrading energy derivatives would be offset although not necessarily in the same period by a favorable impact on the underlying physical transactions assuming 

 

  

if any of these assumptions cease to be true we may experience a benefit or loss relative to the underlying exposure see notes 2d and 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

interest rate risk 

 

we remain subject to the benefits or losses associated with movements in market interest rates related to certain variable rate debt cash cash equivalents and margin deposits which are most vulnerable to changes in the federal funds rate as we deconsolidated channelview on august 20 2007 and have no borrowings under our senior secured revolver or retail working capital facility we have no variable rate debt outstanding as of december 31 2007 

 

we assess interest rate risks using a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential change in our interest expenseincome based on a hypothetical one percentage point movement in the underlying variable interest rate indices if interest rates increaseddecreased by one percentage point our annual interest expense would have increaseddecreased for 2007 by 4 million and our annual interest income net of interest expense would have increaseddecreased by 2 million if interest rates increaseddecreased by one percentage point our annual interest expense would have increaseddecreased for 2006 by 15 million and our annual interest expense net of interest income would have increaseddecreased by 8 million 

 

we estimated these amounts by considering the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our variablerate debt cash and cash equivalents and net margin deposits based on average balances throughout the respective year 

 

if interest rates decreased by one percentage point from their december 31 2007 and 2006 levels the fair market values of our fixedrate debt would have increased by 201 million and 189 million respectively 

 

trading market risks 

 

prior to march 2003 we engaged in proprietary trading activities as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements trading positions entered into prior to our decision to exit this business are being closed on economical terms or are being retained and settled over the contract terms 

as of december 31 2007 the fair values of the contracts related to our legacy trading positions and recorded as net derivative assets and liabilities are 

 

 

 

the fair values in the above table are subject to significant changes based on fluctuating market prices and conditions for further discussion of items that impact our portfolio of trading contracts and an explanation of the sources of fair value see the discussion related to nontrading derivative assets and liabilities 

 

our consolidated realized and unrealized amounts relating to these positions are income loss 

 

 

 

an analysis of these net derivative assets and liabilities is 

 

 

 

 

  

we primarily assess the risk of our legacy trading positions using a valueatrisk method to maintain our total exposure within limits set by the audit committee valueatrisk is the potential loss in value of trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time period within a specified confidence level we use the parametric variancecovariance method with deltagamma approximation to calculate valueatrisk 

 

our valueatrisk model utilizes four major parameters 

 

  

while we believe that our valueatrisk assumptions and approximations are reasonable different assumptions andor approximations could produce materially different estimates an inherent limitation of 

valueatrisk is that past market risk may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk in addition valueatrisk calculated for a specified holding period does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within that specified period future transactions market volatility reduction of market liquidity failure of counterparties to satisfy their contractual obligations andor a failure of risk controls could result in material losses from our legacy trading positions 

 

the daily valueatrisk for our legacy trading positions is

general 

we provide electricity and energy services to retail and wholesale customers through two business segments 

·   retail energy— provides electricity and energy services to approximately 19 million retail electricity customers in texas including residential and small business customers and commercial industrial and governmentalinstitutional customers we also serve commercial industrial and governmental institutional customers in the pjm market and we regularly evaluate entering other markets

·   wholesale energy —provides electricity and energy services in the competitive wholesale energy markets in the united states through our ownership and operation or contracting for power generation capacity as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 16000 mw of owned leased or contracted for generation capacity in operation

for information about our corporate history business segments and disposition activities see notes 1 18 20 and 21 to our consolidated financial statements and “selected financial data” in item 6 of this form 10k 

retail energy 

as a retail electricity provider we arrange for the transmission and delivery of electricity to our customers bill customers and collect payment for electricity sold and maintain call centers to provide customer service we purchase the electricity we sell to customers from generation companies utilities power marketers and other retail energy companies in the wholesale market we obtain our transmission and distribution services in texas from entities regulated by the puct 

our retail business for residential and small business customers is primarily concentrated in texas based on metered locations as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 16 million residential and 157000 small business customers making us the second largest mass market electricity provider in texas approximately 68 of our customers are in the houston area we also have customers in other texas cities including dallas ft worth and corpus christi 

in texas and the pjm market we market electricity and energy services to commercial industrial and governmentalinstitutional customers these customers include refineries chemical plants manufacturing facilities hospitals universities governmental agencies restaurants and other facilities based on metered locations as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 76000 commercial industrial and governmentalinstitutional customers 

under our supply strategy for our retail business we structure our supply portfolio to match our load demands by procuring sufficient power prior to or concurrent with entering into retail sales commitments following the initiation of our creditenhanced retail structure we are no longer required to post collateral for our texas retail supply purchases 

operations data 

 

1   these volumes include customers of the texas general land office for whom we provide services

2   the revenues and the related energy supply costs in our retail energy segment include our estimates of customer usage based on initial usage information provided by the independent system operators and the distribution companies we revise these estimates and record any changes in the period as additional settlement information becomes available collectively referred to as “market usage adjustments” these amounts represent the adjustments to volumes for market usage adjustments

wholesale energy 

as of december 31 2006 we owned had an interest in or leased 37 operating electric power generation facilities with an aggregate net generating capacity of 15935 mw in five regions of the united states the net generating capacity of these facilities consists of approximately 38 baseload 35 intermediate and 27 peaking capacity 

we sell electricity and energy services from our generation portfolio in hourahead dayahead forward bilateral and iso markets we sell these products to investorowned utilities municipalities cooperatives and other companies that serve end users or purchase power at wholesale for resale because our facilities are not subject to traditional costbased regulation we can generally sell electricity at marketdetermined prices the following table identifies the principal markets where we own lease or have under contract wholesale generation assets 

 

  

beginning june 1 2007 we expect that a substantial portion of our capacity that clears a pjm auction will be committed to the pjm market up to three years in advance revenue from these capacity sales will be determined by new market rules which are designed to ensure regional reliability encourage competition and reduce price volatility cal iso is considering similar reforms to its wholesale market rules in california which are currently expected to be implemented in early 2008 

to ensure adequate fuel supplies we contract for natural gas coal and fuel oil for our generation facilities for our natural gasfired plants we also arrange for schedule and balance natural gas from our suppliers and through transporting pipelines to perform these functions we lease natural gas transportation and storage capacity 

in february 2006 we completed an evaluation of our wholesale energy segment’s hedging strategy and use of capital as a result of our evaluation we substantially reduced hedging activity of our coal generation 

the following table describes our electric power generation facilities and net generating capacity by region as of december 31 2006 

 

1   we lease a 100 1667 and 1645 interest in three pennsylvania facilities having 572 mw 1711 mw and 1712 mw of net generating capacity respectively through facility lease agreements expiring in 2026 2034 and 2034 respectively the table includes our net share of the capacity of these facilities

2   we own a 50 interest in one of these facilities having a net generating capacity of 108 mw an unaffiliated party owns the other 50 the table includes our net share of the capacity of this facility

3   we are party to tolling agreements entitling us to 100 of the capacity of two florida facilities having 630 mw and 474 mw of net generating capacity respectively these tolling agreements expire in 2012 and 2007 respectively and are treated as operating leases for accounting purposes

regulation 

texas 

we are certified by the puct to provide retail electric service in texas we sell electricity in the competitive areas of ercot to residential and small business customers at unregulated prices until january 1 2007 we were required to make electricity available to houston area residential and small business customers at the puctapproved “pricetobeat” 

during 2006 approximately 528000 of our residential customers in houston selected one of our products other than the “pricetobeat” any residential “pricetobeat” customers who did not select an alternative product by december 31 2006 are now being served under our residential service plan 

in the january 2007 texas legislative session a number of electricityrelated bills have been filed that if passed could impact the retail electricity market in texas including the puct’s regulation of our activities 

in addition to the puct our activities in texas are subject to standards and regulations adopted by ercot see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k 

other states 

we operate electric generation facilities in regions administered by pjm cal iso and miso which operate under fercestablished tariffs and regulations in each of these regions the market rules include price limits or caps applicable to all generators in addition at the request of the local system operator we may be required to operate our plants at fixed prices or subject to temporary price caps to maintain reliability the isos also impose numerous other requirements relative to the manner in which we must operate our plants 

federal energy regulatory commission 

a number of our subsidiaries are public utilities under the federal power act and are subject to ferc rules and oversight regulations as public utilities these entities must sell power at either marketbased rates if marketbased rates authority has been granted by ferc or costbased rates each of our fercjurisdictional subsidiaries has been granted marketbased rate authority although a limited number of services sold by some of these entities are sold at costbased rates 

seasonality and competition 

the retail and wholesale energy industries are intensely competitive our competitors include merchant energy companies utilities retail electric service providers and other companies including in recent years companies owned by investment banking firms hedge funds and private equity funds our principal competitors in the retail electricity markets outside of houston are typically incumbent retail electric providers which have the advantage of longstanding relationships with customers in general competition in the retail and wholesale energy markets is on the basis of price service brand image and product offerings as well as market perceptions of creditworthiness for a discussion of how seasonality impacts our business and for additional information on the effect of competition see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k and note 17 to our consolidated financial statements 

environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local requirements relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of personnel and the public these requirements relate to a broad range of our activities including the discharge of compounds into the air water and soil the proper 

handling of solid hazardous and toxic materials and waste noise and safety and health standards applicable to the workplace 

based on existing regulations our market outlook and our current assessment of the costs of labor and materials and the state of evolving technologies we estimate that we will invest approximately 140 million in 2007 220 million in 2008 and 150 million to 430 million in 2009 through 2014 on projects to reduce our emission levels comply with existing regulations and lessen the environmental impact of our operations these amounts include 35 million for future ash landfill expansions from 2007 through 2014 as described below a significant amount of our expenditures relate to our election to upgrade the so 2 emissions controls at some of our facilities

in some cases which are described below environmental laws and regulations are pending are under consideration are in dispute or could be revised unless otherwise noted we cannot predict the ultimate effect of these matters on our business for additional information on how environmental matters may impact our business see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k and note 13b to our consolidated financial statements 

air quality 

under the clean air act the epa has implemented a number of emission control programs that affect industrial sources including power plants by limiting emissions of no x and so 2  no x and so 2 are precursors to the formation of acid rain fine particulate matter and regional haze no x is also a precursor to the formation of ozone

no x and so 2 emissions

in march 2005 the epa finalized a regulation referred to as the clean air interstate rule to further reduce emissions of no x and so 2 in the eastern united states in two phases the first phase which takes effect in 2009 for no x and 2010 for so 2  requires overall reductions within the area of approximately 50 in no x and so 2 emissions on an annual basis the second phase which takes effect in 2015 requires additional reductions of approximately 10 for a 60 total reduction in no x and approximately 15 for a 65 reduction in so 2  the epa regulations include the use of capandtrade programs to achieve these reductions

these regulations require us to provide an allowance for each ton of no x and so 2 that we emit under a capandtrade program as part of our effort to operate our business efficiently we concluded that since our generating assets dispatch based on market prices we should maintain an emission allowances inventory that corresponds with forward power sales we may sell excess emission allowances inventory if the price is equal to or above our fundamental view of the value of the allowances

we have undertaken studies to evaluate possible impacts of the clean air interstate rule and similar legislative and regulatory proposals which will primarily affect our coalfired facilities in the eastern united states based on an economic analysis that includes plant operability changes in the emission allowances market potential impact of stateimposed regulations and our preliminary estimates of capital expenditures we have elected to invest amounts ranging from approximately 340 million to 615 million through 2013 to principally reduce our emissions of so 2  we anticipate that these expenditures would be made over time with the majority of the expenditures being incurred in 2007 and 2008

mercury emissions 

in march 2005 the epa finalized the clean air mercury rule camr a national rule designed to reduce mercury emission from coal plants in two phases through a capandtrade system camr targets phase i reductions of approximately 30 in 2010 and phase ii reductions of approximately 70 in 2018 under camr states are permitted to adopt regulations that conform to camr or adopt their own 

mercury regulations that are stricter than those provided for in camr ohio has proposed regulations that generally conform to the federal camr standard several states including pennsylvania initiated litigation of camr in particular to require mercury control on a facility basis instead of through a capandtrade system the outcome of this litigation is uncertain but may impact our ultimate requirements to control mercury 

in late 2006 the pennsylvania department of environmental protection finalized stricter regulations for mercury emissions and several other states have done so or are considering doing so as well pennsylvania’s program generally requires mercury reductions on a facility basis in two phases with 80 reductions in 2010 and 90 reductions in 2015 our preliminary estimate of capital expenditures to comply with the first phase of the rules is approximately 45 million to 55 million for 2007 through 2009 our analysis and evaluation of alternatives for compliance with the second phase of this mercury control rule including potential capital expenditures for controls is underway 

air particulates 

in september 2006 the epa issued revised national ambient air quality standards for fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 25 microns or pm25 individual states must identify the sources of emissions in noncompliant areas and develop emission reduction plans these plans may be statespecific or regional in scope if our generating assets are located in areas that are not in compliance we could be required to take additional or accelerated steps to reduce our no x and so 2 emissions

greenhouse gas emissions 

there is an increased focus within the united states over the direction of domestic climate change policy several states primarily in the northeastern and coastal western united states are increasingly active in developing statespecific or regional regulatory initiatives to stimulate co 2 emission reductions in the electric power generation industry and other industries the united states congress is considering numerous bills that would impose mandatory limitation of co 2 and other greenhouse gas emissions for the domestic power generation sector the specific impact on our business will depend upon the form of emissionsrelated legislation or regulations ultimately adopted by the federal government or states in which our facilities are located in september 2006 california adopted legislation designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 25 below 1990 levels by 2020 this legislation requires the california air resources board to adopt regulations to become effective by 2012 which will limit emissions of greenhouse gases and provide for gradual reductions in emission levels to the 2020 limit

water quality 

in july 2004 the epa promulgated final regulations relating to the design and operation of cooling water intake structures at existing power plants in 2004 we initiated sitespecific evaluations to determine our practicable compliance options and the associated costs the epa developed facilityspecific cost assumptions that provide an interim means to benchmark our future compliance expenditures using these assumptions we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately 50 million between 2008 and 2010 however several environmental organizations and attorneys general of six northeastern states filed suit against the epa alleging the regulations are insufficient for protection of the state waters and fisheries in january 2007 the court responded by remanding the rule to the epa for substantial revisions as a result of the court decision and because of ongoing efforts in certain states including california to develop regulations that are more stringent than the federal regulations our cost estimates and the timing of any expenditures may change 

other 

as a result of their age many of our facilities contain significant amounts of asbestos insulation other asbestos containing materials as well as leadbased paint existing state and federal rules require the proper management and disposal of these potentially toxic materials we believe we properly manage and dispose of such materials in compliance with these state and federal rules see note 13b to our consolidated financial statements 

we do not believe we have any material liabilities or obligations under the comprehensive environmental response corporation and liability act of 1980 and similar state laws these laws impose clean up and restoration liability on owners and operators of facilities from or at which there has been a release or threatened release of hazardous substances together with those who have transported or arranged for the disposal of those substances 

employees 

as of december 31 2006 we had 3524 fulltime and parttime employees of these employees 1112 are covered by collective bargaining agreements which expire on various dates from april 2007 through october 2011 the following table sets forth the number of our employees by business segment as of december 31 2006

 item 1a   risk factors  

risks related to the retail and wholesale energy industries 

the financial results of our wholesale and retail energy segments are subject to market risks beyond our control 

our results of operations financial condition and cash flows are significantly impacted by the prevailing demand and market prices for electricity purchased power fuel and emission allowances over which we have no control market prices can fluctuate dramatically in response to many factors including weather conditions changes in the prices of related commodities changes in law and regulation regulatory intervention including the imposition of price limitations bidding rules or similar mechanisms market illiquidity transmission constraints environmental limitations generation unit outages fuel supply issues and other events 

the markets in which we operate are relatively immature markets that are characterized by elements of both deregulated and regulated markets changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate could adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of conducting our business 

we operate in a regulatory environment that is undergoing varying restructuring initiatives in many instances the regulatory structures governing the electricity markets are still evolving creating gaps in the regulatory framework and associated uncertainty in addition existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to our facilities or our commercial activities we cannot predict the future direction of these initiatives or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on our business consequently future regulatory restrictions regulatory or political intervention or changes in laws and regulations may constrain our ability to set rates at market prices or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business see “business—regulation” in item 1 of this form 10k 

we depend on sources facilities and systems that we do not own or control for our fuel and fuel supply and to deliver electricity to and bill our customers any disruption in these sources facilities or systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

we depend on fuel sources and fuel supply facilities owned and operated by third parties to supply our generation plants and power transmission distribution facilities and metering systems owned and operated by third parties to deliver electricity to our customers and provide energy usage data if these sources facilities or systems fail we may be unable to generate andor deliver electricity in addition inaccurate or untimely information from third parties could hinder our ability to bill customers and collect amounts owed 

the operation of generation facilities involves significant risks that could interrupt operations and increase our costs 

ownership of generation assets exposes us to risks relating to the breakdown of equipment or processes fuel supply or transportation interruptions shortages of equipment material and labor operational restrictions resulting from environmental limitations and governmental interventions as well as other operational risks in addition many of our facilities are old and require significant maintenance expenditures we are party to collective bargaining agreements with labor unions at several of our plants 

if our workers were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown other employees were to become unionized or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated we could experience a significant disruption in our operations and higher ongoing labor costs similarly we have an aging workforce at a number of our plants creating potential knowledge and expertise gaps as those workers retire if we are unable to secure fuel we will not be able to run our generation units if a generation unit fails we may have to purchase replacement power from third parties at higher prices we have insurance subject to limits and deductibles covering some types of physical damage and business interruption related to our generation units however this insurance may not always be available on commercially reasonable terms in addition there is no assurance that insurance proceeds will be sufficient to cover all losses insurance payments will be timely made or the policies themselves will be free of substantial deductibles 

our business operations expose us to the risk of loss if third parties fail to perform their contractual obligations 

we may incur losses if third parties default on their contractual obligations such as obligations to pay us money buy or sell electricity fuel emission allowances and other commodities or provide us with fuel transportation services power transmission or distribution services for additional information about third party default risk including our efforts to mitigate against this risk see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—credit risk” in item 7 of this form 10k and note 2e to our consolidated financial statements 

our costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant and can affect our future financial results 

our wholesale energy segment is subject to extensive and evolving environmental regulations particularly our coal and oilfired generation units we incur significant costs in complying with these regulations and if we fail to comply could incur significant penalties our cost estimates for compliance with environmental regulations are based on our current assessment of the cost of labor and materials and the state of evolving technologies changes to the preceding factors revisions of environmental regulations litigation and new legislation andor regulations as well as other factors could cause our actual costs to vary outside the range of our estimates in addition failure to comply with environmental requirements could require us to shut down or reduce production on our generation units or create liability exposure new environmental laws or regulations may be adopted that would further constrain our operations or increase our environmental compliance costs we also may be responsible for the environmental liabilities associated with generation units even if a prior owner caused the liabilities we are required to purchase emission allowances to operate some of our facilities such allowances may be unavailable or only available at costs that would make it uneconomic to operate our generating assets see “business—environmental matters” in item 1 of this form 10k and note 13b to our consolidated financial statements 

failure to obtain or maintain any required permits or approvals could prevent or limit us from operating our business 

to operate our generating units and retail electric business we must obtain and maintain various permits licenses approvals and certificates from governmental agencies in some jurisdictions we must also meet minimum requirements for customer service and comply with local consumer protection and other laws our failure to obtain or maintain any necessary governmental permits or licenses or to satisfy these legal requirements including environmental compliance provisions could limit our ability to operate our business or create liability exposure 

significant events beyond our control such as hurricanes and other weatherrelated problems or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

the uncertainty associated with events beyond our control such as significant weather events and the risk of future terrorist activity may affect our results of operations and financial condition in unpredictable ways these events could result in adverse changes in the insurance markets and disruptions of power and fuel markets in addition terrorist actions could damage or shut down our generation facilities or the fuel and fuel supply facilities or the power transmission and distribution facilities upon which our generation and retail businesses are dependent these events could also adversely affect the united states economy create instability in the financial markets and as a result have an adverse effect on our ability to access capital on terms and conditions acceptable to us 

risks relating to our texas retail operations 

merrill lynch provides credit support for our texas retail business 

in december 2006 our new creditenhanced retail structure became effective under the terms of the agreement merrill lynch  co inc and an affiliate merrill lynch provides guarantees and posts collateral for the supply purchases and related transactions of our texas retail energy business if we do not comply with the material terms of our agreement merrill lynch could terminate its future obligations to provide guarantees and collateral postings on our behalf in this event our ability to operate our texas retail business could be impaired which would adversely affect our liquidity cash flows and financial performance 

we depend on third parties to provide electricity to supply our texas retail customers 

we own a very limited amount of generation capacity in texas which is insufficient to supply the electricity requirements of our texas retail operations we purchase substantially all of our texas supply requirements from third parties as a result our financial performance depends on our ability to obtain adequate supplies of electric generation from third parties at prices below the prices we charge our customers 

initiatives undertaken by the puct may negatively impact the wholesale cost of power 

in 2006 the puct implemented a new rule on resource adequacy and market power in the ercot region in this rule the puct increased the current price cap applicable to generation offers into the ercot energy market eliminated current market power mitigation measures and adopted new market power guidelines if a market participant commits market power abuse and it is not adequately mitigated such abuse would have the impact of increasing the wholesale cost of power which could adversely impact our gross margins in the texas retail market 

rising power supply costs could adversely affect the financial performance of our texas retail electric operations 

our earnings could be adversely affected in any period in which our power supply costs rise at a greater rate than our rates charged to customers the price of our power supply purchases associated with our energy commitments can be different than that reflected in the rates charged to customers due to 

·   varying supply procurement contracts used and the timing of entering into related contracts

·   subsequent changes in the overall price of natural gas

·   daily monthly or seasonal fluctuations in the price of natural gas relative to the 12month forward prices

·   changes in market heat rate ie the relationship between power and natural gas prices and

·   other factors

we may lose further market share in the houston retail electricity market which is a significant contributor of income to our consolidated results 

in recent years we have experienced declines in our share of the houston retail electricity market which represents approximately 67 of our residential customer base this trend could continue if competition increases in addition the new competitive market has attracted a number of new participants the emergence of larger aggressive competitors may put downward pressure on our houston sales volumes and margins over time see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—business overview” in item 7 of this form 10k 

our ability to set rates at market prices in texas may be constrained by new legislative restrictions 

the texas legislature is studying the effects of competition in the texas retail electricity market although we were no longer obligated to make electricity available to houston area customers at the “pricetobeat” rate as of january 1 2007 new legislation or rules governing the retail electricity market including prices we are allowed to charge and the possibility of our customers being transferred to another provider could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we depend on the ercot iso to communicate operating and system information in a timely and accurate manner corrections to prior estimated billing and other information can have an impact on our future reported financial results 

the ercot iso communicates information relating to a customer’s choice of retail electric provider and other data needed for servicing of customer accounts to utilities and retail electric providers any failure to perform these tasks will result in delays and other problems in enrolling switching and billing customers the ercot iso is also responsible for settling all electricity supply volumes in the ercot region information that is not accurate or timely may result in incorrect estimates of our settled volumes and supply costs that would need to be corrected when such information is received see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—new accounting pronouncements significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates—critical accounting estimates” in item 7 of this form 10k 

we could be liable for a share of the payment defaults of other retail electric providers within the ercot market 

if a retail electric provider defaults on its payment obligations to ercot we together with other ercot market participants are liable for a portion of the defaulted amount based on our respective share of the total load as of december 31 2006 we accounted for approximately 20 of the total ercot load in addition the emergence of smaller less wellcapitalized entities may impose costs and burdens on market participants such as us if they default on their obligations to the market 

risks related to our company 

our borrowing levels debt service obligations and restrictive covenants may adversely affect our business we are vulnerable to reductions in our cash flow 

as of december 31 2006 we had total gross debt of 35 billion 

·   we must dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to pay debt service requirements which reduces the amount of cash available for other business purposes

·   the covenants in our debt agreements and in our agreement with merrill lynch restrict our ability to among other things obtain additional financing make investments or acquisitions create additional liens on our assets and take other actions to react to changes in our business

·   if we do not comply with the payment and other material covenants including the financial ratios under our debt agreements our debt holders could require us to repay our debt immediately and in the case of our revolving credit facilities terminate their commitment to lend us money

·   so long as our credit ratios remain at historical levels and substantially all our assets are pledged to secure repayment of our debt we are unlikely to obtain an investment grade credit rating

·   our debt levels and credit ratings may affect the evaluation of our creditworthiness by customers which could put us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors with less debt and

·   we may be more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions including changes in shortterm interest rates

if we were unable to generate sufficient cash flows access funds from operations or raise cash from other sources we would not be able to meet our debt service and other obligations these situations could result from adverse developments in the energy fuel or capital markets a disruption in our operations or those of third parties or other events adversely affecting our cash flows and financial performance 

our hedging and other risk management activities may not work as planned 

our hedges may not be effective as a result of basis price differences transmission issues price correlation volume variations or other factors see “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about nontrading and trading activities and related market risks” in item 7a of this form 10k 

changes in the wholesale energy market or sales of generation assets could result in impairments 

if our outlook for the wholesale energy market changes negatively or if our ongoing evaluation of our wholesale energy segment results in decisions to mothball retire or dispose of generation assets we could have impairment charges related to goodwill or our fixed assets see notes 2h and 2i to our consolidated financial statements 

lawsuits and regulatory proceedings could adversely affect our business 

from time to time we are named as a party to lawsuits and regulatory proceedings litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain any claim that is successfully asserted against us could result in significant damage claims and other losses even if we were to prevail any litigation could be costly and timeconsuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows see notes 13 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements  

we have entered into outsourcing arrangements with third party service providers in addition our operations are highly dependent on computer and other operating systems including telecommunications systems any interruptions in these arrangements or systems could significantly disrupt our business operations 

in recent years we have entered into outsourcing arrangements such as information technology production software infrastructure and development and certain functions within customer operations with third party service providers if these service providers do not perform their obligations we may incur significant costs and experience interruptions in our business operations in connection with switching to other service providers or assuming these obligations ourselves we are also highly dependent on our specialized computer and communications systems the operation of which could be interrupted by fire flood power loss computer viruses and similar disruptions although we have some backup systems and disaster recovery plans there is no guarantee that these systems and plans will be effective 

if we acquire or develop additional generation assets or dispose of existing generation assets we may incur additional costs and risks 

we may seek to purchase or develop additional generation units or dispose of existing generation units there is no assurance that our efforts to identify and acquire additional generation units or to dispose of existing generation assets will be successful in the sale of generation units we may be required to indemnify a purchaser against certain liabilities to finance future acquisitions we may be required to issue additional equity securities or incur additional debt

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

business overview 

our objective is to be a leader in delivering the benefits of competitive electricity markets to customers our business focuses on the competitive segments of both the retail and wholesale electricity markets 

in 2006 we have substantially completed the process begun in 2003 to reposition our business for future success as part of this process we reduced debt and improved our liquidity position by utilizing cash flows from the business proceeds from a series of asset sales and the implementation of a creditenhanced retail structure this new structure reduced our collateral requirements and the liquidity risk associated with commodity price volatility we streamlined processes and reduced operating costs while shifting our focus away from energy trading to an assetperformance culture additionally we improved the percentage of time that our generating assets were available to run economically to 851 compared to 793 in 2004 we resolved a significant amount of legacy litigation improved corporate governance and provided transparency into the earnings drivers of our business by introducing the open wholesale reporting model in our retail business we established a leadership position and transitioned to a fully competitive retail market in texas with a significant portion of our former “pricetobeat” customers selecting one of our longerterm and innovative new products we believe these accomplishments position us to emerge as a leader in competitive electricity markets 

going forward our strategy is based on core beliefs about the power industry and the retail and wholesale electricity markets these core beliefs reflect the issues we believe are the primary determinants of valuecreation and risk our core beliefs about the power industry are 

·   volatile and uncertain markets drive variable earnings profiles

·   there will be a mix of competitive and regulated markets with a slow evolution to competition and

·   environmental issues will command an increasing focus from regulators and politicians 

we are committed to delivering superior returns from competitive markets through insights into the fundamentals of our core markets and a commitment to riskweighted investments whose return on invested capital exceeds our weightedaverage cost of capital 

retail energy   the retail energy segment is a low capital investment electricity resale business with relatively stable earnings excluding unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives the key earnings drivers in the retail energy segment are the volume of electricity we sell to customers the unit margins received on those sales and the cost of acquiring and serving those customers we earn a margin by selling electricity to enduse customers and simultaneously acquiring supply shortterm earnings in this business are impacted by local weather patterns and the competitive tactics of other retailers in the market the longerterm earnings drivers of the business are the level of competitive intensity and our ability to retain and grow market share by having a strong brand and excellent customer service

our core beliefs about the retail market are 

·   we have a leadership position in the competitive electricity retail business which has a high return on invested capital and relatively stable earnings

·   retail competition provides opportunities to add value through customer segmentation product and service innovation and brand

·   the confluence of market forces will provide an opportunity to dramatically alter industry load and

·   continued success in the texas retail market will drive new competitive market openings

these core beliefs set the stage for our strategic direction looking forward we will focus on the following valuecreation levers 

·   strengthening our leadership position in ercot by continuing to build and exercise our operating capabilities using customer segmentation to identify and provide valueadded products and services providing superior customer service building our brand and developing product and service innovations

·   entering and developing new competitive markets and

·   leading the development of smart energy to reshape customer load

wholesale energy   the wholesale energy segment is a capitalintensive cyclical business earnings are significantly impacted by the level of natural gas prices and spark spreads the key earnings drivers are the amount of electricity we generate and the margin we earn for each unit of electricity sold we do not control those factors that have the most significant impact on our earnings levels the factor that we have the most control over is the percentage of time that our generating assets are available to run when it is economic for them to do so shortterm earnings in our wholesale business are impacted by weather and commodity price volatility longerterm earnings are driven by the level of commodity prices and regional supply and demand fundamentals

our core beliefs about the wholesale market are 

·   capital intensive cyclical industries generally earn returns below their cost of capital over a full cycle

·   new build investment typically under earns its cost of capital unless there is a significant cost advantage and

·   over the next several years we anticipate a significant supplydemand recovery

these core beliefs set the stage for our strategic direction looking forward we will focus on the following valuecreation levers 

·   realizing the value uplift from anticipated improving supply and demand fundamentals in the wholesale markets from our existing portfolio of assets

·   achieving operating and commercial excellence and

·   utilizing a highlydisciplined capital investment process with a return on invested capital focus to monetize the value of our brownfield sites acquire assets at discounts to replacements and divest nonstrategic assets

companywide   building on our success in repositioning the company and our rapidly improving credit profile we will focus on establishing a flexible capital structure that ensures a competitive cost of capital with an ability to invest in value creating opportunities including returning capital to shareholders in addition we will continue to develop innovative structures and transactions that improve returns and reduce risk

we also believe that stockholder value is enhanced through the development of a highly motivated and customerfocused work force we continue to focus on a series of actions designed to build a “great company to work for” including a communicating openly with our employees b fostering company pride among our employees c providing a satisfying and safe work environment d recognizing and rewarding employee contributions and capabilities and e motivating our employees to be collaborative leaders committed to our future 

our ability to achieve these strategic objectives and execute these actions is subject to a number of factors some of which we may not be able to control see “cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information” and “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k 

consolidated results of operations 

the following discussion includes nongaap financial measures which are not standardized therefore it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names we strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure 

2006 compared to 2005 and 2005 compared to 2004 

we reported 328 million consolidated net loss or 107 loss per share for 2006 compared to 331 million consolidated net loss or 109 loss per share for 2005 and 29 million consolidated net loss or 010 loss per share for 2004 

 

  

retail energy segment 

our retail energy segment’s contribution margin was 250 million in 2006 compared to 342 million in 2005 the 92 million decrease in contribution margin was primarily due to the increase in unrealized losses on energy derivatives of 218 million in addition contribution margin was impacted by a 232 million increase in gross margin excluding unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives and a 106 million increase in operation and maintenance selling and marketing and bad debt expense our retail energy segment’s contribution margin was 342 million in 2005 compared to 377 million in 2004 the 35 million decrease in contribution margin was primarily due to a 249 million decrease in gross margin excluding unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives contribution margin was positively impacted by the 203 million net change in unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives and an 11 million decrease in operation and maintenance selling and marketing and bad debt expense see “—retail energy margins” below for explanations 

in analyzing the results of our retail energy segment we use the nongaap financial measure “retail energy gross margin excluding unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives” as well as contribution margin and retail energy gross margin retail energy gross margin excluding unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures the item that is excluded from retail energy gross margin excluding unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives has a recurring effect on our earnings and reflects aspects of our business that are not taken into account by this measure 

unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives   we use derivative instruments to manage operational or market constraints and to execute our retail energy segment’s supply procurement strategy we are required to record in our consolidated statement of operations noncash gainslosses related to future periods based on current changes in forward commodity prices for derivative instruments receiving marktomarket accounting treatment we refer to these gains and losses prior to settlement as well as ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges as “unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives” in some cases the underlying transactions being hedged receive accrual accounting treatment resulting in a mismatch of accounting treatments since the application of marktomarket accounting has the effect of pulling forward into current periods noncash gainslosses relating to future delivery periods analysis of results of operations from one period to another can be difficult we believe that excluding these unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives provides a more meaningful representation of our economic performance in the reporting period and is therefore useful to us investors analysts and others in facilitating the analysis of our results of operations from one period to another

retail energy revenues 

 

  

  1 increase primarily due to increases in unit sales prices to customers partially offset by lower volumes due to fewer customers milder weather and reduced customer usage

  2 increase primarily due to increases in unit sales prices to customers partially offset by lower volumes due to fewer customers

  3 increase primarily due to a increases in unit sales prices to customers and b increased volumes due to increased customers

  4 increase primarily due to a increased volumes due to increased customers and b increases in unit sales prices to customers

  5 increase primarily due to increases in unit sales prices to customers

  6 decrease primarily due to lower volumes due to fewer customers and reduced customer usage partially offset by increases in unit sales prices to customers

  7 increase primarily due to a increased volumes due to increased customers and b increases in unit sales prices to customers these increases were partially offset by reduced customer usage

  8 increase primarily due to a increased volume due to increased customers and b increases in unit sales prices

  9 increase primarily due to a fixed price contracts renewed at higher market rates due to higher prices of electricity when the contracts were executed b variable rate contracts which are tied to the market price of natural gas and c increased volumes

  10 increase primarily due to a fixed price contracts renewed at higher market rates due to higher prices of electricity when the contracts were executed and b variable rate contracts which are tied to the market price of natural gas these increases were partially offset by decreased volumes

  11 decrease primarily due to lower volumes due to fewer customers this decrease was partially offset by increases primarily due to a fixed price contracts renewed at higher market rates due to higher prices of electricity when the contracts were executed and b variable rate contracts which are tied to the market price of natural gas

  12 increase primarily due to a increased volumes due to market entry in maryland and other pjm markets in 2004 b fixed price contracts renewed at higher market rates due to higher prices of electricity when the contracts were executed and c variable rate contracts which are tied to the market price of natural gas

  13 increase primarily due to our supply management activities in various markets in texas

  14 see footnote 5 under “retail energy margins”

retail energy purchased power 

 

  

1   increase primarily due to higher unit prices of purchased power

2   decrease primarily due to lower prices and volumes

3   increase primarily due to higher volumes

5   see footnote 6 under “retail energy margins”

6   see footnote 7 under “retail energy margins”

retail energy margins 

 

  

  1 unit margins increased primarily due to increases in unit sales prices to customers this increase was partially offset by higher unit prices of purchased power

  2 unit margins decreased primarily due to a higher unit prices of purchased power and b higher transmission and distribution losses in ercot these decreases were partially offset by increases in unit sales prices to customers

  3 unit margins increased primarily due to increases in unit sales prices to customers partially offset by higher unit prices of purchased power

  4 unit margins decreased primarily due to a higher unit prices of purchased power and b higher transmission and distribution losses in ercot these decreases were partially offset by increases in unit sales prices to customers

  5 the revenues and the related energy supply costs in our retail energy segment include our estimates of customer usage based on initial usage information provided by the independent system operators and the distribution companies we revise these estimates and record any changes in the period as additional settlement information becomes available collectively referred to as “market usage adjustments”

  6 decrease primarily due to a 139 million loss due to cash flow hedge ineffectiveness and b 102 million loss due to the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains resulting from the termination of commodity contracts with a counterparty these decreases were partially offset by 85 million gain due to settlements

  7 increase primarily due to a 198 million gain due to settlements and b 75 million gain due to cash flow hedge ineffectiveness these increases were partially offset by 122 million loss due to changes in prices on our derivatives marked to market

  8 increase primarily due to a 26 million in gross receipts tax due to higher billings and b 12 million due to increase in contract services and professional fees

  9 decrease primarily due to decrease in salaries and benefits

  10 increase primarily due to additional marketing campaigns

  11 increase primarily due to higher customer defaults in 2006 primarily due to increases in unit sales prices to customers

  12 increase primarily due to an increase in revenues

wholesale energy segment 

our wholesale energy segment’s contribution margin was 146 million in 2006 compared to 110 million in 2005 the 36 million increase in contribution margin was primarily due to net change in unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives of 179 million and a reduced negative effect of historical wholesale hedges of 108 million in addition contribution margin was impacted by a 199 million decrease in open wholesale gross margin and a 55 million increase in operation and maintenance expenses our wholesale energy segment’s contribution margin was 110 million in 2005 compared to 247 million in 2004 the 137 million decrease in contribution margin was primarily due to a 534 million negative effect of historical wholesale hedges and a 171 million net change in unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives in addition contribution margin was impacted by a 532 million increase in open wholesale gross margin and a 16 million decrease in operation and maintenance expenses see “—wholesale energy margins” below for explanations 

in analyzing the results of our wholesale energy segment we use the nongaap financial measures “open energy gross margin” and “open wholesale gross margin” which exclude the items described below as well as contribution margin and wholesale energy gross margin open energy gross margin and open wholesale gross margin should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures the items that are excluded from open energy gross margin and open wholesale gross margin have or have had a recurring effect on our earnings and reflect aspects of our business that are not taken into account by these measures 

unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives   we use derivative instruments to manage operational or market constraints and to increase the return on our generation assets we are required to record in our consolidated statement of operations noncash gainslosses related to future periods based on current changes in forward commodity prices for derivative instruments receiving marktomarket accounting treatment we refer to these gains and losses prior to settlement as well as ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges as “unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives” in some cases the underlying transactions being hedged receive accrual accounting treatment resulting in a mismatch of accounting treatments since the application of marktomarket accounting has the effect of pulling forward into current periods noncash gainslosses relating to future delivery periods analysis of results of operations from one period to another can be difficult we believe that excluding these unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives provides a more meaningful representation of our economic performance in the reporting period and is therefore useful to us investors analysts and others in facilitating the analysis of our results of operations from one period to another these gainslosses are also not a function of the operating performance of our generation assets and excluding their impact helps isolate the operating performance of our generation assets under prevailing market conditions

historical wholesale hedges   we exclude the effect of certain historical although recurring until the contracts terminate wholesale hedges that were entered into in order to hedge the economics of our wholesale operations we believe that it is useful to us investors analysts and others to show our results in the absence of these hedges the impact of these historical hedges on our financial results is not a function of the operating performance of our generation assets and excluding the impact better reflects the operating performance of our generation assets based on prevailing market conditions

changes in californiarelated receivables and reserves   we excluded the impact of changes in receivables and reserves relating to energy sales in california from october 2000 through june 2001 we reached a settlement concerning these receivables during the third quarter of 2005 because of the market conditions and regulatory events that underlie the changes in these receivables and reserves we believe that excluding this item provides a more meaningful representation of our results of operations on an ongoing basis and is therefore useful to us investors analysts and others in facilitating the analysis of our results of operations from one period to another for additional information see note 14a to our consolidated financial statements

wholesale energy revenues 

 

1   decrease primarily due a lower natural gas sales prices related to gas transportation contracts and b lower contracted power sales prices these decreases were partially offset by an increase in natural gas and power sales volumes

2   increase primarily due to a 248 million due to certain gas transactions which prior to april 1 2004 were recorded net as a part of the trading activity and are now recorded gross in revenues and purchased power fuel and cost of gas sold b increase in natural gas prices and volumes related to gas transportation contracts these increases were partially offset by lower contracted power sales prices and power sales volumes

3   decrease primarily due to lower prices and volumes

4   increase primarily due to higher volumes due to more retail energy segment sales in the pjm market

5   see footnote 19 under “wholesale energy margins”

6   see footnote 20 under “wholesale energy margins”

wholesale energy purchased power fuel and cost of gas sold 

 

1   decrease primarily due to a lower prices paid for natural gas and purchased power and b decreased oil volumes these decreases were partially offset by a increased purchased gas volumes and b higher contracted prices of coal

2   increase primarily due to a 254 million due to certain gas transactions which prior to april 1 2004 were recorded net as part of the trading activity and are now recorded gross in revenues and purchased power fuel and cost of gas sold see footnote 2 under “wholesale energy revenues” b higher prices paid for natural gas oil and coal and c increased volumes of natural gas and coal purchased

3   see footnote 19 under “wholesale energy margins”

4   see footnote 20 under “wholesale energy margins”

wholesale energy margins 

 

  1 open energy gross margin is calculated using the power sales prices received by the plants less delivered spot fuel prices this figure excludes the effects of our historical wholesale hedges and prices actually paid for fuel

  2 decrease primarily due to lower unit margins lower power prices partially offset by lower coal costs this decrease was partially offset by improved commercial capacity factor

  3 increase primarily due to a higher unit margins higher power prices and b increased economic generation driven by seward achieving commercial operation in october 2004 versus full year in 2005

  4 decrease primarily due to lower unit margins lower power prices partially offset by lower coal costs

  5 increase primarily due to a higher unit margins higher power prices due to “provider of last resort” contracts that were priced lower than market ending in the fourth quarter of 2004 and b higher commercial capacity factor due to plant availability these increases were partially offset by lower economic generation due to the shift from a “full requirements” model in 2004 to a “marketbased” model in 2005

  6 increase primarily due to a higher unit margins higher power prices partially offset by higher fuel costs and b higher economic generation due to improved market conditions in 2005

  7 increase primarily due to higher unit margins lower fuel costs partially offset by lower power prices and increased economic generation these increases were partially offset by lower commercial capacity factor

  8 decrease primarily due to lower unit margins higher fuel costs partially offset by higher power prices

  9 decrease primarily due to lower unit margins lower power prices partially offset by lower fuel costs

  10 other margin represents power purchase agreements capacity payments and ancillary revenues in addition other margin includes settlement of forward power and fuel sales and purchases for the west region

  11 decrease primarily due to lower gains on hedge sales resulting from higher spot prices which created less favorable market conditions in 2006 compared to 2005 for the selective hedge strategies executed

  12 increase primarily due to additional volumes under power purchase agreements in 2005

  13 increase primarily due to a indian river being under a power purchase agreement for nine months in 2005 compared to a full year in 2006 and b osceola contracting additional volumes under a power purchase agreement in the second quarter of 2006

  14 decrease primarily due to a lower unit margins and b lower economic generation these decreases were partially offset with improved commercial capacity factor in the pjm and miso regions

  15 increase primarily due to a higher unit margins b higher economic generation and c improved commercial capacity factor

  16 historical wholesale hedges were entered into to primarily hedge the economics of our wholesale operations these amounts primarily relate to settlements of forward power and fuel hedges longterm tolling purchases longterm natural gas transportation contracts storage contracts and our legacy energy trading these amounts are derived based on methodology consistent with the calculation of open energy gross margin

  17 increase primarily due to a 387 million decrease in losses from power sales resulting from a 41 decrease in hedged volumes and 55 decrease in the average loss on hedges reduced by 187 million of losses on 2006 power hedges closed in the third quarter of 2005 this increase was partially offset by 98 million due to a decrease of coal market prices combined with an increase in coal contract prices

  18 decrease due to unfavorable differences between prices received by our coal plants and settlement prices on our hedged power sales

  19 increase primarily due to a 113 million gain due to settlements and b 74 million gain due to changes in prices on our derivatives marked to market

  20 decrease primarily due to a 89 million loss due to changes in prices on our derivatives marked to market and b 80 million loss from dedesignated hedge positions

  21 increase primarily due to 46 million increase in planned outages and maintenance spending primarily at our coal plants

  22 decrease primarily due to a 18 million decrease in taxes other than income primarily due to the resolution of potential tax liabilities in 2005 b 7 million decrease in salaries and benefits excluding plant personnel c 7 million decrease as a result of the termination of certain services to texas genco holdings inc and its subsidiaries in may 2004 and d 6 million decrease in severance these decreases were partially offset by a 21 million increase in expense due to bighorn and seward plants achieving commercial operations in february 2004 and october 2004 respectively

other general and administrative 

 

1   increase primarily due to impact of increased stock price on stockbased incentive plan expense

liquidity and capital resources 

sources of liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations borrowings net proceeds from asset sales and securities offerings for a description of factors that could affect our liquidity and capital resources see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k and the discussion of restrictive covenants in notes 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

during 2006 we generated 13 billion in operating cash flows from continuing operations including the changes in margin deposits of 13 billion and 160 million in payments relating to the western states and cornerstone settlements the change in margin deposits was primarily due to a our creditenhanced retail structure and b the expiration of certain hedges consistent with our objective of reducing wholesale generation hedges in addition we received 182 million of net proceeds from sales of emission allowances 

the december 2006 refinancings related to the creditenhanced retail structure included a reducing the size of our revolving credit facility from 17 billion to 700 million b issuing a new 300 million letter of credit facility c reducing our aggregate term loan balances from 530 million to 400 million d terminating our 450 million receivables securitization facility and e entering into a 300 million retail working capital facility in february and march 2006 we used net proceeds of 952 million relating to the sale of our new york plants to pay down debt 

as of february 15 2007 we had total available liquidity of 15 billion comprised of unused borrowing capacity letters of credit capacity and cash and cash equivalents 

liquidity and capital requirements 

our liquidity and capital requirements primarily reflect our working capital needs capital expenditures debt service and collateral requirements examples of working capital needs include purchases of fuel and electricity purchases of emission allowances plant maintenance costs including environmental expenditures and corporate costs such as payroll settlement costs associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings can also have a significant impact on our liquidity and cash requirements for settlements see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements 

collateral posting requirements have been significantly reduced due to our creditenhanced retail structure see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2006 we had total collateral postings of 814 million which includes 361 million of letters of credit which is a 18 billion decrease from december 31 2005 we retain collateral posting obligations for our wholesale energy segment and certain other activities the collateral amounts fluctuate depending on commodity prices price volatility levels of hedging activity seasonality and other factors including changes in our perceived credit standing as of february 15 2007 we had total collateral postings of 784 million which is a 30 million decrease from december 31 2006 due primarily to the expiration of certain historical wholesale hedges 

we are considering transferring our interest in channelview together with its debt of 342 million see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements

contingencies and guarantees   we are involved in a number of legal environmental and other proceedings before courts and are subject to ongoing investigations by certain governmental agencies that could negatively impact our liquidity see notes 11e and 13 to our consolidated financial statements

we also enter into guarantee and indemnification arrangements in the normal course of business none of which is expected to materially impact our liquidity see note 12b to our consolidated financial statements 

credit risk 

by extending credit to our counterparties we are exposed to credit risk for a discussion of our credit risk and policy see note 2e to our consolidated financial statements

new accounting pronouncements 

see notes 2 10b and 11f to our consolidated financial statements 

significant accounting policies 

see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates 

we make a number of estimates and judgments in preparing our consolidated financial statements these estimates can differ from actual results and have a significant impact on our recorded assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we consider an estimate to be a critical accounting estimate if it requires a high level of subjectivity or judgment and a significant change in the estimate would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations each critical accounting estimate affects both our retail energy and wholesale energy segments unless indicated otherwise the audit committee of our board of directors reviews each critical accounting estimate with our senior management further discussion of these accounting policies and estimates is in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

goodwill 

we consider the estimate of fair value to be a critical accounting estimate for our wholesale energy segment because a a goodwill impairment could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and b the estimate is based on a number of highly subjective judgments and assumptions see notes 2i and 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

property plant and equipment 

we consider the fair value estimate used to calculate impairment of property plant and equipment a critical accounting estimate this estimate primarily affects our wholesale energy segment which holds approximately 98 of our total net property plant and equipment see note 2h to our consolidated financial statements in determining the existence of an impairment in carrying value we make a number of subjective assumptions as to 

·   whether there is an indication of impairment

·   the grouping of assets

·   the intention of “holding” versus “selling” an asset

·   the forecast of undiscounted expected future cash flow over the asset’s estimated useful life and

·   if an impairment exists the fair value of the asset or asset group

derivative assets and liabilities 

we report our derivative assets and liabilities for which the normal purchasenormal sale exception has not been made at fair value and consider it to be a critical accounting estimate because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period and are dependent on many subjective factors including 

·   estimated forward market price curves

·   valuation adjustments relating to time value

·   liquidity valuation adjustments

·   costs of administering future obligations under existing contracts and

·   credit adjustments based on estimated defaults by counterparties

to determine the fair value for energy derivatives where there are no market quotes or external valuation services we rely on various modeling techniques there is inherent risk in valuation modeling given the complexity and volatility of energy markets therefore it is possible that results in future periods may be materially different as contracts are ultimately settled 

for additional information regarding our derivative assets and liabilities see notes 2d and 5 to our consolidated financial statements and “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about nontrading and trading activities and related market risks” in item 7a of this form 10k 

retail energy segment estimated revenues and energy supply costs 

accrued unbilled revenues   accrued unbilled revenues of 416 million as of december 31 2006 represented 4 of our consolidated revenues and 5 of our retail energy segment’s revenues for 2006 accrued unbilled revenues of 400 million as of december 31 2005 represented 4 of our consolidated revenues and 6 of our retail energy segment’s revenues for 2005

accrued unbilled revenues are critical accounting estimates as volumes and rates are not precisely known at the end of each reporting period and the revenue amounts are material if our estimate of electricity usage were to increase or decrease by 3 our accrued unbilled revenues as of december 31 2006 would have increased or decreased by approximately 13 million 

estimated energy supply costs   we record energy supply costs for electricity sales and services to retail customers based on estimated supply volumes and an estimated rate per mwh for the applicable reporting period this is a critical accounting estimate as volumes and rates are not known at the end of each reporting period and the purchased power amounts are material

a portion of our energy supply costs 61 million and 53 million as of december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively consisted of estimated transmission and distribution charges not yet billed by the transmission and distribution utilities 

in estimating supply volumes we consider the effects of historical customer volumes weather factors and usage by customer class we estimate our transmission and distribution delivery fees using the same method that we use for electricity sales and services to retail customers in addition we estimate ercot iso fees based on historical trends estimated supply volumes and initial ercot iso settlements volume estimates are then multiplied by the estimated rate and recorded as purchased power in the applicable reporting period if our estimate of electricity usage volumes increased or decreased by 3 our energy supply costs would have increased or decreased by approximately 12 million as of december 31 2006 changes in our volume usage would have resulted in a similar offsetting change in billed volumes thus partially mitigating our energy supply costs 

dependence on ercot iso settlement procedures   preliminary settlement information is due from the ercot iso within two months after electricity is delivered final settlement information is due from the ercot iso within six months after electricity is delivered the six month settlement received from ercot is considered final as ercot will only resettle if there are data errors greater than 2 of that day’s transaction dollars or if alternate dispute resolutions are granted we record our estimated supply costs and related fees using estimated supply volumes as discussed above and adjust those costs upon receipt of the ercot iso information delays in settlements could materially affect the accuracy of our recorded energy supply costs and related fees

market usage adjustments   the revenues and the related energy supply costs in our retail energy segment include our estimates of customer usage based on initial usage information provided by the independent system operators and the distribution companies we revise these estimates and record any changes in the period as additional settlement information becomes available collectively referred to as “market usage adjustments”

loss contingencies 

we record loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated we consider loss contingency estimates to be critical accounting estimates because they entail significant judgment regarding probabilities and ranges of exposure and the ultimate outcome of the proceedings is unknown and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows see notes 13 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements 

deferred tax assets valuation allowances and tax liabilities 

we estimate a income taxes in the jurisdictions in which we operate b net deferred tax assets and liabilities based on expected future taxes in the jurisdictions in which we operate c federal and state valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and d contingent tax liabilities for estimated exposures related to our current tax positions these estimates are considered critical accounting estimates because they require projecting future operating results which is inherently imprecise and judgments related to the ultimate determination of tax positions by taxing authorities also these estimates depend on assumptions regarding our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we assess quarterly our future ability to use federal state and foreign net operating losses capital losses and other deferred tax assets using the morelikelythannot criteria these assessments include an evaluation of our recent history of earnings and losses future reversals of temporary differences and identification of other sources of future taxable income including the identification of tax planning strategies in certain situations as a result of our recent history of losses and the change in our net federal deferred tax assets we recorded a federal valuation allowance of 68 million during 2006 it is not expected that the net deferred tax assets will be realizable until we have experienced several years of profitable operations 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risks and risk management 

our primary market risk exposure relates to fluctuations in commodity prices we also have market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates as described in note 2d to our consolidated financial statements we have a risk control framework to manage our risk exposure however the effectiveness of this framework can never be completely estimated or fully assured for example we could experience hedge ineffectiveness from basis price differences transmission issues price correlation issues volume variation or other factors in addition a reduction in market liquidity may impair the effectiveness of our risk management practices and resulting hedge strategies these and other factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

nontrading market risks 

commodity price risk 

changes in commodity prices prior to the energy delivery period are inherent in our wholesale and retail energy businesses we use derivative instruments such as futures forwards swaps and options to execute our wholesale hedge strategy and retail supply procurement strategy 

as of december 31 2006 the fair values of the contracts related to our net nontrading derivative assets and liabilities are 

 

  

1   represents our nymex futures positions in natural gas crude oil and power which have quoted prices for the next 72 30 and 36 months respectively

2   represents our forward positions in natural gas coal and crude oil and power at points for which overthecounter market broker quotes are available which on average extend 24 or 36 months into the future positions are valued against internally developed forward market price curves that are validated and recalibrated against overthecounter broker quotes this category includes some transactions whose prices are obtained from external sources and then modeled to hourly daily or monthly prices as appropriate

3   represents the value of a our valuation adjustments for liquidity credit and administrative costs b options or structured transactions not quoted by an exchange or overthecounter broker but for which the prices of the underlying position are available and c transactions for which an internally developed price curve was constructed as a result of the longdated nature of the transaction or the illiquidity of the market point

the fair values shown in the table above are subject to significant changes due to fluctuating natural gas and power forward market prices volatility and credit risk market prices assume a functioning market with an adequate number of buyers and sellers to provide liquidity insufficient market liquidity could significantly affect the values that could be obtained for these contracts as well as the costs at which these contracts could be hedged 

a hypothetical 10 movement in the underlying energy prices would have the following potential gain loss impacts on our nontrading derivatives 

 

  

this risk analysis does not include the favorable impact that the same hypothetical price movements would have on our physical purchases and sales of fuel and power to which the hedges relate the adverse impact of changes in commodity prices on our portfolio of nontrading energy derivatives held for hedging purposes would be offset although not necessarily in the same period by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions assuming 

·   the derivatives are not closed out in advance of their expected term

·   the derivatives continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk and

·   as applicable anticipated underlying transactions settle as expected

if any of these assumptions cease to be true we may experience a benefit or loss relative to the exposure hedged nontrading energy derivatives that qualify and are effective as cash flow hedges may 

still have some percentage that is not effective see notes 2d and 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2005 all of our interest rate derivatives either expired or were terminated we remain subject to the benefits or losses associated with movements in market interest rates related to a portion 667 million as of december 31 2006 of our debt and certain margin deposits which are most vulnerable to changes in libor and the prime rate 

we assess interest rate risks using a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential change in our interest expense based on a hypothetical one percentage point movement in the underlying variable interest rate indices if interest rates increaseddecreased one percentage point from their december 31 2006 and 2005 levels our annual interest expense would have increaseddecreased by 15 million and 14 million respectively and our annual interest expense net of interest income would have increaseddecreased by 8 million 

we estimated these amounts by considering the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our variablerate debt adjusted for cash and cash equivalents and net margin deposits outstanding at the respective balance sheet dates 

if interest rates decreased by one percentage point from their december 31 2006 and 2005 levels the fair market values of our fixedrate debt would have increased by 189 million and 200 million respectively 

trading market risks 

prior to march 2003 we engaged in proprietary trading activities as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements trading positions entered into prior to our decision to exit this business are being closed on economical terms or are being retained and settled over the contract terms 

as of december 31 2006 the fair values of the contracts related to our legacy trading positions and recorded as net derivative assets and liabilities are 

 

  

the fair values in the above table are subject to significant changes based on fluctuating market prices and conditions for further discussion of items that impact our portfolio of trading contracts and an explanation of the sources of fair value see the discussion related to nontrading derivative assets and liabilities 

our consolidated realized and unrealized margins relating to these positions are income loss 

 

  

an analysis of these net derivative assets and liabilities is 

 

  

1   amount includes realized loss of 3 million offset by deferred settlements of 5 million

2   amount includes realized loss of 17 million and deferred settlements of 5 million

we primarily assess the risk of our legacy trading positions using a valueatrisk method to maintain our total exposure within limits set by the audit committee of our board of directors valueatrisk is the potential loss in value of trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time period within a specified confidence level we use the parametric variancecovariance method with deltagamma approximation to calculate valueatrisk 

our valueatrisk model utilizes four major parameters 

·   confidence level —95 for natural gas and petroleum products and 99 for power products

·   volatility —calculated daily from historical forward prices using the exponentially weighted moving average method

·   correlation —calculated daily from daily volatilities and historical forward prices using the exponentially weighted moving average method and

·   holding period —natural gas and petroleum products generally have two dayholding periods power products have holding periods of five to 20 days based on the risk profile of the portfolio and the liquidation period

while we believe that our valueatrisk assumptions and approximations are reasonable different assumptions andor approximations could produce materially different estimates an inherent limitation of valueatrisk is that past market risk may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk in addition valueatrisk calculated for a specified holding period does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within that specified period future transactions market volatility reduction of market liquidity failure of counterparties to satisfy their contractual obligations andor a failure of risk controls could result in material losses from our legacy trading positions 

the daily valueatrisk for our legacy trading positions is

• retail energy— provides electricity and energy services to approximately 19 million retail electricity customers in texas including residential and small business customers and large commercial industrial and governmentalinstitutional customers we also serve commercial industrial and governmental institutional customers in the pjm market • wholesale energy —provides electricity and energy services in the competitive wholesale energy markets in the united states in this connection we own and operate or contract for power generation capacity as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 15956 mw of owned or leased generation capacity in operation for information about our corporate history business segments and disposition activities see notes 1 17 19 and 20 to our consolidated financial statements and selected financial data in item 6 of this form 10k 

retail energy 

our retail energy segment provides electricity and energy services to customers primarily in texas we also have retail energy operations in the pjm market and we regularly evaluate entering other markets 

as a retail electricity provider we are responsible for arranging for the transmission and delivery of electricity to our customers billing customers and collecting payment for electricity sold and maintaining 24hour call centers to provide customer service we purchase the electricity we sell to customers from generation companies utilities power marketers and other retail energy companies as of december 31 2005 we had contracts to purchase generation capacity for our texas retail customers averaging 9166 mw per month in 2006 5965 mw per month in 2007 and 1395 mw per month in 2008 these amounts exclude commitments as of december 31 2005 related to a contract terminated in early january 2006 based on current market conditions existing retail sales commitments and current load forecasts we estimate that these contracts will supply approximately 97 of our retail energy segments current capacity requirements for 2006 for our texas retail customers 

residential and small business customers 

our retail business for residential and small business customers is primarily concentrated in texas based on metered locations as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 17 million residential and 203000 small business customers making us the second largest residential electricity provider in texas approximately 75 of our customers are in the houston area we also have customers in other texas cities including dallas ft worth and corpus christi 

commercial industrial and governmentalinstitutional customers 

in texas and the pjm market we market electricity and energy services to large commercial industrial and governmentalinstitutional customers these customers include refineries chemical plants manufacturing facilities hospitals universities governmental agencies restaurants and other facilities based on metered locations as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 36000 commercial industrial and governmentalinstitutional customers 

operations data 

the following tables present information about our retail electricity sales and customers in various markets 

 1 small business customers are our retail commercial customers that have a peak demand of less than one mw 2 large commercial industrial and governmentalinstitutional customers are our retail commercial customers that have a peak demand of more than one mw 3 these volumes include customers of the general land office for whom we provide services  1 these volumes include customers of the general land office for whom we provide services 2 

 1 these amounts include volumes of customers of the general land office for whom we provide services 2 for 2003 our weighted average retail customer count was 165 wholesale energy 

as of december 31 2005 we owned had an interest in or leased 36 operating electric power generation facilities with an aggregate net generating capacity of 15956 mw in five regions of the united states the net generating capacity of these facilities consists of approximately 38 baseload 35 intermediate and 27 peaking capacity 

we sell electricity and energy services from our generation portfolio to investorowned utilities municipalities cooperatives and other companies that serve end users or purchase power at wholesale for resale we also sell these products in hourahead dayahead forward bilateral and iso markets because our facilities are not subject to traditional costbased regulation we can generally sell electricity at marketdetermined prices the following table identifies the principal markets where we own lease and have under contract wholesale generation assets 

 we also lease transportation and storage capacity in the eastern and western united states to provide natural gas to our generation assets 

in the fourth quarter of 2005 we commenced an evaluation of our wholesale energy segments hedging strategy and use of capital in february 2006 we decided to substantially reduce new hedges of our generation for additional information see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—business overview in item 7 of this form 10k 

operations data

the following table provides information regarding generation output 

 1 excludes operations classified as discontinued operations see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements regulation 

texas 

we are certified by the puct to provide retail electric service in texas outside houston we sell electricity at unregulated prices in houston we can also sell electricity without pricing restrictions however until january 1 2007 we must continue to make electricity available to residential and small business customers at the puctapproved pricetobeat as of december 31 2005 the average pricetobeat was 163 cents per kwh for residential customers using 1000 kwh per month and 136 cents per kwh for small business customers using 15000 kwh per month 

from november 3 through december 31 2005 we did not charge the full amount of the approved pricetobeat rate to our pricetobeat customers instead we charged a price based on an imputed natural gas price of 974mmbtu in addition from january 1 through march 15 2006 we committed to the puct to charge existing residential pricetobeat customers a price based on an imputed natural gas price of 1078mmbtu rather than the current pricetobeat rate which is based on a gas price of 11387mmbtu from march 16 through june 30 2006 we committed to the puct to not charge these residential customers a price higher than the pricetobeat rate based on an imputed gas price of 11387mmbtu 

under current puct rules we can request an adjustment to the fuel factor component of the pricetobeat twice a year based on significant changes in natural gas prices and purchased energy the following table shows historical adjustments to our pricetobeat fuel factor 

 1 see discussion above regarding discounts in addition to the puct our activities in texas are subject to standards and regulations adopted by ercot see risk factors in item 1a of this form 10k 

other states 

we operate electric generation facilities in regions administered by the following isosrtos pjm cal iso and miso which operate under fercestablished tariffs and regulations in each of these regions the market rules include price limits or caps applicable to all generators in addition at the request of the local system operator we may be required to operate our plants at fixed prices or subject to temporary price caps to maintain the reliability of the local grid system the isos also impose numerous other requirements relative to the manner in which we must operate our plants 

federal energy regulatory commission 

a number of our subsidiaries are public utilities under the federal power act as public utilities these entities must sell power at either costbased rates or marketbased rates if marketbased rates authority has been granted by ferc each of our fercjurisdictional subsidiaries has been granted marketbased rate authority although some services sold by some of these entities are sold at costbased rates these subsidiaries are subject to ferc rules and oversight regulations 

seasonality and competition 

the retail and wholesale energy industries are intensely competitive our competitors include merchant energy companies utilities retail electric service providers and other companies including in recent years companies owned by investment banking firms hedge funds and private equity funds our principal competitors in the retail electricity markets outside of houston are typically incumbent utility companies or their affiliates which have the advantage of longstanding relationships with customers in general competition in the retail and wholesale energy markets is on the basis of price service and product offerings as well as market perceptions of creditworthiness for a discussion of how seasonality impacts our business and for additional information on the effect of competition see risk factors in item 1a of this form 10k and note 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local requirements relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of personnel and the public these requirements relate to a broad range of our activities including the discharge of compounds into the air water and soil the proper handling of solid hazardous and toxic materials and waste noise and safety and health standards applicable to the workplace 

for the continued economic operation of our plants we will construct modify and retrofit equipment and clean up or decommission our disposal or fuel storage areas and other locations based on existing regulations we estimate that we will spend approximately 50 million to 70 million in 2006 85 million to 120 million in 2007 and 270 million to 515 million in 2008 through 2011 the above amounts include 8 million for environmental capitalized maintenance projects in 2006 and 20 million for future ash landfill expansions from 2007 through 2011 in addition 7 million will be spent for remediation of four new jersey plants through 2011 

our estimates for compliance with new and emerging environmental regulations are based on our current assessment of items such as the cost of labor and materials and the current state of evolving technologies changes to the preceding factors revisions of regulations litigation and legislation as well as other factors could cause the actual costs to vary outside the range of these estimates 

air quality matters 

the clean air act requires the epa to define standards for air quality that are protective of public health and welfare the 1990 amendments to the clean air act directed the epa to implement programs to control ambient ozone acidic deposition acid rain and ozone depleting chemicals improve visibility in the united states pristine areas and national parks regional haze and reduce emissions of hazardous air pollutants as a result of these mandates the epa implemented a number of emission control programs that affect industrial sources including power plants by limiting emissions of no x and so 2  both of which are compounds that result from the combustion of fossil fuels no x and so 2 are precursors to the formation of acid rain fine particulate matter and regional haze no x is also a precursor to the formation of ozone 

to comply with these regulations we must purchase emission allowances andor upgrade the emissions controls at some of our facilities as part of our effort to operate our business efficiently we concluded that since our generating assets dispatch based on market prices we should maintain an emission allowances inventory that corresponds with forward power sales we plan to sell some excess emission allowances inventory if the price is equal to or above our fundamental view see risk factors in item 1a and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources in item 7 of this form 10k and notes 4 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements 

regulation of no x and so 2 emissions 

in march 2005 the epa finalized a regulation referred to as the clean air interstate rule to further reduce emissions of no x and so 2 in the eastern united states in two phases the first phase which takes effect in 2009 for no x and 2010 for so 2  requires approximately a 50 reduction in no x and so 2 emissions on an annual basis the second phase which takes effect in 2015 requires additional reductions of approximately 10 for a 60 total reduction in no x and 15 for a 65 reduction in so 2  the epa regulations include the use of capandtrade programs to achieve these reductions 

we have undertaken studies to evaluate possible impacts of the clean air interstate rule and similar legislative and regulatory proposals which will primarily affect our coalfired facilities in the eastern united states our preliminary estimates of the required capital expenditures based on an economic analysis that includes plant operability changes in the emission allowances market and potential impact of stateimposed regulations range from approximately 295 million to 545 million through 2011 for so 2 and no x  we anticipate that these expenditures would be made over time with the majority of the expenditures being incurred in 2008 and 2009 

regulation of emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants 

in march 2005 the epa adopted a national capandtrade rule that requires mercury emission reductions in two phases in 2010 and 2018 with reduction levels set at approximately 30 and 70 respectively despite the finalization of these mercury control regulations several issues remain that affect the ultimate requirement to control mercury first litigation has commenced over the final form of the rule the outcome of this litigation is uncertain and could result in a requirement to control mercury on a facilitybyfacility basis instead of under a capandtrade program second states are free to adopt their own mercury regulations that are stricter than those finalized by epa several states including pennsylvania are considering adopting stricter regulations for mercury 

given the uncertainty around the final outcome of state efforts to regulate mercury and litigation surrounding the federal mercury regulations preliminary estimates indicate that our emission control expenditures for mercury compliance could range between 35 million and 80 million through 2009 we anticipate that these expenditures would be made over time with the majority of the expenditures being incurred in 2008 and 2009 these estimates are incremental to the overall capital expenditures range for so 2 and no x  

greenhouse gas emissions 

the kyoto protocol which became effective in february 2005 requires ratifying countries to achieve substantial reductions of co 2 and other greenhouse gases between 2008 and 2012 in december 2005 the united nations climate change conference in montreal canada adopted over 40 provisions to implement this treaty although the united states congress indicated that it does not intend to ratify the treaty at this time any future limitations on power plant co 2 emissions could have a material impact on all fossil fuelfired facilities including those belonging to us 

there continues to be a debate within the united states over the direction of domestic climate change policy the united states congress is currently considering several bills that would impose mandatory limitation of co 2 emissions for the domestic power generation sector and several states primarily in the northeastern and coastal western united states are actively developing or considering statespecific or regional regulatory initiatives to stimulate co 2 emission reductions in the electric utility industry the specific impact on our business will depend upon the form of emissionsrelated legislation or regulations ultimately adopted by the federal government or states in which our facilities are located 

water quality matters 

in july 2004 the epa promulgated final regulations relating to the design and operation of cooling water intake structures at existing power plants the regulations establish best technology available standards to protect aquatic organisms in the vicinity of our plant intakes in 2004 we initiated sitespecific evaluations to determine our practicable compliance options and the associated costs the epa developed facilityspecific cost assumptions that provide an interim means to benchmark our future compliance expenditures using these assumptions we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately 50 million between 2008 and 2010 several environmental organizations and attorneys general of six northeastern states have filed lawsuits against the epa alleging the regulations are insufficient for protection of the state waters and fisheries the outcome of this litigation on the regulations cannot be determined at this time but it could significantly affect the final costs of our compliance 

other 

as a result of their age many of our facilities contain significant amounts of asbestos insulation other asbestos containing materials as well as leadbased paint existing state and federal rules require 

the proper management and disposal of these potentially toxic materials we have developed a management plan that includes proper maintenance of existing nonfriable asbestos installations and removal and abatement of asbestos containing materials where necessary we have accounted for the proper management abatement and disposal of asbestos and leadbased paint at our facilities in our financial planning see note 2q to our consolidated financial statements 

under the comprehensive environmental response corporation and liability act of 1980 and similar state laws owners and operators of facilities from or at which there has been a release or threatened release of hazardous substances together with those who have transported or arranged for the disposal of those substances are liable for the costs of responding to that release or threatened release and the restoration of natural resources damaged by any such release we are not aware of any liabilities under the act that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors  

risks related to the retail and wholesale energy industries 

the financial results of our wholesale and retail energy segments are subject to market risks beyond our control 

our results of operations financial condition and cash flows are significantly impacted by the prevailing demand and market prices for electricity purchased power fuel and emission allowances over which we have no control market prices can fluctuate dramatically in response to many factors including weather conditions changes in the prices of related commodities changes in law and regulation regulatory intervention including the imposition of price limitations bidding rules or similar mechanisms market illiquidity transmission constraints environmental limitations generation unit outages fuel supply issues and other events 

the wholesale and retail electricity markets in which we operate are relatively immature markets that are characterized by elements of both deregulated and regulated markets 

the introduction of competition into the united states electricity market is a relatively recent development as a result the market is characterized by elements of both a regulated electricity market and a deregulated electricity market consequently our ability to set rates at market prices may be constrained by regulatory restrictions or possible regulatory or political intervention in many instances the regulatory structures governing these markets are still evolving creating gaps in the regulatory framework and associated uncertainty the new competitive market has attracted a number of new participants many of these companies are larger than us and possess stronger balance sheets the emergence of aggressive competitors may put downward pressure on our retail margins and sales volumes over time other competitors are smaller less wellcapitalized entities that may default on their obligations to the market these defaults may impose costs and burdens on the remaining market participants such as us as an emerging market a significant potential for industry consolidation exists as companies seek to expand and grow their operations which may lead to stronger more wellcapitalized competitors in the industry 

our operations are subject to extensive regulations changes in these regulations could adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of conducting our business 

we operate in a regulatory environment that is undergoing significant changes as a result of varying restructuring initiatives at both state and federal levels we cannot predict the future direction of these initiatives or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on our business moreover existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to our facilities or our commercial activities such future changes in laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on business see business—regulation in item 1 of this form 10k 

we depend on facilities and systems that we do not own or control for our fuel and fuel supply and to deliver electricity to and bill our customers any disruption in these facilities or systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

we depend on a fuel sources and fuel supply facilities owned and operated by third parties to supply our generation plants and b power transmission distribution facilities and metering systems owned and operated by third parties to deliver electricity to our customers and provide energy usage data if these facilities or systems over which we have no control fail we may be unable to generate andor deliver electricity in addition inaccurate or untimely information from third parties could hinder our ability to bill customers and collect amounts owed 

the operation of generation facilities involves significant risks that could interrupt operations and increase our costs 

ownership of generation assets exposes us to risks relating to the breakdown of equipment or processes fuel supply or transportation interruptions shortages of equipment material and labor operational restrictions resulting from environmental limitations and governmental interventions as well as other operational risks in addition many of our facilities are old and require significant maintenance expenditures we are party to collective bargaining agreements with labor unions at several of our plants if a our workers were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown b other employees were to become unionized or c the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated we could experience a significant disruption in our operations and higher ongoing labor costs similarly we have an aging workforce at a number of our plants creating potential knowledge and expertise gaps as those workers retire if we are unable to secure fuel we will not be able to run our generation units if a generation unit fails we may have to purchase replacement power from third parties at higher prices we have insurance subject to limits and deductibles covering some types of physical damage and business interruption related to our generation units however this insurance may not always be available on commercially reasonable terms in addition there is no assurance that a insurance proceeds will be sufficient to cover all losses b insurance payments will be timely made or c the policies themselves will be free of substantial deductibles 

our business operations expose us to the risk of loss if third parties fail to perform their contractual obligations 

we may incur losses if third parties default on their obligations to pay us money buy or sell electricity fuel emission allowances and other commodities or provide us with fuel transportation services power transmission or distribution services for additional information about third party default risk including our efforts to mitigate against this risk see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—credit risk in item 7 of this form 10k and note 2e to our consolidated financial statements 

we have a substantial coal and oilfired generation portfolio that poses environmental issues our costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant and can affect our future financial results 

our wholesale energy segment is subject to extensive and evolving environmental regulations particularly our coal and oilfired generation units we incur significant costs in complying with these regulations and if we fail to comply could incur significant penalties in addition failure to comply with environmental requirements could require us to shut down or reduce production on our generation units or create liability exposure new environmental laws or regulations may be adopted that would further constrain our operations or increase our environmental compliance costs we also may be responsible for the environmental liabilities associated with generation units even if a prior owner caused the liabilities we concluded that since our generating assets dispatch based on market prices we should maintain an emission allowances inventory that corresponds with forward power sales we plan to sell some excess emission allowances inventory if the price is equal to or above our fundamental view to the extent allowances are required in the future to operate our facilities such allowances may be unavailable or only available at costs exceeding our sales price see business—environmental matters in item 1 of this form 10k and note 12b to our consolidated financial statements 

failure to obtain or maintain any required permits or approvals could prevent or limit us from operating our business 

to operate our generating units and retail electric business we must obtain and maintain various permits approvals and certificates from governmental agencies in some jurisdictions we must also meet minimum requirements for customer service and comply with local consumer protection and other laws our failure to obtain or maintain any necessary governmental permits or to satisfy these legal requirements including environmental compliance provisions could limit our ability to operate our business or create liability exposure 

significant events beyond our control such as hurricanes and other weatherrelated problems or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

the uncertainty associated with events beyond our control such as significant weather events and the risk of future terrorist activity may affect our results of operations and financial condition in unpredictable ways these events could result in adverse changes in the insurance markets and disruptions of power and fuel markets in addition terrorist actions could damage or shut down our generation facilities or the fuel and fuel supply facilities or the power transmission and distribution facilities upon which our generation and retail businesses are dependent these events could also adversely affect the united states economy create instability in the financial markets and as a result have an adverse effect on our ability to access capital on terms and conditions acceptable to us 

special risks relating to our texas retail operations 

we depend on third parties to provide electricity to supply our texas retail customers 

we own a very limited amount of generation capacity in texas which is insufficient to supply the electricity requirements of our texas retail operations we purchase substantially all of our texas supply requirements from third parties as a result our financial performance depends on our ability to obtain adequate supplies of electric generation from third parties at prices below the prices we charge our customers 

initiatives undertaken by the puct may negatively impact the wholesale cost of power 

the puct is expected to propose a new rule on resource adequacy and market power in the ercot region in this rule the puct is considering an increase to the current price cap applicable 

to generation bids into the ercot energy market elimination of current market power mitigation measures and adoption of new market power guidelines it is expected that these rules will be implemented sometime after the summer of 2006 if market power abuses are not adequately monitored and mitigated these rules may have the impact of increasing the wholesale cost of power which could adversely impact our gross margins in the texas retail market 

the financial performance of our texas retail electric operations depends on the amount of gross margin or headroom available in the pricetobeat tariff 

our retail energy segment derives a significant portion of its revenue from sales to pricetobeat customers the pricetobeat includes a component fuel factor that subject to puct approval can be adjusted to reflect changes in the market price of natural gas and purchased power costs under puct rules we can request this adjustment twice a year however the puct or government officials may seek to a limit these adjustments in periods of concern over price levels or b change the existing rules for adjusting the pricetobeat rates 

the price of natural gas embedded in power supply purchases associated with our pricetobeat energy commitments can be different than that reflected in the fuel factor due to 

• varying supply procurement strategies used and the timing of entering into related contracts • subsequent changes in the overall price of natural gas • daily monthly or seasonal fluctuations in the price of natural gas relative to the 12month forward prices • changes in market heat rate ie the relationship between power and natural gas prices • timing of prospective fuel factor adjustments and • other factors our earnings could be adversely affected in any period in which our power supply costs rise at a greater rate than our pricetobeat fuel factor 

the declines we have experienced in our houston retail gross margins may continue or accelerate 

in recent years we have experienced significant declines in our gross margins in the houston retail market this trend could continue and be exacerbated by regulatory intervention see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—business overview—factors affecting future performance 

we may lose further market share in the houston retail electricity market which is a significant contributor of income to our consolidated results 

in recent years we have experienced declines in our share of the houston retail electricity market which represents approximately 75 of our customer base this trend could continue if competition increases see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—business overview—factors affecting future performance 

our ability to set rates at market prices in texas may be constrained by new legislative or regulatory restrictions 

the puct is evaluating the retail electric service provided after january 2007 by incumbent providers such as us to customers who have not selected a non pricetobeat product since the texas retail electricity market opened to competition in addition the texas legislature is studying the effects of competition in the texas retail electricity market new legislation or rules governing the retail 

electric prices we are allowed to charge after january 2007 could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we depend on the ercot iso to communicate operating and system information in a timely and accurate manner corrections to prior estimated billing and other information can have an impact on our future reported financial results 

the ercot iso communicates information relating to a customers choice of retail electric provider and other data needed for servicing of customer accounts to utilities and retail electric providers any failure to perform these tasks will result in delays and other problems in enrolling switching and billing customers the ercot iso is also responsible for settling all electricity supply volumes in the ercot region information that is not accurate or timely may result in incorrect estimates of our settled volumes and supply costs that would need to be corrected when such information is received see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—new accounting pronouncements significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates—critical accounting estimates in item 7 of this form 10k 

we could be liable for a share of the payment defaults of other retail electric providers within the ercot market 

if a retail electric provider defaults on its payment obligations to ercot we together with other ercot market participants are liable for a portion of the defaulted amount based on our respective share of the total load as of december 31 2005 we accounted for approximately 20 of the total ercot load 

risks related to our company 

our borrowing levels and debt service obligations may adversely affect our business 

as of december 31 2005 we had total debt from continuing operations of 51 billion 

• we must dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to pay debt service requirements which reduces the amount of cash available for other business purposes • the covenants in our debt agreements restrict our ability to among other things a obtain additional financing b make investments or acquisitions c create additional liens on our assets and d take other actions to react to changes in our business • if we do not comply with the payment and other material covenants including the financial ratios under our debt agreements our debt holders could require us to repay our debt immediately and in the case of our revolving credit facilities and receivables facility terminate their commitment to lend us money • so long as our debt remains at current levels and substantially all our assets are pledged to secure repayment of our debt we are unlikely to obtain an investment grade credit rating • our debt levels and credit ratings may affect the evaluation of our creditworthiness by customers which could put us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors with less debt • we have to post collateral with substantially all of our commercial counterparties and levels of our collateral postings are impacted by changes in commodity prices a significant change in commodity prices could significantly increase our collateral posting obligations and require us to seek additional sources of liquidity including additional debt and • we may be more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions including changes in shortterm interest rates 16 

although we have taken steps to achieve greater financial flexibility there is no assurance that we will be successful in achieving this goal 

in february 2004 we announced a goal of achieving by the end of 2006 an adjusted net debttoadjusted ebitda ratio of 30 although we have taken steps to repay debt and implement other measures intended to improve our financial flexibility we do not believe that we will achieve this goal in 2006 even if we achieve our goal or otherwise obtain credit metrics similar to those held by entities traditionally assigned investment grade credit ratings there is no assurance credit rating agencies will improve our credit ratings 

because of our debt levels and the capitalintensive nature of our business we are vulnerable to reductions in our cash flows or liquidity 

if we were unable to generate sufficient cash flows access funds from operations or raise cash from other sources we would not be able to meet our debt service collateral postings and other obligations this situation could result from adverse developments in the energy fuel or capital markets a disruption in our operations or those of third parties or other events adversely affecting our cash flows and financial performance we could experience reductions in liquidity if changes in commodity prices trigger our contractual obligations to pledge additional collateral under commodity contracts see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources in item 7 of this form 10k 

our hedging and other risk management activities may not work as planned 

our hedges may not be effective as a result of basis price differences transmission issues price correlation volume variations or other factors see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about nontrading and trading activities and related market risks in item 7a of this form 10k 

changes in the wholesale energy market or sales of generation assets could result in impairments 

if our outlook for the wholesale energy market changes negatively or if our ongoing evaluation of our wholesale energy segment results in decisions to mothball retire or dispose of generation assets we could have impairment charges related to goodwill or our fixed assets see notes 2h and 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

lawsuits and regulatory proceedings could adversely affect our business 

from time to time we are named as a party to lawsuits and regulatory proceedings litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain any claim that is successfully asserted against us could result in significant damage claims and other losses even if we were to prevail any litigation could be costly and timeconsuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows see notes 12 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements 

we have entered into outsourcing arrangements with third party service providers in addition our retail and other commercial operations are highly dependent on computer and other operating systems including telecommunications systems any interruptions in these arrangements or systems could significantly disrupt our business operations 

in recent years we have entered into outsourcing arrangements such as information technology production software infrastructure and development and certain functions within customer operations with third party service providers if these service providers do not perform their obligations we may incur significant costs and experience interruptions in our business operations in connection with 

switching to other service providers or assuming these obligations ourselves we are also highly dependent on our specialized computer and communications systems the operation of which could be interrupted by fire flood power loss computer viruses and similar disruptions although we have some backup systems and disaster recovery plans there is no guarantee that these systems and plans will be effective 

if we acquire or develop additional generation assets or dispose of existing generation assets we may incur additional costs and risks 

subject to restrictions in our debt agreements and available capital resources we may seek to purchase or develop additional generation units or dispose of existing generation units there is no assurance that our efforts to identify and acquire additional generation units or to dispose of existing generation assets will be successful in the sale of generation units we may be required to indemnify a purchaser against certain liabilities to finance future acquisitions we may be required to issue additional equity securities or incur additional debt

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

business overview 

strategies and objectives 

our objective is to be a leader in restructuring and consolidating the competitive electricity industry as part of this objective we focus on the competitive segments of the retail and wholesale electricity markets 

retail energy our retail energy segment is a low capital investment electricity resale business with relatively stable earnings the keys to success in the retail energy segment are the volume of megawatt hours we sell to customers and the unit margins received from the customers we earn a margin by selling electricity to enduse customers and securing a margin by simultaneously acquiring supply shortterm earnings in this business are impacted by local weather patterns and the competitive tactics of other retailers in the market the longerterm earnings drivers of the business are the level of competitive intensity and our ability to retain and grow market share by having a strong brand and excellent customer service 

during 2006 we expect to complete the successful transition to a fully competitive retail market in texas which we expect will result in higher margin levels in 2007 during 2006 we will strive to switch a significant portion of our pricetobeat customers to longerterm and innovative new products to maintain our market share in houston 

wholesale energy our wholesale energy segment is a capitalintensive cyclical business whose earnings are significantly impacted by the level of natural gas prices and spark spreads among other factors the key earnings drivers are the amount of electricity we generate and the margin we earn for each unit of electricity sold we cannot control those factors that have the most significant impact on our earnings levels the factor that we have the most control over is the percentage of time that our generating plants are available to run when it is economic for them to do so shortterm earnings in our wholesale business are impacted by weather and commodity price levels longerterm earnings are driven by the level of commodity prices and regional supply and demand fundamentals 

in february 2006 we completed an evaluation of our wholesale energy segments hedging strategy and use of capital we concluded that the benefits we received from hedging were not sufficient to justify our hedging program as a result we decided to substantially reduce new hedges of our generation on a prospective basis 

corporate a key priority for 2006 is to substantially reduce the amount of capital committed to collateral requirements we will achieve this primarily through transitioning to an open wholesale model in addition we will strive to enter a creditenhanced structure for the procurement of retail supply the open model provides a meaningful representation of the earnings power of the company as it excludes the impact of historical wholesale hedging activity gains on the sales of emission allowances and gains or losses on the sales of assets and equity method investments 

we have made significant progress in restructuring our business processes to be efficient costsensitive and scalable in order to position ourselves to take advantage of future growth opportunities as of december 31 2005 we realized 315 million of our previously announced 340 million in cost reductions while the initial program is substantially complete we will continue to focus on increasing our operating efficiencies 

in 2005 we completed our planned asset divestiture program to reduce our debt levels total proceeds from the sales from 2003 through 2005 were 37 billion including the 979 million received in february 2006 for the new york plants we will continue to focus on improving our financial flexibility through enhancing our earnings 

we have made a commitment to provide greater insight into the key earnings drivers of our business in early 2006 we introduced enhanced financial disclosures that allow for a robust analysis of the impacts various factors have on our earnings 

we believe that stockholder value is enhanced through the development of a highly motivated and customerfocused work force we have focused on a series of actions designed to build a great company to work for including a communicating openly with our employees b fostering company pride among our employees c providing a satisfying and safe work environment d recognizing and rewarding employee contributions and capabilities and e enrolling our employees to be collaborative leaders committed to our future 

our ability to achieve these strategic objectives and executing these actions are subject to a number of factors some of which we may not be able to control see cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information and risk factors in item 1a of this form 10k 

factors affecting future performance 

our retail energy segment has been the largest contributor of income to our consolidated results for the last several years beginning in 2006 we expect that our wholesale energy segment will contribute more to our consolidated results for the reasons outlined below 

retail energy key earnings drivers for our retail energy segment include the margins received from sales to our retail customers and the volume of megawatt hours sold to our customers 

during 2005 in response to significant increases in natural gas prices public policy concerns and to help mitigate the impact of higher natural gas prices on our customers we agreed to phasein our pricetobeat rate increase by offering discounts to existing residential pricetobeat customers we also entered into hedges equal to the expected load for those customers we anticipate that our retail energy segments gross margin will be negatively impacted by approximately 90 million during the first quarter of 2006 based on estimated supply costs and revenue rates in addition we have estimated that gross margin will be negatively impacted by up to 70 million during 2006 because the revenue increase from our pricetobeat rate will be less than our expected increase in supply costs however each of these factors will ultimately depend on our actual revenue rates from our customers and our total supply costs 

during 2006 we expect that our retail energy segment will continue to experience a loss of pricetobeat customers due to these customers switching to other suppliers and moving to non pricetobeat products however we intend to offset this impact by adding new customers further the potential for increased energy conservation as monthly rates will be higher than in the summer of 2005 could reduce the average usage per customer also with higher bills switching rates could increase if competitive activity increases 

we do not believe that the current retail margins in the ercot region are indicative of retail margins longer term in 2007 and 2008 we believe that retail margins will return to more compensatory levels that would be associated with the transition to a fully competitive retail market in the ercot region 

for our retail energy segment we will continue to focus our supply procurement strategy on a matching our supply costs with our fixed price sales commitments and b procuring physical supply to manage operational issues and within market liquidity constraints 

wholesale energy key earnings drivers for the wholesale energy segment include a the number of hours our generation is potentially economic to operate b the commercial capacity factor of our power plants c unit margins received from our power plants d other margins received from among other things capacity payments and ancillary services and e the settlement of our historical hedges which is expected to be negative 

in 2006 we expect that the results of operations for our wholesale energy segment will improve based on increased demand in key wholesale markets including california and the pjm market increased availability of coalfueled generation plants and improved margins to achieve this we intend to perform additional maintenance on our coalfueled generation plants and improve the operating efficiency of this business segment 

as stated above in february 2006 we concluded that the benefits we received from hedging were not sufficient to justify our historical hedging program as a result we decided to substantially reduce new hedges of our generation we intend to continue entering into selective hedges including originated transactions based on a our assessment of market fundamentals to increase the return from our generation assets and b operational and market limitations requiring us to enter into fuel capacity and emissions transactions to manage our generation assets we believe that this new strategy will significantly reduce our wholesale energy segments use of capital however our earnings will be subject to volatility based on market price changes existing positions will be closed as economically feasible or in accordance with their terms 

liquidity net cash flow provided by operations for 2005 was negatively impacted by increases in margin posting requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices we anticipate reducing collateral postings including cash and letters of credit by approximately 1 billion in 2006 which will result in higher operating cash flow 

consolidated results of operations 

summary by segment 

retail energy segment our retail energy segments contribution margin was 342 million during 2005 compared to 377 million during 2004 the 35 million decrease in contribution margin was primarily due to the decrease in gross margin excluding unrealized gainslosses the gross margin decrease of 249 million was primarily due to lower hedge benefit related to pricetobeat customers lower volumes and reduced margins related to pricetobeat customers and higher other supply costs also contributed to lower retail gross margin this decrease in gross margin was partially offset by a net change in unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives of 203 million selling and marketing expense increased 13 million however operation and maintenance expense decreased 32 million primarily due to decreased salaries benefits and severance expense 

our retail energy segments contribution margin was 377 million during 2004 compared to 839 million during 2003 the 462 million decrease in contribution margin was primarily due to the net change in unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives of 265 million in addition gross margin excluding unrealized gainslosses decreased 259 million due primarily to lower hedge benefit related to pricetobeat customers lower volumes and reduced margins related to pricetobeat customers and higher other supply costs also contributed to lower retail gross margin operation and maintenance expense decreased 29 million primarily due to decreased salaries and benefits expense 

wholesale energy segment our wholesale energy segments contribution margin was 110 million during 2005 compared to 247 million during 2004 the 137 million decrease in contribution margin was primarily due to 171 million change in unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives this decrease was partially offset by a 22 million increase in gross margin excluding unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives 

our wholesale energy segments contribution margin was 247 million during 2004 compared to 381 million during 2003 the 134 million decrease in contribution margin was primarily due to a 215 million decrease in gross margin excluding unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives primarily due to a 118 million decrease in the pjm region and b 106 million change in our accounts receivable refund obligation and credit reserves for energy sales in california this decrease was partially offset by an 89 million change in unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives 

unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives we use derivative instruments to manage operational or market constraints to increase the return on our generation assets and to execute our retail energy segments supply procurement strategy some derivative instruments receive marktomarket accounting treatment which requires us to record gainslosses related to future periods based on current changes in forward commodity prices we refer to these gains and losses prior to settlement as well as ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements as unrealized gainslosses on energy derivatives in some cases the related underlying transactions being hedged receive accrual accounting treatment resulting in a mismatch of accounting treatments

liquidity and capital resources 

sources of liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations borrowings net proceeds from asset sales sales of emission allowances and securities offerings for a description of factors that could affect our liquidity and capital resources see risk factors in item 1a of this form 10k and note 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

during 2005 excluding the changes in margin deposits of 1214 million we generated 104 million in operating cash flow from continuing operations in addition we received a 237 million of net proceeds from sales of assets and net sales of emission allowances and b 52 million in contingent purchase price payments from the sale of our former european energy operations 

in june 2005 we entered into a collateral arrangement with an energy supplier as a beneficiary in which we granted a security interest in notes receivable related to our receivables facility and related assets of some of our subsidiaries as a result of this arrangement the counterparty released approximately 76 million in pledged cash collateral and letters of credit to us as of december 31 2005 the collateral arrangement provided 250 million of security the maximum permitted in 

september 2005 we amended our retail receivables facility to reduce fees improve terms extend its maturity until september 2006 and increase the maximum amount that may be borrowed from 350 million to 450 million in october 2005 we issued 299 million of additional senior secured term loans due 2010 

as of february 13 2006 we had total available liquidity of 512 million comprised of 454 million in unused borrowing capacity under our senior secured revolver and 58 million of cash and cash equivalents 

liquidity and capital requirements 

our liquidity and capital requirements primarily reflect our working capital needs capital expenditures debt service and collateral requirements examples of working capital needs include purchases of fuel and electricity purchases of emission allowances plant maintenance costs including required environmental expenditures and corporate costs such as payroll settlement costs associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings can also have a significant impact on our liquidity and cash requirements for recent settlements see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements 

most counterparties require us to post collateral the collateral amounts fluctuate depending on commodity prices price volatility levels of hedging activity seasonality and other factors including changes in our perceived credit standing as of february 13 2006 we had posted 26 billion in collateral additional postings of 94 million could have been required by counterparties collateral postings increased by 15 billion from december 31 2004 to december 31 2005 due primarily to natural gas prices which increased by 68 based on the 24month forward nymex price of natural gas for that same period 

historically increases in prices of natural gas have caused our collateral postings to increase however in october 2005 we agreed to cap prices charged to our pricetobeat customers through june 2006 see business—regulation—texas in item 1 of this form 10k for a discussion of these discounts to manage the supply risks associated with this commitment we entered into a series of natural gas futures and options through december 2006 as a result of these futures and our remaining wholesale hedges the impact of natural gas price movements on our level of collateral postings is significantly less than it has been historically although we retain exposure to changes in the shape of the natural gas forward curve and our collateral postings may increase if near term prices fall relative to longerdated prices our collateral postings are not expected to fluctuate significantly in response to upward or downward shifts across the natural gas forward curve 

we have taken steps to maintain liquidity reserves that we believe prudent in the face of volatile natural gas prices over time we expect our collateral requirements to decline because of our strategy of entering into fewer longterm hedges for our wholesale energy segment 

capital requirements the following table provides information about our actual and estimated future capital requirements 



1 excludes 7 million for 2006 through 2011 for preexisting environmental conditions and remediation which have been accrued for in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2005 see business—environmental matters in item 1 of this form 10k 2 we have estimated environmental capital expenditures of 50 million to 70 million for 2006 and have included the low end of the range in the table 3 we have estimated environmental capital expenditures of 85 million to 120 million for 2007 and have included the low end of the range in the table 4 we have estimated environmental capital expenditures of 150 million to 220 million for 2008 and have included the low end of the range in the table contractual obligations and contractual commitments the following table includes our obligations and commitments from continuing operations to make future payments under contracts as of december 31 2005 

 1 includes interest payments floating rate debt interest was estimated using projected forward libor rates as of december 31 2005 2 includes 450 million retail receivables facility and 300 million of term loans to be paid with proceeds from the sale of our new york plants see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements 3 paid approximately 150 million in january 2006 4 includes stadium naming rights estimated pension and post retirement benefit payments and other contractual obligations 37 

as of december 31 2005 we have estimated minimum sales commitments which are not classified as derivative assets and liabilities of in millions 



contingencies and guarantees we are involved in a number of legal environmental and other proceedings before courts and are subject to ongoing investigations by certain governmental agencies that could negatively impact our liquidity see notes 10 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements and risk factors in item 1a of this form 10k 

we also enter into guarantee and indemnification arrangements in the normal course of business see note 11b to our consolidated financial statements 

credit risk 

by extending credit to our counterparties we are exposed to credit risk for a discussion of our credit risk and policy see note 2e to our consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2005 our derivative assets and accounts receivable from our wholesale energy and ercot power supply counterparties after taking into consideration netting within each contract and any master netting contracts with counterparties are 

 1 the table excludes amounts related to contracts classified as normal purchases and sales and nonderivative contractual commitments that are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheets except for any related accounts receivable such contractual commitments contain credit and economic risk if a counterparty does not perform nonperformance could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows 2 collateral consists of cash standby letters of credit and other forms approved by management 3 see note 2e to our consolidated financial statements 4 for unrated counterparties we perform credit analyses including review of financial statements contractual rights and restrictions and credit support such as parent company guarantees to create an internal credit rating offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2005 we have no offbalance sheet arrangements for information regarding our principles of consolidation see note 2b to our consolidated financial statements 

historical cash flows 

cash flows—operating activities 

2005 compared to 2004 and 2004 compared to 2003 

 1 change primarily due to both a decrease in net unrealized value of our broker accounts and increased counterparty obligations 2 change primarily due to the conversion of collateral posted to letters of credit from cash 3 change primarily due to increased accounts payable as a result of increased power purchases in our wholesale energy segment partially offset by increased accounts receivable due to increases in sales prices to our retail customers 4 change primarily due to decreased accounts payable as a result of decreased purchased power and fuel purchases in our wholesale energy segment partially offset by decreased accounts receivable related to decrease in power sales volumes 39 

cash flows—investing activities 

2005 compared to 2004 and 2004 compared to 2003 

 1 decrease due to completion of our power generation development projects hunterstown and choctaw were completed in july 2003 bighorn was completed in february 2004 and new seward was completed in october 2004 2 includes 76 million 42 million and 28 million related to sales of el dorado rema hydropower plants and landfillgas fueled power plants respectively 3 change primarily due to the refinancing in december 2004 4 includes 100 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of ceredo 5 includes 804 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of hydropower plants 6 includes 14 billion of net cash proceeds from the sale of european energy operations and 285 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of desert basin 40

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

significant accounting policies 

see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates 

we make a number of estimates and judgments in preparing our consolidated financial statements these estimates can differ from actual results and have a significant impact on our recorded assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we consider an estimate to be a critical accounting estimate if it requires a high level of subjectivity or judgment and a significant change in the estimate would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations each critical accounting estimate affects both our retail energy and wholesale energy segments unless indicated otherwise the audit committee of our board of directors reviews 

each critical accounting estimate with our senior management further discussion of these accounting policies and estimates is in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

goodwill 

we consider the estimate of fair value to be a critical accounting estimate for our wholesale energy segment because a a goodwill impairment could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and b the estimate is based on a number of highly subjective judgments and assumptions see notes 2i and 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

property plant and equipment 

we consider the fair value estimate used to calculate impairment of property plant and equipment a critical accounting estimate this estimate primarily affects our wholesale energy segment which holds approximately 97 of our total net property plant and equipment see note 2h to our consolidated financial statements in determining the existence of an impairment in carrying value we make a number of subjective assumptions as to 

• whether there is an indication of impairment • the grouping of assets • the intention of holding versus selling an asset • the forecast of undiscounted expected future cash flow over the assets estimated useful life and • if an impairment exists the fair value of the asset or asset group derivative assets and liabilities 

we report our derivative assets and liabilities for which the normal purchases and sales exception has not been made at fair value and consider it to be a critical accounting estimate because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period and are dependent on many subjective factors including 

• estimated forward market price curves • valuation adjustments relating to time value • liquidity valuation adjustments • costs of administering future obligations under existing contracts and • credit adjustments based on estimated defaults by counterparties to determine the fair value for energy derivatives where there are no market quotes or external valuation services we rely on various modeling techniques there is inherent risk in valuation modeling given the complexity and volatility of energy markets therefore it is possible that results in future periods may be materially different as contracts are ultimately settled 

for additional information regarding our derivative assets and liabilities see notes 2d and 5 to our consolidated financial statements and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about nontrading and trading activities and related market risks in item 7a of this form 10k 

retail energy segment estimated revenues and energy supply costs 

accrued unbilled revenues accrued unbilled revenues of 400 million as of december 31 2005 represented 4 of our consolidated revenues and 6 of our retail energy segments revenues for 2005 

accrued unbilled revenues of 328 million as of december 31 2004 represented 4 of our consolidated revenues and 5 of our retail energy segments revenues for 2004 

accrued unbilled revenues are critical accounting estimates as volumes and rates are not precisely known at the end of each reporting period and the revenue amounts are material if our estimate of either electricity usage volumes or estimated rates were to increase or decrease by 3 our accrued unbilled revenues as of december 31 2005 would have increased or decreased by approximately 12 million a 3 increase or decrease in both our estimated electricity usage and estimated rates would have increased or decreased our accrued unbilled revenues as of december 31 2005 by approximately 24 million 

estimated energy supply costs we record energy supply costs for electricity sales and services to retail customers based on estimated supply volumes and an estimated rate per mwh for the applicable reporting period this is a critical accounting estimate as volumes and rates are not known at the end of each reporting period and the purchased power amounts are material 

a portion of our energy supply costs 53 million and 57 million as of december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively consisted of estimated transmission and distribution charges not yet billed by the transmission and distribution utilities 

in estimating supply volumes we consider the effects of historical customer volumes weather factors and usage by customer class we estimate our transmission and distribution delivery fees using the same method that we use for electricity sales and services to retail customers in addition we estimate ercot iso fees based on historical trends estimated supply volumes and initial ercot iso settlements volume estimates are then multiplied by the estimated rate and recorded as purchased power in the applicable reporting period if our estimate of electricity usage volumes increased or decreased by 3 our energy supply costs would have increased or decreased by approximately 14 million as of december 31 2005 changes in our volume usage would have resulted in a similar offsetting change in billed volumes thus partially mitigating our energy supply costs 

dependence on ercot iso settlement procedures preliminary settlement information is due from the ercot iso within two months after electricity is delivered final settlement information is due from the ercot iso within six months after electricity is delivered the six month settlement received from ercot is considered final as ercot will only resettle if there are data errors greater than 2 of that days transaction dollars or if alternate dispute resolutions are granted we record our estimated supply costs and related fees using estimated supply volumes as discussed above and adjust those costs upon receipt of the ercot iso information delays in settlements could materially affect the accuracy of our recorded energy supply costs and related fees 

change in estimates see note 2c to our consolidated financial statements 

loss contingencies 

we record loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated we consider loss contingency estimates to be critical accounting estimates because they entail significant judgment regarding probabilities and ranges of exposure and the ultimate outcome of the proceedings is unknown and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows see notes 12 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements 

deferred tax assets valuation allowances and tax liabilities 

we estimate a income taxes in the jurisdictions in which we operate b net deferred tax assets and liabilities based on expected future taxes in the jurisdictions in which we operate c valuation 

allowances for deferred tax assets and d contingent tax liabilities for estimated exposures related to our current tax positions these estimates are considered a critical accounting estimate because they require projecting future operating results which is inherently imprecise also these estimates depend on assumptions regarding our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information during 2005 and 2004 we revised our estimates of certain state tax effective rates and reflected these changes in our state deferred tax assets and liabilities 

as of december 31 2005 we have not recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets for federal net operating loss carryforwards management believes that it is more likely than not that we will realize the federal net operating loss deferred tax assets key factors in this assessment include an evaluation of our recent history of earnings and losses as adjusted future reversals of temporary differences and identification of other sources of future taxable income including the identification of tax planning strategies however we have recorded valuation allowances against some deferred tax assets for state operating loss carryforwards the difference in estimates for federal and state operating loss carryforwards is primarily due to our inability to offset state taxable income in one jurisdiction against state taxable losses in another jurisdiction during 2005 we released valuation allowances against our capital loss carryforwards as the result of net capital gains recorded during the year and the identification of various tax planning strategies that would make the realization of the remaining capital loss carryforwards more likely than not 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about nontrading and trading activities and related market risks 

market risks and risk management 

our primary market risk exposure relates to fluctuations in commodity prices we also have market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates as described in note 2d to our consolidated financial statements we have a risk control framework to manage our risk exposure however the effectiveness of this framework can never be completely estimated or fully assured for example we could experience hedge ineffectiveness from basis price differences transmission issues price correlation issues volume variation or other factors in addition a reduction in market liquidity may impair the effectiveness of our risk management practices and resulting hedge strategies these and other factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

nontrading market risks 

commodity price risk 

changes in commodity prices prior to the energy delivery period are inherent in our wholesale and retail energy businesses we use derivative instruments such as futures forwards swaps and options to execute our wholesale hedge strategy and retail supply procurement strategy as discussed in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—business overview in item 7 of this form 10k 

as of december 31 2005 the fair values of the contracts related to our net nontrading derivative assets and liabilities are 

 1 represents our nymex futures positions in natural gas crude oil and power which have quoted prices for the next 72 30 and 36 months respectively 2 represents our forward positions in natural gas coal and crude oil and power at points for which overthecounter market broker quotes are available which on average extend 24 or 36 months into the future positions are valued against internally developed forward market price curves that are validated and recalibrated against overthecounter broker quotes this category includes some transactions whose prices are obtained from external sources and then modeled to hourly daily or monthly prices as appropriate 3 represents the value of a our valuation adjustments for liquidity credit and administrative costs b options or structured transactions not quoted by an exchange or overthecounter broker but for which the prices of the underlying position are available and c transactions for which an internally developed price curve was constructed as a result of the longdated nature of the transaction or the illiquidity of the market point the fair values shown in the table above are subject to significant changes due to fluctuating natural gas and power forward market prices volatility and credit risk market prices assume a functioning market with an adequate number of buyers and sellers to provide liquidity insufficient market liquidity could significantly affect the values that could be obtained for these contracts as well as the costs at which these contracts could be hedged 

we assess the risk of our nontrading derivatives using a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential loss in fair value based on a hypothetical 10 movement in the underlying energy prices the gain loss impacts from our sensitivity analysis are 

 this risk analysis does not include the favorable impact that the same hypothetical price movements would have on our physical purchases and sales of fuel and power to which the hedges relate the adverse impact of changes in commodity prices on our portfolio of nontrading energy derivatives held for hedging purposes would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions assuming 

• the derivatives are not closed out in advance of their expected term • the derivatives continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk and • as applicable anticipated underlying transactions settle as expected if any of these assumptions cease to be true we may experience a benefit or loss relative to the exposure hedged nontrading energy derivatives that qualify and are effective as cash flow hedges may still have some percentage that is not effective see notes 2d and 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2005 all of our interest rate derivatives either expired or were terminated we remain subject to the benefits or losses associated with movements in market interest rates related to our longterm debt and bank facility obligations as well as our floating rate debt and certain margin deposits which are most vulnerable to changes in libor 

we assess interest rate risk using a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential change in our interest expense based on a hypothetical one percentage point movement in the underlying variable interest rate indices 

if interest rates increased decreased one percentage point from their december 31 2005 and 2004 levels our annual interest expense would have increased decreased by 18 million and 12 million respectively and our annual interest expense net of interest income would have increased decreased by 0 and 6 million respectively 

the above analysis does not include the mitigating effect of our interest rate hedges if threemonth libor had exceeded 44 an additional increase of one percentage point in interest rates would have increased our annual interest expense as of december 31 2005 and 2004 by 3 million and 0 respectively and our annual interest expense net of interest income would have decreased by 15 million and 6 million respectively 

we estimated these amounts by considering the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our variablerate debt adjusted for cash and cash equivalents and net margin deposits on energy trading and hedging activities outstanding at the respective balance sheet dates 

if interest rates decreased by one percentage point from their december 31 2005 and 2004 levels the fair market values of our fixedrate debt would have increased by 200 million and 233 million respectively 

trading market risks 

prior to march 2003 we engaged in proprietary trading activities as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements trading positions entered into prior to our decision to exit this business are being closed on economical terms or are being retained and settled over the contract terms 

as of december 31 2005 the fair values of the contracts related to our legacy trading positions and recorded as net derivative assets and liabilities are 

 the fair values in the above table are subject to significant changes based on fluctuating market prices and conditions for further discussion of items that impact our portfolio of trading contracts and an explanation of the sources of fair value see the discussion related to nontrading derivative assets and liabilities 

our consolidated realized and unrealized margins relating to these positions are income loss 

 an analysis of these net derivative assets and liabilities is 

 1 amount includes realized loss of 17 million and deferred settlements of 5 million we primarily assess the risk of our legacy trading positions using a valueatrisk method to maintain our total exposure within limits set by the audit committee of our board of directors valueatrisk is the potential loss in value of trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time period within a specified confidence level we use the parametric variancecovariance method with deltagamma approximation to calculate valueatrisk 

our valueatrisk model utilizes four major parameters 

• confidence level —95 for natural gas and petroleum products and 99 for power products • volatility —calculated daily from historical forward prices using the exponentially weighted moving average method • correlation —calculated daily from daily volatilities and historical forward prices using the exponentially weighted moving average method and • holding period —natural gas and petroleum products generally have two dayholding periods power products have holding periods of five to 20 days based on the risk profile of the portfolio and the liquidation period while we believe that our valueatrisk assumptions and approximations are reasonable different assumptions andor approximations could produce materially different estimates an inherent limitation of valueatrisk is that past market risk may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk in addition valueatrisk calculated for a specified holding period does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within that specified period future transactions market volatility reduction of market liquidity failure of counterparties to satisfy their contractual obligations andor a failure of risk controls could result in material losses from our legacy trading positions

regulation 

  

public utility commission of texas 

  

we are certified to provide retail electric service to residential small business and large commercial industrial and governmentalinstitutional customers in texas 

  

outside the houston area we are permitted to sell electricity at unregulated prices to our texas customers in the houston area we may sell electricity without pricing restrictions however we must continue to make available to residential and small business customers electricity at a specified price or the “pricetobeat” approved by the 

  

puct these restrictions are scheduled to expire on january 1 2007 prior to march 2004 we could only sell electricity to small business customers at the “pricetobeat” and prior to january 2005 we could only sell electricity to residential customers at the “pricetobeat” as of december 31 2004 the average “pricetobeat” was 1219 cents per kwh for residential customers using 1000 kwh per month and 965 cents per kwh for small business customers using 15000 kwh per month 

  

the “pricetobeat” includes a a baserate component established under the texas electric restructuring law and b a component commonly referred to as the fuel factor that can be adjusted to reflect changes in the market price of fuel and purchased power costs under current puct rules we can apply for an adjustment to the fuel factor component not more than twice a year if we can demonstrate there have been significant changes in the market price of natural gas or purchased energy to serve retail customers 

  

the following table sets forth adjustments approved by the puct to our “pricetobeat” fuel factor during 2002 2003 and 2004 

  

   

in february 2005 we reached an agreement with certain consumer groups and the staff of the puct to address future adjustments to our “pricetobeat” in connection with centerpoint’s resolution of its strandedcost recovery issues as described below the agreement which is subject to the approval of the puct provides for two downward adjustments to our fuel factor in 2005 if during specified periods in that year natural gas prices decrease from the gas price in the current or specified future fuel factors pending the puct’s review and approval of the agreement the current “pricetobeat” will remain in effect we expect that the puct will issue a decision approving the agreement in march or april of 2005 

  

if the agreement is approved we would expect that the first fuel factor adjustment would occur on april 29 2005 if at that time the average of 12month forward natural gas prices between march 1 and march 29 is lower than the average upon which our current fuel factor was calculated the puct will adjust our fuel factor downward the adjusted fuel factor would then remain in effect until august 11 2005 on which date we have committed to file a request to reduce our fuel factor if the average of 12month forward natural gas prices as of august 9 2005 has decreased by five percent or more from the average used in calculating the most recently established fuel factor between august 11 and october 31 2005 we have agreed not to request an increase in our fuel factor unless the 12month average of forward natural gas prices increases by 10 percent or more from the price used in establishing the prior fuel factor in the absence of the agreement we would have been entitled to request a fuelfactor increase if the 12month average had increased by five percent or more 

  

the agreement also provides for the termination of certain credits provided to centerpoint’s transmission and distribution charges excess mitigation credits and concurrent dollar for dollar adjustments in our “pricetobeat” to reflect these and other stranded costrelated charges in the price we pay to centerpoint if the agreement were not approved we would be entitled to request an adjustment to our “pricetobeat” to take into account these extra costs as they occur subject to puct approval however pending the puct’s approval of our request we would not be permitted to pass on to customers any additional centerpoint charges in addition any adjustment approved by the puct would not have retroactive effect if the agreement were not approved we would no longer be subject to the commitment to make two potential downward adjustments in our fuel factor however we would anticipate that the puct would make a downward adjustment to our fuel factor if at the time it adjusts the “pricetobeat” to reflect changes in the charges we pay to centerpoint the average of the 12month forward natural gas prices is lower than the average upon which our current fuel factor was calculated 

  

ercot iso 

  

we are a member of ercot members of ercot include retail customers both investor and municipal owned electric utilities rural electric cooperatives river authorities independent generators power marketers and retail electric providers the ercot iso is responsible for maintaining reliable operations of the bulk electric power supply system and operating and settling the ancillary service and energy imbalance market in the ercot region for additional information regarding ercot including information regarding problems experienced in ercot information systems see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk factors” in item 7 of this form 10k 

  

regulations in other states 

  

certain of our principal markets most notably california new york city and the pjm market have rules that in certain instances may impose limits or caps on the price at which we can sell electricity in addition the market authorities in certain regions have the authority to compel us to operate our generation facilities in order to maintain the reliability of the local grid system under these circumstances we are entitled to receive a “mitigated price” for electricity dispatched into the system that is intended to enable us to recoup our incremental operating costs plus a designated margin 

  

two of our generating units in california are subject to a reliability mustrun agreement with the cal iso which expires in december 2005 unless extended by the terms of the agreement this agreement requires the units under certain conditions and at the cal iso’s request to operate at specified levels in order to support grid reliability under the agreement we recover an annual revenue requirement for the generation assets at issue as approved by the ferc however we recently entered into a multiyear bilateral contract with southern california edison company to supply capacity from these units therefore cost recovery will not be provided under the reliability mustrun agreement but instead through the agreement with southern california edison company 

  

federal energy regulatory commission 

  

the ferc has exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale power sales in interstate commerce our affiliates that own power generation facilities sell their output primarily under marketbased rate authority granted by the ferc transfers of ownership of these affiliates’ fercjurisdictional assets are subject to ferc approval our affiliates with marketbased authority are also subject to certain ferc accounting and reporting requirements as well as ferc oversight of issuance of securities and the appointment of directors who hold directorships in companies in other industries under certain circumstances the ferc can revoke or limit our marketbased rate authority if the ferc revokes or limits our marketbased rate authority we would be required to obtain approval from the ferc of costbased rates in order to make wholesale sales in addition the loss of our marketbased rate authority would subject us to certain accounting record keeping and reporting requirements that the ferc imposes on public utilities with costbased rates some of our affiliates provide ancillary services and reliability services at costbased rates on file with the ferc 

  

in certain markets where we own power generation facilities specifically california and new york the ferc has from time to time approved temporary price caps on our wholesale power sales or other market mitigation measures in addition our affiliates with marketbased rate authority are subject to the ferc market behavior rules as to all of their sales at marketbased rates if we violate these rules we could be subject to disgorgement of profits suspension or revocation of our authority to sell at marketbased rates and other penalties since the rules are relatively new it is not clear to what extent the new rules will affect the costs or other aspects of our operations however we do not anticipate that our entities with marketbased rates for wholesale power sales will be affected materially by the new rules 

  

we operate electric generation facilities in regions administered by the following fercapproved isosrtos pjm nyiso cal iso and miso with certain exceptions the isosrtos in these regions have established markets for the purchase and sale of transmission and wholesale capacity energy and ancillary services the ferc establishes tariffs and regulates these markets in the case of the miso while its transmission market is operational its wholesale energy market is not expected to be operational until april 2005 

  

the ferc has issued a blanket certificate permitting us to sell natural gas in interstate commerce in connection with the management of our natural gas positions 

  

securities and exchange commission 

  

our electric generation subsidiaries either have received determinations of exempt wholesale generator status from the ferc or are companies that own or operate qualifying facilities that are exempt from the public utility holding company act 

  

seasonality 

  

our revenues and operating income are subject to fluctuations during the year due to the impact seasonal factors have on demand for electric energy and energy services for information regarding the impact of seasonality on our business see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk factors” in item 7 of this form 10k and note 17 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

competition 

  

for information regarding competitive factors affecting our business see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk factors” in item 7 of this form 10k 

  

environmental matters 

  

we are subject to numerous federal state and local requirements relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of personnel and the public these requirements relate to a broad range of our activities including the discharge of compounds into the air water and soil the proper handling of solid hazardous and toxic materials and waste noise and safety and health standards applicable to the workplace environmental regulations affecting us include but are not limited to 

  

   

   

   

   

in order to comply with these requirements we will as necessary spend substantial funds to construct modify and retrofit equipment and clean up or decommission our disposal or fuel storage areas and other locations we believe based on existing environmental and regulatory requirements that we have commitments to spend approximately 107 million from 2005 through 2009 for environmental compliance of which 10 million is for remediation in addition based on the final form of pending environmental regulations and laws we could be required to make additional capital expenditures as described below 

  

air quality matters 

  

the clean air act requires the epa to define standards for air quality that are protective of public health and welfare the 1990 amendments to the clean air act directed the epa to implement programs designed to control ambient ozone acidic deposition acid rain and ozone depleting chemicals improve visibility in the united states’ pristine areas and national parks regional haze and reduce emissions of hazardous air pollutants 

  

as a result of the mandates of the clean air act the epa has implemented a number of emission control programs that affect industrial sources including power plants by limiting emissions of no x and so 2  both of which are compounds that result from the combustion of fossil fuels no x is a precursor to the formation of ozone acid rain fine particulate matter and regional haze so 2 is a precursor to the formation of acid rain fine particulate matter and regional haze 

  

the epa has determined that additional reductions in no x and so 2 are needed to meet all of the goals of the clean air act furthermore the epa determined in 2000 that emissions of mercury from power plants must be 

  

reduced at present the epa and the united states congress are both considering programs to achieve the necessary reductions of no x  so 2 and mercury 

  

regulation of no x and so 2 emissions  to comply with epamandated reductions in no x and so 2 emissions we are required from time to time to either purchase emissions allowances from third parties for certain of our generating facilities or make capital investments in such facilities emissions allowances are created under programs whereby regulatory authorities establish industrywide “caps” for certain emissions and then give generating plants within a region a target and a deadline to reduce their emissions companies that reduce emissions further than required are then able to trade their emission allowances with companies that cannot meet their targets in 2004 our allocations and net purchases for no x emissions resulted in a surplus of approximately 8000 allowances and we acquired approximately 78000 allowances of so 2 emissions from third parties each allowance is the equivalent of one ton of emissions 

  

in january 2004 the epa proposed a new regulation referred to as cair to control emissions of no x and so 2 on a broad scale if enacted as proposed cair would require reductions in no x and so 2 in two phases the first phase which would take effect in 2010 requires approximately a 50 reduction in so 2 and no x emissions on an annual basis the second phase which would take effect in 2015 requires additional reductions of approximately 20 for a 70 total reduction in so 2 and no x on an annual basis these reductions would be achieved through aggregate reductions not on a facilitybyfacility basis the proposed regulation requires reductions in 29 states beyond levels already required in existing federal programs and would primarily affect our coalfired facilities in the eastern united states 

  

in december 2004 it was announced that the finalization of cair will be delayed in anticipation of cair possibly being replaced by emission reduction legislation as discussed under “— legislative approaches to emission reductions” below we have undertaken studies to evaluate possible impacts of this and similar legislative and regulatory proposals while the regulations have not been finalized our preliminary estimates of the capital expenditures that would be needed under the proposed programs range from approximately 260 million to 500 million through 2009 we anticipate that these expenditures would be made over time with the majority of the expenditures being incurred in 2008 and 2009 

  

regulation of emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants the epa is under a court order to enact regulations for the control of emissions of mercury from coalfired power plants in the united states by march 2005 pursuant to the order the epa proposed two alternative regulations in december 2003 the mact standard and the capandtrade rule 

  

the mact standard requires reductions to be achieved by 2008 on a facilitybyfacility basis regardless of cost if adopted as proposed the mact standard would require an approximate 30 reduction in mercury emissions from each of our coalfired facilities which would require the installation of control equipment at each facility in addition the mact standard would require the control of nickel emissions from oilfired facilities reliant owns two oilfired facilities that would be affected under this rule as proposed while the mact nickel regulation has not been finalized we have evaluated the impact which is estimated to be approximately 35 million for one of the facilities and we are currently evaluating the capital expenditures that may be required for the second facility 

  

the capandtrade rule effects emission reductions on a national scale through a trading program allowing reductions to be made at the most economical locations and not requiring reductions on a facilitybyfacility basis this alternative if adopted would require larger reductions than the mact standard and would be accomplished in two phases in 2010 and 2018 with reduction levels set at approximately 30 and 70 respectively under the capandtrade rule we would be allocated allowances based on regulatory requirements and our total annual emissions surplus allowances can be sold in an emissions market to companies that cannot meet their emission targets likewise allowances can be purchased to cover shortfalls in the same fashion if the capandtrade rule were ultimately adopted we anticipate that our approach would be to balance capital expenditures for controls and reliance on allowance markets to achieve compliance 

  

the epa may adopt either proposal a combination of the two proposals or such proposals may be included in the possible multipollutant legislation announced by the white house in december 2004 and discussed under “— legislative approaches to emissions reductions” below until the regulations are finalized we cannot predict the costs associated with compliance however based on the proposed rules as an indicator of potential impact to our business preliminary estimates indicate that our emission control expenditures for mercury compliance could range 

  

between 55 million and 185 million through 2009 we anticipate that these expenditures would be made over time with the majority of the expenditures being incurred in 2008 and 2009 

  

due to the uncertainty around the final outcome of this regulation these estimates have not been included in the overall capital expenditures range discussed above 

  

legislative approaches to emission reductions  in february 2002 the white house announced its “clear skies initiative” which is aimed at longterm reductions of multiple pollutants produced from fossil fuelfired power plants to achieve these goals the clear skies act has been introduced in the united states congress the clear skies act requires reductions averaging 70 for so 2  no x and mercury if approved by congress this program would entail a marketbased approach using emission allowances compliance with emission limits would be phased in over a period from 2008 to 2018 we do not expect the cost of implementation of requirements for so 2 and no x reductions to differ substantially from those associated with the cair proposal 

  

air quality enforcement issues  the epa and various states are conducting investigations regarding the historical compliance of coalfueled electric generating stations with the “new source review” requirements of the clean air act the epa and the united states department of justice initiated formal enforcement actions and litigation against several power generation companies other than us alleging that these companies violated new source review requirements by modifying their facilities without proper preconstruction permit authority since june 1998 eight of our coalfired facilities have received epa requests for information related to work activities conducted at those sites the epa has also agreed to provide information relating to the new source review investigations to the new york state attorney general’s office the new jersey department of environmental protection and the pennsylvania department of environmental protection in addition the pennsylvania department of environmental protection requested additional information from us in 2004 specific to one of these facilities 

  

the epa has not filed an enforcement action or initiated litigation in connection with these facilities at this time nevertheless any litigation if pursued successfully by the epa could accelerate the timing of emission reductions anticipated as a result of proposed regulations which could result in significant capital expenditures and the imposition of penalties 

  

greenhouse gas emissions  the kyoto protocol which became effective in february 2005 requires ratifying countries to achieve substantial reductions of co 2 and certain other greenhouse gases between 2008 and 2012 although the united states congress indicated that it does not intend to ratify the treaty at this time any future limitations on power plant carbon dioxide emissions could have a material impact on all fossil fuelfired facilities including those belonging to us 

  

there continues to be a debate within the united states over the direction of domestic climate change policy the united states congress is currently considering several bills that would impose mandatory limitation of co 2 emissions for the domestic power generation sector and several states primarily in the northeastern and coastal western united states are actively developing or considering statespecific or regional regulatory initiatives to stimulate co 2 emission reductions in the electric utility industry the specific impact on our business will depend upon the form of emissionsrelated legislation or regulations ultimately adopted by the federal government or states in which our facilities are located 

  

water quality matters 

  

the epa and state environmental regulators periodically review and revise water quality criteria and initiate total maximum daily load determinations under the clean water act these actions may result in more stringent wastewater discharge limitations for our power plants and the need to install additional water treatment systems or control measures 

  

in july 2004 the epa promulgated final regulations relating to the design and operation of cooling water intake structures at existing power plants the regulations establish “best technology available” standards to protect aquatic organisms in the vicinity of our plant intakes in 2004 we initiated sitespecific evaluations to determine our practicable compliance options and the associated costs the epa developed facilityspecific cost assumptions that provide an interim means to benchmark our future compliance expenditures using these assumptions we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately 50 million in 2008 through 2010 exclusive of our astoria facility in addition we expect to spend approximately 75 million for cooling water intake modifications at our astoria 

  

facility between 2005 and 2009 in compliance with a new york department of environmental conservation consent order see note 14a to our consolidated financial statements 

  

several environmental organizations and attorney generals of six northeastern states have filed lawsuits against the epa alleging the regulations are insufficient for protection of the state waters and fisheries the outcome of this litigation on the regulations cannot be determined at this time an unfavorable decision by the courts regarding the regulations including the use of restoration as a compliance option could significantly affect the final costs of compliance 

  

other 

  

as a result of their age many of our facilities contain significant amounts of asbestos insulation other asbestoscontaining materials and leadbased paint existing state and federal rules require the proper management and disposal of these potentially toxic materials in response to these regulations we developed a management plan that includes proper maintenance of existing nonfriable asbestos installations and removal and abatement of asbestos containing materials and leadbased paint 

  

under cercla and similar state laws owners and operators of facilities from or at which there was a release or threatened release of hazardous substances together with those who transported or arranged for the disposal of those substances are liable for the costs of responding to that release or threatened release and the restoration of natural resources damaged by any such release we are not aware of any liabilities under cercla that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

 risk factors 

  

the following risk factors should be considered carefully together with the risk factors and contingencies described in “business” in item 1 of this form 10k “— liquidity and capital resources” below and notes 13 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements the risks described in this section are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could also have a material impact on our business operations 

  

risks relating to selling electricity 

  

the wholesale and retail electricity markets are highly competitive 

  

the market for wholesale and retail electricity customers is very competitive in certain markets our principal competitors include the local regulated electric utility or its nonregulated affiliate in other markets we face competition from independent electric providers independent power producers and wholesale power providers in many cases our competitors have the advantage of longstanding relationships with customers longer operating histories andor more capital resources as a result it may not be profitable for us to enter into some markets and our ability to retain or increase market share may be hindered 

  

in general we compete on the basis of price service and performance levels and commercial and marketing skills other factors affecting our competitive position include our ability to obtain fuel supplies at competitive prices to operate our generation plants and the availability of electricity for resale and related transportationtransmission services since many of our energy customers suppliers and transporters require financial guarantees and other assurances regarding contract performance our access to letters of credit surety bonds and other forms of credit support is another factor affecting our ability to compete in the market 

  

for additional information relating to competitive risks affecting our retail energy segment see “— special risks relating to our retail business operations in the texas market” below and “business — regulation” in item 1 of this form 10k 

  

our business is subject to market risks the impact of which we cannot fully mitigate 

  

unlike a traditional regulated electric utility we are not guaranteed a rate of return on our capital investments our results of operations financial condition and cash flows depend in large part upon prevailing market prices for electricity and fuel in our markets market prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time potentially adversely affecting our business changes in market prices for electricity and fuel may result from the following factors among others 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we operate a significant number of power generation plants to operate these plants we must enter into commitments with various terms for fuel and transmission capacity or services although we attempt to sell forward a significant portion of our generation capacity and to procure the fuel for forward sales we do not hedge all of our generation plant output and related fuel supply and thus changes in commodity prices could positively or negatively affect our business 

  

in marketing our products we rely on power transmission and distribution facilities that we do not own or control if these facilities fail to provide us with adequate transmission capacity we may not be able to deliver power to our customers 

  

we depend on power transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and others to deliver energy products to our customers if transmission or distribution is inadequate or disrupted our ability to sell and deliver our products may be hindered any infrastructure failure that interrupts or impairs delivery of electricity could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

risks relating to ownership of generation assets 

  

operation of power generation facilities involves significant risks that could adversely affect our business 

  

our operation of generation assets exposes us to risks relating to the breakdown of equipment or processes fuel supply interruptions shortages of equipment material and labor and other operational risks in addition significant portions of our facilities were constructed many years ago older generating equipment even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices may require significant capital expenditures to maintain efficiency to comply with changing environmental requirements or to provide reliable operations such expenditures increase our operating costs further our ability to successfully and timely complete capital improvements to existing facilities 

  

or other capital projects is contingent upon many variables and subject to many risks any unexpected failure to produce power including failure caused by breakdown or forced outage could cause a shortfall in power generation output and require us to purchase power from third parties to meet customer demands the cost of purchased power under these circumstances could be substantially higher than the cost of generating the power at our plants 

  

future changes in the wholesale energy market or sales of generation assets could result in our recognition of additional impairments of goodwill related to our wholesale energy segment 

  

during 2003 we recognized an impairment of goodwill of 985 million pretax and aftertax reflecting a decrease in the estimated fair value of our wholesale energy segment in the future we could have additional impairments of goodwill that would need to be recognized if our wholesale energy market outlook changes negatively in addition our ongoing evaluation of our wholesale energy business could result in decisions to mothball retire or dispose of additional generation assets any of which could result in additional impairment charges related to goodwill impact our fixed assets’ depreciable lives or result in fixed asset impairment charges 

  

certain of our coal contract suppliers have defaulted or may default under their delivery obligations which could adversely affect our business 

  

our coalfueled units represent approximately 25 of our capacity as of december 31 2004 we committed to purchase approximately 89 of our expected coalfuel requirements for 2005 pursuant to coal supply contracts no individual coal supplier represents more than 23 of our estimated annual coal supply requirements during 2004 the average price of spot eastern coal increased from 30 per ton to 65 per ton which represents market prices higher than those for which we contracted to purchase coal during 2004 two of our coal suppliers representing 12 of our 2004 contracted coal supplies and 6 of our 2005 expected needs defaulted under their supply contracts when our coal or other fuel suppliers fail to perform their obligations we could be forced to replace the underlying commitment at thencurrent market prices which could result in reduced operating results or losses or expose us to the risk of shortfalls in supplies 

  

uninsured judgments or a rise in insurance premiums could adversely affect our business 

  

we have insurance coverage subject to various limits and deductibles covering our generation facilities including property damage insurance and general liability insurance in amounts that we consider appropriate however we cannot assure you that insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms or that the insurance proceeds received for any loss of or any damage to any of our generation facilities will be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition the costs of our insurance coverage have increased significantly during recent years and may continue to increase in the future which could adversely affect our business 

  

regulatory risks 

  

our operations are subject to extensive regulations changes in these regulations could adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of conducting our business 

  

we operate in a regulatory environment that is undergoing significant changes as a result of varying restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels we cannot predict the future direction of these initiatives or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on our business moreover existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to our facilities or our commercial activities such future changes in laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on our business for additional information see “business — regulation” in item 1 of this form 10k and note 14 to our consolidated financial statements actions by groups such as isos andor market monitors can also adversely affect our business 

  

if we fail to obtain or maintain any necessary governmental permits or approvals we may not be able to operate our plants 

  

to own and operate our generation facilities we must obtain and maintain permits approvals and certificates from federal state and local governmental agencies in addition we must also comply with a variety of complex environmental and other regulations most of our generation facilities are exempt wholesale generators that sell electricity exclusively into the wholesale market these facilities are subject to regulation by the ferc regarding rate matters although the ferc has authorized us to sell electricity produced from these facilities at market prices the ferc retains the authority to modify or withdraw our marketbased rate authority and to impose “cost of 

  

service” rates any reduction by the ferc of the rates we may receive for our generation activities could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

our retail electric operations also require us to obtain and maintain various permits approvals and certificates from governmental agencies in addition in certain jurisdictions we must meet minimum requirements to maintain adequate levels of customer service and otherwise comply with local consumer protection and other laws 

  

our costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant the cost of compliance with environmental laws could adversely affect our business 

  

we are required to comply with numerous environmental laws and regulations including those related to air emissions wastewater discharge and the handling transportation storage disposal release and cleanup of or exposure to hazardous substances and wastes we also must obtain numerous federal state and local governmental permits in operating our power generation facilities such laws and regulations can be revised reinterpreted or become applicable to our facilities or new laws and regulations could be adopted we may incur significant costs to comply with these requirements including the potential need to install expensive plant upgrades and we may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals if there is a delay in obtaining any required approval or if we fail to obtain maintain or comply with the terms of any such approvals or to comply with any such laws or regulations we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties including fines and the operation of our facilities could be stopped or become subject to additional costs further it may be uneconomical for us to install the necessary equipment at some of our older power generation facilities which may cause us to shut down those facilities and suffer a loss in generating capacity the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

in addition we may be responsible for any onsite liabilities associated with the environmental condition of facilities that we have acquired or developed regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown and at times regardless of who caused such condition in connection with certain acquisitions and sales of assets we may obtain or be required to provide indemnification against certain environmental liabilities if we are subject to such liabilities another party fails to meet its indemnification obligations to us or if we are required to make an indemnification payment to a third party it could have an adverse effect on our business for additional information regarding compliance with environmental laws see “business — environmental matters” in item 1 of this form 10k and note 14a to our consolidated financial statements 

  

we are parties to numerous legal proceedings relating to the “energy crisis” in california and other western states during 2000 and 2001 these proceedings could subject us to potentially significant damage claims refund obligations andor could adversely affect our ability to collect certain receivables that we have recorded for certain counterparties in the california market 

  

we are defendants in a number of lawsuits filed against us that challenge the prices of wholesale electricity and natural gas that we charged in california and other western states the claims relate primarily to the period between october 2000 and july 2001 however it is possible that claims may be asserted with respect to other periods 

  

we are also defendants in a number of cases filed against us alleging that our actions in reporting gas prices and in purchasing gas during 2000 and 2001 caused an increase in gas prices additional lawsuits making similar allegations may be filed 

  

in addition we are a party to a refund proceeding initiated by the ferc in 2001 regarding wholesale electricity prices that we charged in california from october 2 2000 through june 20 2001 which we refer to as the 20002001 refund proceeding as of december 31 2004 our consolidated balance sheet included a 200 million net receivable which has been adjusted for our estimated refund obligation discussed below from the cal iso and the cal px relating to power sales into the markets run by the cal iso and the cal px subject to the 20002001 refund proceeding although this proceeding has not yet concluded we currently estimate our refund obligation to be 89 million based on the most recent refund methodology adopted by the ferc with respect to these receivables 

  

in september 2004 the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit overturned a determination by the ferc that the failure of our subsidiaries to file certain transactionspecific information with the ferc in periods prior to october 2000 did not result in a refund obligation to the extent that the subsidiaries sold energy at prices above “just and reasonable” rates the court has ordered the ferc to reconsider its remedial options which the court noted could include possible refunds we are not in a position to predict the ultimate impact of the court’s decision or the ferc’s reconsideration of its remedial options upon remand as a result our estimate of potential 

  

refund obligations in the 20002001 refund proceeding does not include the impact of additional refunds being ordered by the ferc for periods prior to october 2000 

  

the issues relating to the foregoing legal and regulatory proceedings are complex and involve a number of pending court and regulatory proceedings the resolution of these matters is uncertain and could range from litigating certain of these matters to conclusion to resolving certain of these matters through settlement or some combination of both litigation and settlement a number of energy companies have entered into settlement agreements with the state of california certain california utilities and various other parties to resolve certain litigation and receivable refund issues related to the california energy crisis the terms and the scope of these settlements vary however many of the settlements required the participating energy companies to make substantial cash payments and waive their rights to collect receivables related to certain sales in the california market we have also from time to time pursued and are continuing to pursue the possible settlement of a number of the litigation and regulatory issues relating to the disputes arising out of the western states energy crisis there can be no assurance that any settlements relating to these matters will be reached in the event that settlements did result from these discussions they would likely include provisions similar to the prior settlements discussed above that have been entered into by other energy suppliers in the california market we are unable to predict at this time the outcome of the litigation proceedings and related settlement discussions for additional information see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

we are parties to numerous other legal and regulatory proceedings that could subject us to potentially significant damage claims 

  

we are defendants in a number of legal and regulatory proceedings in addition to proceedings relating to the western states energy matters including shareholder class action lawsuits filed against us and centerpoint and lawsuits alleging breaches of fiduciary duties in violation of the employee retirement income security act these and other lawsuits are described in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

risks relating to our retail business operations including special risks related to our texas retail operations 

  

our results of operations could be materially affected by decisions of the puct regarding the “pricetobeat” and related regulatory matters 

  

the puctapproved price or “pricetobeat” that we are currently required to make available to residential and small commercial customers in the houston area includes a component that can be adjusted to reflect changes in the market price of fuel and purchased power costs this component commonly known as the fuel factor was originally established in 2001 and is fixed until such time as the puct grants an adjustment under current puct rules we can apply for an adjustment not more than twice a year if we can demonstrate there have been significant changes in the market price of natural gas or purchased energy to serve retail customers 

  

the price of natural gas embedded in our power supply purchases associated with our “pricetobeat” energy commitments can be different than the price of natural gas reflected in the fuel factor component of our “pricetobeat” revenue rate due to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

to the extent that our power supply costs are greater than the “pricetobeat” fuel factor in any given period our business in that period could be adversely affected 

  

for information regarding an agreement entered into with the puct staff and certain consumer groups regarding adjustments to our “pricetobeat” in 2005 including certain risks associated with a failure of the puct to approve such agreement see “business — regulation — public utility commission of texas” 

  

we may experience a nearterm reduction in our retail energy segments gross margin when the “pricetobeat” rates are adjusted for stranded costs 

  

in december 2004 the puct determined the “stranded costs” of centerpoint following this determination the puct will revise the “nonbypassable charges” to compensate centerpoint for its stranded costs nonbypassable costs are charges for the delivery of power by centerpoint and other regulated transmission and distribution companies we requested the puct to set a schedule to adjust the “pricetobeat” concurrently with the revision to centerpoint’s nonbypassable charges to reflect all changes in these charges since january 1 2002 as part of this request the puct has the ability to review the fuel factor in our “pricetobeat” rates which could trigger a nearterm reduction in our retail energy segment’s gross margins when the “pricetobeat” rates are adjusted for stranded costs until the “pricetobeat” is adjusted any approved increase in centerpoint’s nonbypassable charges will be borne by us we cannot predict at this time the change in the level of nonbypassable charges that centerpoint will be granted nor can we predict the timing or size of any adjustment to the “pricetobeat” 

  

we have experienced declines in our retail gross margins in the texas market and such declines may continue into the foreseeable future or possibly accelerate  

  

our retail gross margins may be affected by a number of factors including increased competition energy supply and hedging costs and the “pricetobeat” rates in addition although we have benefited from our ability to enter into favorable hedging arrangements with respect to our energy supply costs our retail margins may be negatively affected if the hedging arrangements that we enter into in future periods are less favorable than historical hedging arrangements 

  

we may lose a significant number of customers and a significant portion of our market share in texas 

  

we provide electricity and energy efficiency services to residential small commercial and large commercial industrial and governmentalinstitutional customers in the houston area as well as in other parts of the ercot region we or any other electric provider can provide services to these customers at any negotiated price the market for these customers is competitive and any of these customers that select us to be their provider may subsequently decide to switch to another provider at the conclusion of their contract with us consequently we may lose a significant portion of our market share in texas 

  

we are dependent upon third party providers of capacity and energy to supply our retail customer obligations in texas 

  

we do not own sufficient generating resources in texas to supply all of the electricity requirements of our retail business in this market as a result we must purchase substantially all of the generation capacity necessary to supply our retail energy business in texas from third parties as of december 31 2004 we had entered into contracts to purchase generation capacity averaging 8759 mw per month in 2005 3409 mw per month in 2006 and 957 mw per month in 2007 based on current market conditions existing retail sales commitments and current load forecasts we estimate that these contracts will supply approximately 91 55 and 15 of the current estimated capacity requirements of our retail energy business for 2005 2006 and 2007 respectively consequently our financial performance depends heavily on the performance by our suppliers under these longterm contracts 

  

during 2004 the largest supplier of generation capacity for our texas retail energy business was texas genco which accounted for approximately 40 of our supply requirements we expect to continue to contract with third parties including texas genco for a substantial portion of our texas retail energy business’ power requirements in addition we may seek to supplement our marketbased purchases of power over time with the purchase of individual generation assets although there can be no assurance as to the timing or success of such future acquisition efforts 

  

we are dependent on metering systems that we do not own or control failure to receive accurate and timely information could adversely affect our business 

  

we are dependent on the transmission and distribution utilities for reading our customers’ energy meters we also rely on the local transmission and distribution utility or in some cases the iso to provide us with our customers’ information regarding energy usage and we may be limited in our ability to confirm the accuracy of the information if we receive incorrect or untimely information from the transmission and distribution utilities we could have difficulty properly billing our customers and collecting amounts owed to us failure to receive correct and timely information could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

changes in estimates for retail energy sales and costs as a result of problems the ercot iso’s information and other systems could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

  

the ercot iso’s responsibilities include ensuring that information relating to a customer’s choice of retail electric provider including data needed for ongoing servicing of customer accounts is conveyed in a timely manner to the appropriate parties problems in the flow of information between the ercot iso the transmission and distribution utilities and the retail electric providers have resulted in delays and other problems in enrolling switching and billing customers when all involved parties do not successfully process customer enrollment transactions ownership records in the various systems supporting the market are not synchronized properly and subsequent transactions for billing and settlement are adversely affected the potential impacts could include us not being the electric providerofrecord for intended or agreed upon time periods delays in receiving customer consumption data that is necessary for billing the incorrect application of rates or prices and wholesale imbalances in our electricity supply and actual sales 

  

the ercot iso is also responsible for handling scheduling and settlement for all electricity supply volumes in the ercot region the ercot iso plays a vital role in the collection and dissemination of metering data from the transmission and distribution utilities to the retail electric providers we and other retail electric providers schedule volumes based on forecasts which are based in part on information supplied by the ercot iso to the extent that these amounts are not accurate or timely we could have incorrectly estimated our scheduled volumes and supply costs for additional information on the risks associated with the ercot iso see “— new accounting pronouncements significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates — critical accounting estimates” in this form 10k 

  

payment defaults by other retail electric providers to ercot could have an adverse affect on our business 

  

in the event of a default by a retail electric provider of its payment obligations to ercot the portion of the obligation that is unrecoverable by ercot is assumed by the remaining market participants in proportion to each participant’s load ratio share we would pay a portion of the amount owed to ercot should such a default occur if ercot is not successful in recovering such amounts the default of a retail electric provider in its obligations to ercot could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

general business risks 

  

our longterm strategic plans are predicated upon the continuation of a trend toward greater competitive markets in the energy industry 

  

our wholesale and retail energy businesses operate in the deregulated segments of the electric power industry the success of our longterm strategic plans is predicated upon the continuation of the trend toward greater competitive markets in this industry if the trend towards competitive restructuring of the electric power industry is reversed discontinued or delayed our business could be adversely affected 

  

our efforts to achieve investment grade status may not be successful 

  

our ability to achieve investment grade status is dependent upon among other things our success in enhancing our profitability managing and reducing our costs including achieving our adjusted net debttoebitdar objectives divesting nonstrategic assets or assets that perform marginally and resolving on commercially acceptable terms many of the pending litigation and regulatory proceedings to which we are subject although we have taken a number of steps toward achieving each of these objectives our ability to meet these objectives continues to remain subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as outlined below in addition even if we achieve credit metrics consistent with those traditionally ascribed by rating agencies to investment grade companies there is no guarantee that rating agencies will automatically assign us investment grade status 

  

our efforts at cost reduction may not be successful  

  

we have implemented programs designed to save a total target of 340 million in annual cost savings by 2006 through reductions in our overhead and operating costs and implementation of process efficiencies the first cost rationalizing program which involved “rightsizing” with no strategic or structural changes totals approximately 140 million and is largely complete a second cost reduction program that commenced in 2004 has a target of 200 million in savings by the end of 2006 to be achieved in two phases the first phase is virtually complete and involved simplifying our corporate structure the second phase which is ongoing involves implementing process 

  

improvements across our organization by the end of 2004 we realized approximately 270 million related to our cost reduction programs 

  

although we intend to continue to identify and pursue opportunities to restructure our business operations in order to reduce our costs and our liquidity and capital requirements our ability to reduce our cost structure while maintaining prudent operating standards is limited in addition as we review and make changes in our internal cost structure we likely will incur increased shortterm costs due to severance payments and restructuring processes it is also possible that in restructuring and simplifying our operations we may increase the risk of an impairment of certain assets such as information technology systems to the extent that changes in our business eliminate the need for such assets 

  

as part of our costreduction efforts we have consolidated a number of our internal risk controls and other support functions and made significant reductions in our corporate overhead although we believe that our internal controls will continue to be effective and adequate for our restructured operations there could be increased risks as a result of reduced personnel and changing processes including information technology systems 

  

we may not be successful in achieving our objective to reduce our adjusted net debttoebitdar by 2006 

  

we intend to reduce our adjusted net debttoebitdar ratio by the end of 2006 to meet this objective we have sold certain business operations and assets curtailed plans to construct new electric generation and retired or mothballed generation units that are currently not economic to operate although the implementation of these strategies has enabled us to make progress in achieving our debt reduction targets our ability to achieve these targets remains subject to a number of assumptions including assumptions regarding our future performance including achieving cost savings and the performance of the markets in which we operate 

  

in addition our ability to achieve our objective to reduce our adjusted debttoebitdar targets by 2006 is dependent in part on our ability to divest nonstrategic assets andor raise money to pay down debt by issuing securities in the capital market our ability to divest assets is dependent on numerous factors over which we may not have control including market conditions timing factors and unanticipated changes in regulations and laws in addition the terms of our credit agreements impose certain restrictions on our ability to sell assets including a requirement that we receive consideration for assets sold equal to their fair market value as defined in the credit agreement and that at least 90 of the consideration we receive be in the form of cash or cash equivalents as defined under our credit agreements our ability to raise cash in the capital markets to pay down debt is subject to uncertainties and risks associated with our future performance market conditions in the retail and wholesale energy markets and other factors over which we have no control 

  

the ultimate outcome of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings to which we are a party could have an adverse affect on our business and impair our ability to achieve our objective to obtain investment grade status 

  

we are party to numerous lawsuits and regulatory proceedings relating to our historical trading and wholesale energy activities in addition various state and federal governmental agencies have conducted investigations relating to these activities including the california attorney general the ferc and criminal investigations by the united states attorneys for the northern district of california and the southern district of texas the ultimate disposition of some of these matters could have an adverse effect on our business including our objective to achieve investment grade status for additional information see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

our business and ability to access capital and insurance could be adversely affected by terrorist attacks or related acts of war 

  

the uncertainty associated with the military activity of the united states and other nations and the risk of future terrorist activity may affect our results of operations and financial condition in unpredictable ways these actions could result in adverse changes in the insurance markets and disruptions of power and fuel markets in addition our generation facilities or the power transmission and distribution facilities could be targets of terrorist activity the risk of terrorist attacks or acts of war could also adversely affect the united states economy create instability in the financial markets and as a result have an adverse effect on our ability to access capital on terms and conditions acceptable to us 

  

our business operations expose us to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties 

  

our operations are exposed to the risk that counterparties who owe us money or commodities and services such as power natural gas or coal will not perform their obligations when such parties fail to perform their obligations 

  

we might be forced to replace the underlying commitment at thencurrent market prices in this event we could incur reduced operating results or losses 

  

in our business operations we often extend credit to our counterparties many of these parties have belowinvestment grade credit ratings despite using collateral agreements to mitigate against these credit risks we are exposed to the risk that we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us to the extent a counterparty fails to perform and any collateral we have secured is insufficient we will incur additional losses see “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about nontrading and trading activities and related market risks — credit risk” in item 7a of this form 10k 

  

risks related to our corporate and financial structure 

  

our leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our business 

  

we have now and will continue to have a significant amount of debt outstanding as of december 31 2004 we had total consolidated debt of 52 billion and stockholders’ equity of 44 billion our level of indebtedness could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the incurrence of additional debt could make it more likely that we will experience some or all of the abovedescribed risks 

  

despite current indebtedness levels we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage 

  

although our credit and debt agreements contain restrictions on our incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions as of december 31 2004 our revolving credit agreements permitted us to borrow up to an additional 880 million if new debt is added to our current debt levels the risks that we now face could substantially increase see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

if we do not generate sufficient positive cash flows we may be unable to service our debt 

  

our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt depends on our future operating performance future operating performance is subject to market conditions and business factors that often are beyond our control if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to allow us to make scheduled payments on our debt we may have to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt we cannot assure you that the terms of our debt will allow these alternative measures or that such measures would satisfy our scheduled debt service obligations 

  

based on our current level of anticipated cost savings and operating improvements we believe our cash flow from operations available cash and available borrowings under our credit facilities will be adequate to meet our future needs for at least the next twelve months for further discussion of our current liquidity situation and related impacts see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” in item 7 of this form 10k 

  

we cannot assure you that our businesses will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to enable us to pay the principal and interest on our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs we may not be successful in realizing the cost savings and operating improvements that we currently anticipate if commodity prices increase substantially in the near term our liquidity could be severely strained we may need to refinance all or a portion of our 

  

indebtedness on or before maturity however we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance the indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and as a result 

  

   

   

   

we may not have adequate liquidity including to post required amounts of additional collateral or meet guarantee and indemnification obligations 

  

we have guaranteed or indemnified the performance of a portion of our subsidiary obligations including those involved in hedging activities if these guarantee and indemnity obligations were to become due and payable at one time our subsidiaries or we as the case may be may not be able to satisfy all of these obligations in addition if commodity prices change substantially in the near term our liquidity could be severely strained including by requirements under our commodity agreements to post additional collateral 

  

in certain cases our counterparties have elected not to require us to post collateral to which they are otherwise entitled under certain agreements however these counterparties retain the right to request such collateral factors that could trigger increased demands for collateral include additional adverse changes in our industry negative regulatory or litigation developments andor changes in commodity prices based on commodity prices we estimate that as of february 15 2005 we could have been contractually required to post additional collateral of up to 152 million related to our operations 

  

the terms of our debt may severely limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business and the failure to comply with such terms may adversely affect our business 

  

our credit and debt agreements restrict our ability to take specific actions in planning for and responding to changes in our business without the consent of our lenders and noteholders even if such actions may be in our best interest our credit facilities also require us to maintain specified financial ratios and meet specific financial tests our ability to comply with these covenants as they currently exist or as they may be amended may be affected by many events beyond our control and our future operating results may not allow us to comply with the covenants or in the event of a default to remedy that default our failure to comply with these financial covenants or to comply with the other restrictions in our credit and debt agreements could result in a default which could cause that indebtedness to become immediately due and payable if we are unable to repay those amounts the holders of our debt could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness if those lenders accelerate the payment of our debt we cannot assure you that we could pay that indebtedness immediately and continue to operate our business 

  

in addition our credit and debt agreements contain other covenants that restrict among other things our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

an increase in shortterm interest rates could adversely affect our cash flows 

  

as of december 31 2004 we had 20 billion of outstanding floating rate debt any increase in shortterm interest rates would result in higher interest costs and could have an adverse effect on our business while we may seek to use interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments to hedge portions of our floatingrate exposure we may not be successful in obtaining hedges on acceptable terms 

  

our noninvestment grade credit ratings and the perceived negative credit worthiness of merchant energy companies in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to access capital on acceptable terms commercialize our assets and engage in hedging activities 

  

our credit ratings are below investment grade and are likely to remain below investment grade for the foreseeable future our noninvestment grade credit ratings could limit our ability to refinance our debt obligations and access the capital markets on terms that are favorable to us in addition to the extent that our credit ratings remain below investment grade commercial counterparties may decline to conduct business with us or such parties may require us to pledge cash collateral post letters of credit or provide other similar credit support these requirements constitute a significant constraint on our liquidity and cash resources and could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

our historical financial results as a subsidiary of centerpoint may not be representative of our results as a separate company 

  

the historical financial information relating to periods prior to our separation from centerpoint does not necessarily reflect what our results of operations financial condition and cash flows would have been had we been a separate standalone entity during such periods our costs and expenses during such periods reflect charges from centerpoint for centralized corporate services and infrastructure costs these allocations have been determined based on assumptions that we and centerpoint considered to be reasonable under the circumstances this historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of what our results of operations financial condition and cash flows will be in the future we may experience significant changes in our cost structure funding and operations as a result of our separation from centerpoint including increased costs associated with reduced economies of scale and increased costs associated with being a publicly traded standalone company 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

in this section we discuss the principal sources of capital resources required for us to operate our business we also identify known trends demands commitments events or uncertainties that may affect our current and future liquidity or capital resources in the last part of this section we provide information regarding our historical cash flows 

  

sources of liquidity and capital resources 

  

our principal sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations borrowings under our revolving credit and asset securitization facilities and proceeds from certain debt and equity offerings 

  

cash flows from operations  all of our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries as a result reliant energy’s cash flow is dependent upon the receipt from its subsidiaries of cash dividends distributions payments associated with intercompany borrowings or other transfers of cash generated by their operations for a description of factors that could affect the cash flows from operations see “— risk factors” in this form 10k and notes 2m and 8 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

credit capacity cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2004 we had consolidated current and longterm debt outstanding of 52 billion and our unused borrowing capacity was 880 million from our revolving credit agreements as of december 31 2004 384 million of our committed credit facilities are to expire by december 31 2005 for a discussion of our credit facilities bonds notes and other debt see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

all of our major credit and other debt agreements contain restrictive covenants failure to comply with these covenants could have a number of effects including limitations on our ability to make additional borrowings under our credit facilities increases in borrowing costs and the acceleration of indebtedness for additional information 

  

regarding these covenants and the impact of a default under these covenants on our ability to borrow funds see “— risk factors” in this form 10k and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

shelf registration we issued 750 million of debt securities in december 2004 under our 35 billion shelf registration statement see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

factors affecting future sources of liquidity and capital resources although we are committed to identifying opportunities through restructuring our business operations and otherwise to reduce our liquidity needs it is possible that we may need to incur additional debt or to issue equity or convertible instruments subject to restrictions contained in our credit facilities and other debt agreements to meet future obligations our ability to supplement our liquidity and capital resources could be affected by a number of factors including those discussed in “— risk factors” in this form 10k 

  

although we have completed a number of financing transactions in 2004 and 2003 we anticipate that continuing depressed conditions within the wholesale electric markets our subinvestment grade credit ratings and other uncertainties will continue to have an impact on our ability to borrow funds on acceptable terms if we require but are unable to obtain additional sources of financing to meet our future capital requirements our financial condition and future results of operations could be adversely affected our current credit ratings are and are likely to remain for the next few years below investment grade see “— risk factors” in this form 10k 

  

liquidity and capital requirements 

  

our liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of our working capital needs capital expenditures debt service requirements and collateral requirements examples of working capital needs include purchases of fuel and electricity plant maintenance costs including required environmental expenditures and corporate costs such as payroll 

  

during 2003 and 2004 we set a total target of 340 million in annual cost savings by 2006 through reductions in our overhead and operating costs and implementation of process efficiencies approximately 270 million has been realized to date for additional discussion see “— risk factors” in this form 10k 

  

capital expenditures the following table sets forth the capital expenditures we incurred in 2004 and the estimates of these expenditures for 2005 through 2007 

  

    

   

major maintenance expenses the following table sets forth the major maintenance expenses we incurred in 2004 and the estimates of these expenses for 2005 through 2007 

  

   

sales commitments as of december 31 2004 we have sales commitments including electric energy and capacity sales contracts which are not classified as derivative assets and liabilities and hence are not included in our consolidated balance sheet the estimated minimum sales commitments under these contracts are as follows in millions 

  

   

contractual obligations and contractual commitments in the following table we provide disclosure concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts such as debt and lease agreements and purchase obligations as of december 31 2004 for 2005 through 2010 and thereafter 

  

    

in most cases involving our commercial contracts andor guarantees the impact of further rating downgrades is negligible the following table details our cash collateral posted and letters of credit outstanding as of february 15 2005 

  

   

for discussion about our potential collateral requirements as of february 15 2005 and other risks related to liquidity see “— risk factors” in this form 10k 

  

we are involved in a number of legal environmental and other proceedings before courts and governmental agencies we are also subject to ongoing investigations by certain governmental agencies although we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings many of these matters involve substantial claim amounts that in the event of an adverse judgment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows for additional information see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

as of december 31 2004 we have no offbalance sheet arrangements for information regarding our principles of consolidation see note 2c to our consolidated financial statements 

  

historical cash flows 

  

the following table provides an overview of cash flows relating to our operating investing and financing activities 

  

   

cash flows — operating activities 

  

2004 compared to 2003 and 2003 compared to 2002 net cash provided by operating activities decreased 580 million during 2004 compared to the same period in 2003 net cash provided by operating activities increased 353 million during 2003 compared to the same period in 2002 the changes are detailed as follows 

  

    

   

   

   

year ended december 31 2004 changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities from continuing operations for 2004 are detailed as follows in millions 

  

    

   

year ended december 31 2003 changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities from continuing operations for 2003 are detailed as follows in millions 

  

    

   

   

   

year ended december 31 2002 changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities from continuing operations for 2002 are detailed as follows in millions 

  

    

   

   

   

   

cash flows — investing activities 

  

2004 compared to 2003  net cash provided by investing activities decreased 323 million during 2004 compared to the same period in 2003 primarily due to cash inflows of 16 billion in 2003 from our discontinued operations partially offset by net proceeds of 870 million or 863 million after transaction costs of 7 million from the sale of our hydropower plants in september 2004 see notes 20 and 21 to our consolidated financial statements in addition capital expenditures have decreased related to our power generation development projects as two facilities were completed in july 2003 one facility was completed in february 2004 and one facility was completed in october 2004 see discussion below 

  

2003 compared to 2002  net cash provided byused in investing activities changed by 45 billion during 2003 compared to the same period in 2002 primarily due to the acquisition of orion power for 29 billion in 2002 in addition cash flows provided by investing activities of our discontinued operations increased 15 billion in 2003 compared to 2002 see discussion below 

  

year ended december 31 2004 net cash provided by investing activities during 2004 was 719 million primarily due to cash flows of 865 million from our discontinued operations mainly due to net proceeds from the sale of our hydropower plants this was offset by cash outflows due to capital expenditures of 173 million 97 million for growth capital expenditures and 76 million for maintenance capital expenditures primarily related to our power generation operations and development of power generation projects 

  

year ended december 31 2003 net cash provided by investing activities during 2003 was 10 billion primarily due to cash inflows of 16 billion from our discontinued operations primarily due to net proceeds from the sales of our european energy operations 14 billion and our desert basin plant operations 285 million see notes 19 and 20 to our consolidated financial statements this was offset by cash outflows due to capital expenditures of 570 million 398 million for growth capital expenditures and 172 million for maintenance capital expenditures primarily related to our power generation operations and development of power generation projects 

  

year ended december 31 2002 net cash used in investing activities during 2002 was 35 billion primarily due to the acquisition of orion power for 29 billion in february 2002 and 620 million in capital expenditures 310 million for growth capital expenditures and 310 million for maintenance capital expenditures primarily related to our power generation operations and development of power generation projects this was offset by cash inflows of 98 million from our discontinued operations primarily due to a 137 million cash dividend from our discontinued european energy operation’s equity investment in nea bv formerly the coordinating body for the dutch electric generating sector 

  

cash flows — financing activities 

  

2004 compared to 2003  net cash used in financing activities during 2004 decreased 18 billion during 2004 compared to the same period in 2003 see discussion below 

  

2003 compared to 2002  net cash used inprovided by financing activities changed by 69 billion during 2003 compared to the same period in 2002 see discussion below 

  

year ended december 31 2004 net cash used in financing activities during 2004 is detailed as follows in millions 

  

   

year ended december 31 2003 net cash used in financing activities during 2003 is detailed as follows in millions 

  

   

year ended december 31 2002 net cash provided by financing activities during 2002 of 40 billion is primarily due to an increase in shortterm borrowings used to fund the acquisition of orion power and an increase in working capital to meet future obligations and other working capital requirements in addition net cash provided by financing activities increased due to decreased investments of excess cash in an affiliate of centerpoint these cash inflows were partially offset by the purchase of 200 million in principal amount of the orion power holdings 45 convertible senior notes see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

new accounting pronouncements significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

for discussion regarding new accounting pronouncements that will impact us see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

significant accounting policies 

  

we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states for discussion regarding our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

we make a number of estimates and judgments in preparing our consolidated financial statements these estimates to the extent they differ from actual results can have a significant impact on our recorded assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in this section we discuss those estimates that we deem to be “critical accounting estimates” we consider an estimate to be a “critical accounting estimate” due to either a the level of subjectivity or judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or b the susceptibility of such matters to change and that could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations the audit committee of our board of directors reviews each critical accounting estimate with our senior management 

  

goodwill 

  

as of november 1 of each year we test goodwill for each of our reporting units in addition we test goodwill if an event occurs indicating that an asset carrying value may not be recoverable the following table shows net goodwill by reportable segment for the indicated period 

  

   

in 2003 we recognized impairment charges totaling 985 million related to our wholesale energy reporting unit in 2002 we recognized impairment charges totaling 716 million related to our european energy segment goodwill 234 million reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and 482 million reported as a component of loss from discontinued operations for information regarding impairment charges reflected in the reported periods in our consolidated financial statements see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

we estimate the fair value of our wholesale energy segment based on a number of subjective factors including a appropriate weighting of valuation approaches income approach market approach and comparable public company approach b projections about future power generation margins c estimates of our future cost structure d discount rates for our estimated cash flows e selection of peer group companies for the public company approach f required level of working capital g assumed terminal value and h time horizon of cash flow forecasts 

  

we consider the estimate of fair value to be a critical accounting estimate for our wholesale energy segment because a a potential goodwill impairment could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and b the estimate is based on a number of highly subjective judgments and assumptions we do not consider the estimate of fair value and goodwill of our retail energy segment to be a critical accounting estimate as our prior estimates of fair value for that reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value 

  

in determining the fair value of our wholesale energy segment we made the following key assumptions a the markets in which we operate will continue to be deregulated b there will be a recovery in electricity margins over time to a level sufficient such that companies building new generation facilities can earn a reasonable rate of return on their investment and c the economics of future construction of new generation facilities will likely be driven by regulated utilities in 2003 and 2004 only as part of our process we modeled all of our power generation facilities and those of others in the regions in which we operate the following table summarizes certain of these significant assumptions 

  

   

for discussion of the factors impacting changes to our assumptions in the above table see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

in the near future if our wholesale energy market outlook changes negatively we could have additional impairments of goodwill that would need to be recognized in addition our ongoing evaluation of our wholesale energy business could result in decisions to mothball retire or dispose of additional generation assets any of which 

  

could result in additional impairment charges related to goodwill impact our fixed assets’ depreciable lives or result in fixed asset impairment charges 

  

california net receivables 

  

as described in note 14b to our consolidated financial statements we have recorded a 200 million net receivable as of december 31 2004 for energy sales in california during the period from october 2 2000 through june 20 2001 the receivable is an estimate based on a number of assumptions including the outcome of a ferc refund proceeding 

  

we consider this estimate which affects only our wholesale energy segment to be a critical accounting estimate because a changes in this estimate can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and b the estimate of the net receivable is based on a number of highly subjective judgments and assumptions we have adjusted these receivables related to the period from october 2000 through june 2001 to account for a the estimated refund obligation b a credit reserve as of december 31 2003 c a discount on the receivables and d interest accrued on the receivables the adjustments are as follows 

  

   

for information regarding related changes in our estimates and assumptions see note 14b to our consolidated financial statements 

  

property plant and equipment  

  

we evaluate our property plant and equipment for impairment if events indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from an asset is less than the carrying value of the asset we recognize an impairment by subtracting the fair value of the asset from its carrying value we consider the fair value estimate to be a critical accounting estimate because a an impairment can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and b the highly subjective nature of the many judgments and assumptions used in the estimate the estimate of carrying value primarily affects our wholesale energy segment which holds approximately 97 of our total net property plant and equipment 

  

in determining the existence of an impairment in carrying value we make a number of subjective assumptions as to a whether an indicator of impairment has occurred b the grouping of assets c the intention of “holding” versus “selling” an asset d the forecast of undiscounted expected future cash flow over the asset’s estimated useful life and e if an impairment exists the fair value of the asset or asset group if our wholesale energy market outlook changes negatively we could have additional impairments of our property plant and equipment in future periods additionally future decisions to mothball retire or dispose of assets could result in impairment charges it is also possible that in restructuring and simplifying our operations in the future as discussed in “— business overview” in this form 10k we may increase the risk of an impairment of certain assets such as information technology systems to the extent that changes in our business eliminate the need for such assets 

  

during 2004 we recognized in depreciation expense a 16 million impairment of equipment related to turbines and generators and 13 million related to the writeoff of software development costs and other assets during 2003 we recognized depreciation expense of 7 million related to the writedown of an office building to its fair value less cost to sell which was determined with the assistance of an independent appraiser during 2002 we recognized a 37 million impairment recorded in depreciation expense related to steam and combustion turbines and two heat recovery steam generators see notes 2g and 13c to our consolidated financial statements 

  

depreciation expense 

  

as of december 31 2004 approximately 88 of our total gross property plant and equipment was comprised of electric generation facilities and equipment we estimate depreciation expense using the straightline method based on projected useful lives we consider these estimates which affect primarily our wholesale segment to be critical accounting estimates because a they require subjective judgments regarding the estimated useful lives of property plant and equipment and b changes in the estimates could affect future depreciation expense and hence our results of operations 

  

during 2004 we recognized 12 million in depreciation expense for the early retirement of certain power generation units during 2003 we recognized 14 million in depreciation expense for the early retirement of power generation units at two facilities during 2002 we recognized 15 million in depreciation expense for the early retirement of power generation units at the warren facility for additional information regarding depreciation expense see note 2g to our consolidated financial statements 

  

for power generation facilities purchased in acquisitions we estimate useful life based on a the condition of the acquired facilities b the fuel type of the generation facilities c future environmental requirements d projected maintenance and e projected future cash flows for power generation facilities that we construct we use the design life provided in the construction contract in the absence of a specified design life we estimate the weighted average life of the components of a power generation unit of a facility 

  

significant portions of our facilities were constructed many years ago older generating equipment may require significant upgrades which could affect judgments as to their useful life in addition alternative technologies could reduce the useful lives of portions of these facilities 

  

if we had assumed that our gross property plant and equipments’ lives had decreased by 10 from the estimated lives used in our calculation of depreciation expense for 2004 our depreciation expense would have been approximately 456 million or 11 higher 

  

derivative assets and liabilities 

  

we report our nontrading and trading derivative positions in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value 

  

we consider the fair values of our derivative assets and liabilities to be a critical accounting estimate because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period and are dependent on many subjective factors including a estimated forward market price curves b valuation adjustments relating to time value c liquidity valuation adjustments calculated by utilizing observed market price liquidity which represent the estimated impact on fair values resulting from the widening of bidask spreads for transactions occurring further in the future d costs of administering future obligations under existing contracts and e credit adjustments based on estimated defaults by counterparties that are calculated using historical default probabilities for corporate bonds for companies with similar credit ratings in addition to determine the fair value for energy derivatives where there are no market quotes or external valuation services we rely on modeling techniques in certain circumstances prices are modeled using a variety of techniques such as moving averages calibration models and other time series techniques market equilibrium analysis extrapolationinterpolation a range of contingent claims valuation methods and volumetric risk modeling there is inherent risk in valuation modeling given the complexity and volatility of energy markets therefore it is possible that results in future periods may be materially different as contracts are ultimately settled we also believe estimates regarding the probability that hedged forecasted transactions related to our nontrading derivatives will occur by the end of the time period specified in the original hedging documentation to be a critical accounting estimate these estimates affect all of our reportable operating segments 

  

for additional information regarding our derivative assets and liabilities see notes 2d 6 and 8e to our consolidated financial statements and “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about nontrading and trading activities and related market risks” in item 7a of this form 10k item 7a includes an analysis of the impact a 10 hypothetical adverse change on the fair value of our nontrading derivatives and valueatrisk information related to our legacy trading positions as of december 31 2004 and 2003 

  

retail energy segment estimated revenues and energy supply costs 

  

accrued unbilled revenues in 2004 accrued unbilled revenues of 328 million represented 4 of our consolidated revenues and 5 of our retail energy segment’s revenues in 2003 accrued unbilled revenues of 290 million represented 3 of our consolidated revenues and 5 of our retail energy segment’s revenues 

  

accrued unbilled revenues are based on our estimates of customer usage since the date of the last meter reading and initial usage information provided by the ercot iso and the electric distribution companies in the pjm market relating to customer meter reading data provided by third parties which we have limited ability to confirm in estimating electricity usage volumes we rely upon daily forecasted volumes estimated customer usage by class and applicable customer rates based on analyses reflecting significant historical trends and experience volume estimates are then multiplied by our estimated rate by customer class to calculate the unbilled revenues we record the unbilled revenues in the current reporting period and then reverse it in the subsequent reporting period when actual usage and rates are known and billed 

  

we consider our estimate of accrued unbilled revenue to be a critical accounting estimate because of a the uncertainty inherent in estimating customer volumes b the problems or delays in the flow of information between the ercot iso the transmission and distribution utilities and the retail electric providers c the potential negative impact on our business results of operation and cash flows based on the receipt of inaccurate or delayed information from the transmission and distribution utilities or the ercot iso and d the fact that as additional information becomes available the impact of recognizing revised estimates in subsequent periods relating to a previous period can be material to our retail energy segment’s and our consolidated results of operations if our estimate of either electricity usage volumes or estimated rates were to increase or decrease by 3 our accrued unbilled revenues as of december 31 2004 would have increased or decreased by approximately 10 million a 3 increase or decrease in both our estimated electricity usage and estimated rates would have increased or decreased our accrued unbilled revenues as of december 31 2004 by approximately 20 million 

  

estimated energy supply costs we record energy supply costs for electricity sales and services to retail customers based on estimated supply volumes and an estimated rate per mwh for the applicable reporting period we consider this accounting estimate to be a critical accounting estimate because of a the uncertainty inherent in estimating both the supply volumes and the rate per mwh b the uncertainty related to the ercot iso settlement process as discussed below and c the fact that as additional information becomes available the impact of recognizing revised estimates in subsequent periods relating to a previous period can be material to our retail energy segment’s and our consolidated results of operations 

  

in 2004 and 2003 a portion of our energy supply costs 57 million and 53 million respectively consisted of estimated transmission and distribution charges not billed by the transmission and distribution utilities 

  

in estimating supply volumes we consider the effects of historical customer volumes weather factors and usage by customer class we estimate our transmission and distribution delivery fees using the same method that we use for electricity sales and services to retail customers in addition we estimate ercot iso fees based on historical trends estimated supply volumes and initial ercot iso settlements volume estimates are then multiplied by the estimated rate and recorded as purchased power expense in the applicable reporting period if our estimate of electricity usage volumes increased or decreased by 3 our energy supply costs would have increased or decreased by approximately 9 million as of december 31 2004 changes in our volume usage would have resulted in a similar offsetting change in billed volumes thus partially mitigating our energy supply costs 

  

dependence on ercot iso settlement procedures in texas the ercot iso is responsible for scheduling and settling all electricity volumes and related fees in the ercot region as part of settlement the ercot iso communicates actual volumes compared to scheduled volumes the ercot iso calculates an additional charge or credit by calculating the difference between the actual and scheduled volumes multiplied by the marketclearing price for balancing energy service the ercot iso also charges customerserving market participants’ administrative fees reliability must run contract fees out of merit energy fees and out of merit capacity fees the ercot iso allocates these and other fees to market participants based on each market participant’s share of the total load we may not know about these fees which are generally outside of our control until the fees are billed if the ercot iso’s records indicate that our volumes delivered were greater than the volumes our records indicate we may be billed a larger than expected share of these total fees 

  

preliminary settlement information is due from the ercot iso within two months after electricity is delivered final settlement information is due from the ercot iso within 12 months after electricity is delivered we record our estimated supply costs and related fees using estimated supply volumes as discussed above and adjust those costs upon receipt of the ercot iso information delays in settlements could materially affect the accuracy of our recorded energy supply costs and related fees 

  

the ercot iso volume settlement process has been delayed on several occasions because of operational problems with data management among the ercot iso the transmission and distribution utilities and the retail electric providers the ercot iso continues to experience problems processing volume data during 2004 there were negative trends from ercot iso final settlement data related to “unaccounted for energy” and supply costs compared to our estimates that we have recorded as of december 31 2004 the ercot iso has issued trueup settlements through may 2004 as of december 31 2004 the ercot iso’s settlement calculations indicate that our customers utilized greater volumes of electricity by approximately 293000 mwh for 2003 and 73000 mwh for january through may 2004 as of december 31 2004 we have a net payable of approximately 1 million recorded for final settlement with ercot this consists of an 18 million receivable related to 2003 and a 19 million payable related to 2004 the ultimate resolution of these differences could result in changes in estimates of our energy supply costs for our retail operations 

  

changes in estimates see note 2d to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding changes in estimates recorded related to our retail energy revenues and energy supply costs as additional information becomes available we may recognize additional income or losses related to future changes in estimates 

  

loss contingencies 

  

we record a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly analyze current information and as necessary provide accruals for probable liabilities on the eventual disposition of those matters that can be estimated we consider these estimates to be critical accounting estimates because a they entail significant judgment by us regarding probabilities and ranges of exposure b the ultimate outcome of the proceedings relating to these contingencies is unknown and c the ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows estimates of contingent losses affect all our reportable segments for a discussion of these contingencies see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

deferred tax assets valuation allowances and tax liabilities 

  

we estimate a income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate b net deferred tax assets based on expected future taxable benefits in such jurisdictions and c valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in 2004 we revised our estimates of certain state tax effective rates and reflected these changes in our state deferred tax assets and liabilities as of december 31 2004 we have recorded no valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets for federal operating loss carryforwards and have recorded full valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets for state operating loss carryforwards management believes that it is more likely than not that we will realize the federal operating loss deferred tax assets a key factor in this assessment is our historical experience of generating taxable income after removal of infrequent or unusual taxable losses in recent years management however believes that the likelihood of realizing certain state operating loss deferred tax assets is less than 50 percent the difference in estimates for federal and state is primarily due to our inability to offset state taxable income in one jurisdiction against state taxable losses in another jurisdiction whereas we can offset our subsidiaries with federal taxable income against our subsidiaries with federal taxable losses on our consolidated federal income tax return for additional information regarding these estimates which affect all of our reportable segments see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements we consider these estimates to be a critical accounting estimate because a they require estimates of projected future operating results which are inherently imprecise and b they depend on assumptions regarding our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible 

  

in addition we recognize contingent tax liabilities for estimated exposures related to our current tax positions through tax expense and tax expense for discontinued operations we evaluate the need for contingent tax liabilities on a quarterly basis and any changes in estimates are recorded in our results of operations it could take several years to resolve certain of these contingencies

in this section we discuss our results of operations on a consolidated basis and on a segment basis for each of our financial reporting segments for items included in contribution margin our segments include retail energy wholesale energy and other operations for additional information about our segments see “business” in item 1 of this form 10k and note 18 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

business overview 

  

strategies and objectives 

  

we believe that competitive electricity markets benefit customers and will continue to expand although at varying paces across the country our objective is to be a leader in the progression to competitive markets by creating and delivering superior customer value building a great company to work for and achieving financial strength and flexibility as part of this objective we intend to focus on three strategies 

  

   

   

   

we intend to achieve these objectives through the following actions 

  

   

   

   

   

our ability to achieve these strategic objectives and executing these actions are subject to a number of factors some of which we may not be able to control see “cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information” and “— risk factors” in this form 10k 

  

in 2004 and 2003 we took a number of actions that reflect our commitment to meet these challenges 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

although we have taken a number of actions to reposition our business to meet current market conditions we continue to face a number of near and longterm challenges the operations of our wholesale energy segment continue to be negatively affected by depressed market conditions in addition we believe that competition in the texas retail energy market will increase and over time result in lower margins in this business until 2007 when the “pricetobeat” tariff is scheduled to expire we will continue to be exposed to regulatory risk associated with our residential customer sales in the houston market which represented approximately 35 of our retail energy segment revenues during 2004 these and other factors are discussed in more detail in “— risk factors” and other sections below in this form10k 

  

factors affecting future performance 

  

our retail energy segment historically has been the largest contributor of our consolidated income we expect however that this segment’s contribution to income relative to that of our wholesale energy segment will decline over time as a function of among other things expected longterm improvements in wholesale energy markets and declining margins in our texas retail market 

  

retail energy in 2005 we entered into an agreement with the puct staff regarding future adjustments to our “pricetobeat” if approved the agreement will provide for concurrent adjustments in our “pricetobeat” to reflect changes in the strandedcost components of centerpoint’s transmission and distribution rates in addition the agreement will eliminate a number of uncertainties regarding the timing of fuel factor adjustments in 2005 we expect however that the agreement will result in our achieving significantly less energy supply hedging benefits in 2005 compared to 2004 for additional information see “business — regulation — public utility commission of texas” 

  

in 2005 we expect that our retail energy segment will continue to experience a loss of “pricetobeat” customers due to customers switching to other suppliers however we intend to offset this impact by retaining andor adding new customers entering new markets and continuing our efforts to control costs other factors that will have a positive or negative impact on this segment’s results of operation include a market usage adjustments in ercot and other regions as described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and b weather conditions which have an impact on customer demand 

  

wholesale energy in 2005 we expect that the results of operations of our wholesale energy segment will improve based on a a projected fullyear of plant operations by our seward facility and improved availability of coalfueled generation plants and b increased demand in key wholesale markets including california and pjm market to maintain this improvement we intend to continue our ongoing program to manage and control costs divest nonstrategic assets and otherwise improve the operating efficiency of this segment 

  

liquidity in 2004 and 2003 we generated 549 million and 750 million in cash flows from continuing operations before changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities going forward we expect that our business will continue to generate a significant amount of cash flows from operations in addition we expect that our maintenance and capital expenditures will continue to be significantly less than our depreciation expense after meeting our expenses and working capital requirements we intend to use a significant portion of our remaining cash flow to prepay debt

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about nontrading and trading activities and related market risks tableend   

market risks and risk management 

  

we are exposed to various market risks these risks arise from the ownership of our assets and operation of our business most of our results of operations and cash flows from our business activities are impacted by market risks our market risk exposures primarily relate to commodity prices and interest rates 

  

during the normal course of business we review our hedging strategies and determine the hedging approach we deem appropriate based upon the circumstances of each situation we routinely utilize derivative instruments such as futures physical forward contracts swaps and options to mitigate the impact of changes in electricity natural gas and fuel prices on our results of operations and cash flows in addition we use derivatives to manage and hedge exposures to changes in interest rate risk on our floatingrate borrowings we believe that the associated market risks of these energy and interest rate derivative instruments can best be understood relative to the underlying assets or risk being hedged and our hedging strategy 

  

in march 2003 we discontinued our proprietary trading business trading positions taken prior to our decision to exit this business are managed solely for purposes of closing them on economical terms see note 6b for discussion of the types of activities that were classified as trading activities in our historical results of operations 

  

for information regarding our risk control framework see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements the effectiveness of our policies and procedures for managing risk exposures can never be completely estimated or fully assured for example we could experience losses from unexpectedly large or rapid movements or disruptions in the energy markets from regulatorydriven market rule changes andor bankruptcy of customers or counterparties in addition the reduction in market liquidity may impair the effectiveness of our risk management procedures and hedging strategies these and other factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

  

nontrading market risks 

  

commodity price risk  commodity price risk is an inherent component of wholesale and retail electric businesses prior to the energy delivery period we attempt to hedge in part the economics of our wholesale and retail electric businesses derivative instruments are used to mitigate exposure to variability in future cash flows from probable anticipated future transactions attributable to a commodity risk 

  

the following table sets forth the fair values of the contracts related to our net nontrading derivative assets and liabilities 

  

    

   

   

the fair values in the above table are subject to significant changes based on fluctuating market prices and conditions changes in our derivative assets and liabilities result primarily from changes in the valuation of the portfolio of contracts and the timing of settlements the most significant parameters impacting the value of our portfolios of contracts include natural gas and power forward market prices volatility and credit risk market prices assume a normal functioning market with an adequate number of buyers and sellers providing market liquidity insufficient market liquidity could significantly affect the values that could be obtained for these contracts as well as the costs at which these contracts could be hedged 

  

we assess the risk of our nontrading derivatives using a sensitivity analysis method derivative instruments create exposure to commodity prices which in turn offset the commodity exposure inherent in our business the sensitivity analysis performed on our nontrading energy derivatives measures the potential loss in fair value based on a hypothetical 10 movement in the underlying energy prices an increase of 10 in the market prices of energy commodities from their december 31 2004 levels would have decreased the fair value of our nontrading energy derivatives by 93 million of this amount 124 million relates to a loss in fair value of our nontrading derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges and 31 million relates to a gain in earnings of our hedges that are not designated as cash flow hedges a decrease of 10 in the market prices of energy commodities from their december 31 2003 levels would have decreased the fair value of our nontrading energy derivatives by 70 million of this amount 63 million relates to a loss in fair value of our nontrading derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges and 7 million relates to a loss in earnings of our hedges that are not designated as cash flow hedges 

  

the above analysis of the nontrading energy derivatives utilized for hedging purposes does not include the favorable impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on our physical purchases and sales of natural gas and electric power to which the hedges relate therefore the adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of nontrading energy derivatives held for hedging purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions assuming 

  

   

   

   

if any of the abovementioned assumptions cease to be true a loss on the derivative instruments may occur or the options might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date whichever comes first nontrading energy derivatives which qualify as cash flow hedges and which are effective as hedges may still have some percentage that is not effective the change in value of the nontrading energy derivatives which represents the ineffective component of the cash flow hedges is recorded in our results of operations during 2004 2003 and 2002 we recognized losses of 17 million 18 million and 1 million respectively in our results of operations due to hedge ineffectiveness 

  

as discussed in note 6a to our consolidated financial statements we often sell natural gas contracts “short” in order to offset our “long” position in power capacity related to our retail energy operations in texas the related accounting treatment marktomarket basis could result in significant fluctuations in earnings due to changes in natural gas prices during the third quarter of 2004 we discontinued our use of the “normal purchase exception” and began electing marktomarket accounting treatment for certain new power capacity commitments to partially offset potential marktomarket volatility in such short positions of natural gas in addition as discussed in note 6a to our consolidated financial statements effective july 1 2004 we dedesignated our cash flow hedges related to overthecounter and exchange traded forward contracts for natural gas power and basis swaps in the west region and began marking those contracts to market through earnings due to the dedesignation of these forward contracts as hedges in the west region we could experience significant fluctuations in earnings in periods prior to contract settlement due to changes in the prices of natural gas and power 

  

interest rate risk we have issued longterm debt and have obligations under bank facilities that subject us to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates in addition we have entered into interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with certain of our floating rate debt instruments on our floating rate debt we are most vulnerable to changes in the london interbank offered rate we assess interest rate risks using a sensitivity analysis method the table below provides information concerning our financial instruments for our continuing operations which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 

  

    

   

trading market risk 

  

for information regarding our historical trading activities see note 6b to our consolidated financial statements the following table sets forth our legacy net trading derivative assets liabilities by segment 

  

   

the following table sets forth the fair values of the contracts related to our legacy net trading derivative assets and liabilities 

  

   

for information regarding “prices actively quoted” “prices provided by other external sources” and “prices based on models and other valuation methods” see discussion above related to nontrading derivative assets and liabilities 

  

the fair values in the above table are subject to significant changes based on fluctuating market prices and conditions for further discussion of items resulting in changes in the valuation of the portfolio of trading contracts see discussion above related to nontrading derivative assets and liabilities 

  

the following table sets forth our realized and unrealized trading margins 

  

   

below is an analysis of our net trading derivative assets and liabilities 

  

    

   

we primarily assess the risk of our legacy trading positions using a valueatrisk method in order to maintain our total exposure within authorized limits valueatrisk is the potential loss in value of trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time period within a specified confidence level we utilize the parametric variancecovariance method with deltagamma approximation to calculate valueatrisk 

  

our valueatrisk limits are set by the audit committee of our board of directors risk limits for our legacy trading activities include both valueatrisk as well as other nonstatistical measures of portfolio exposure the risk management process supplements the measurement and enforcement of the limit metrics with additional analyses including stress testing the portfolio for extreme events 

  

our valueatrisk model utilizes four major parameters 

  

   

   

   

   

assuming a confidence level of 95 and a oneday holding period if valueatrisk is calculated at 10 million we may state that there is a one in 20 chance that if prices move against our consolidated diversified positions our pretax loss in liquidating or offsetting with hedges our applicable portfolio in a oneday period would exceed 10 million 

  

while we believe that our assumptions and approximations are reasonable for calculating valueatrisk there is no uniform industry methodology for estimating valueatrisk and different assumptions andor approximations could produce materially different valueatrisk estimates an inherent limitation of valueatrisk is that past market risk may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk moreover valueatrisk calculated for a specified holding period does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within that specified period future transactions market volatility reduction of market liquidity failure of counterparties to satisfy their contractual obligations andor a failure of risk controls could result in material losses from our legacy trading positions 

  

the following table presents the daily valueatrisk for substantially all of our legacy trading positions 

  

    

credit risk 

  

credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from nonperformance of contractual obligations by a counterparty credit risk is inherent in our commercial activities for a discussion of our credit risk and policies see note 6c to our consolidated financial statements 

  

the following table includes derivative assets and accounts receivable from our wholesale energy and ercot power supply counterparties and large commercial industrial and governmentalinstitutional customers after taking into consideration netting within each contract and any master netting contracts with counterparties as of december 31 2004 

  

    

   

   

derivative assets and accounts receivable are presented separately in our consolidated balance sheets the derivative assets and accounts receivable are setoff separately in our consolidated balance sheets although in most cases contracts permit the setoff of derivative assets and accounts receivable within a given contract for the purpose of disclosing the credit risk all assets and liabilities within a given contract were setoff if the counterparty has entered into a contract with us that permits such setoff

     our business operations consist of two principal business segments

      retail energy  provides electricity and related services to retail
       customers primarily in texas and acquires and manages the electric
       energy capacity and ancillary services associated with supplying these
       retail customers and

to our consolidated financial statements

                                 retail energy

     our retail energy segment provides electricity products and services to
enduse customers ranging from residential and small commercial customers to
large commercial industrial and institutional customers the operations of our
retail energy segment are primarily in texas in 2003 we began providing retail
energy products and services to small and large commercial industrial and
institutional customers in new jersey and maryland in 2004 we intend to the
extent market conditions are attractive to begin retail energy sales to
commercial industrial and institutional customers in other areas of the pjm
market including pennsylvania we are also evaluating the possibility of making
similar sales to customers in the miso market

residential and small commercial services  services business

     in texas we provide standardized electricity and related products and
services to residential and small commercial customers with a peak demand for
power up to approximately one mw as of december 31 2003 we had approximately
16 million residential customers and 210000 small commercial accounts in
texas making us the second largest retail electric provider in the state the
majority of our customers are in the houston area but we also have customers in
other areas including dallas and corpus christi texas

     in the houston area the texas electric restructuring law currently
requires us as a former affiliate of the transmission and distribution utility
in houston to sell electricity to residential customers only at a specified
price or pricetobeat outside of the houston area we are generally
permitted to sell electricity at unregulated prices to residential and small
commercial customers for information regarding the puct regulation of pricing
to residential and small commercial customers see  regulation below

     we currently provide retail electric service to residential customers only
in texas we have no nearterm plans to provide retail electric service to
residential customers outside of texas

commercial industrial and institutional services  solutions business

     in texas we market electricity and energy services to large commercial
industrial and institutional customers ie customers with a peak demand of
greater than approximately one mw in new jersey and maryland we market
electricity and energy services to commercial industrial and institutional
customers

                                        6
page

our commercial industrial and institutional customers include refineries
chemical plants manufacturing facilities hospitals universities governmental
agencies restaurants and other facilities in general we sell electricity to
these customers at unregulated prices

     as of december 31 2003 we had contracts to provide an aggregate of 5735
mw of electricity to approximately 820 customers in texas and an aggregate of
490 mw of electricity to approximately 120 customers in the pjm market the
terms of our contracts range from 1 to 51 months with the average term being 21
months we also provide customized energy solutions including energy
information services and products to our commercial industrial and
institutional customers for information regarding revenues from enduse retail
customers see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations  retail energy

retail energy supply

     in texas we must purchase from third parties substantially all of the
generation capacity necessary to supply our retail energy business as of
february 20 2004 we had entered into contracts to purchase generation capacity
averaging 9944 mw per month in 2004 2914 mw per month in 2005 and 1000 mw
per month in 2006 based on current market conditions existing retail sales
commitments and current load forecasts we estimate that these contracts will
supply approximately 87 of the current capacity requirements of our retail
energy business for the remainder of 2004 and 47 of our estimated 2005
requirements

     the largest supplier of generation capacity for our texas retail energy
business was texas genco we expect to continue to contract with third parties
including texas genco for a significant portion of our texas retail energy
business power requirements including purchases pursuant to power purchase
agreements and auctions of power conducted by texas generation companies in
addition we may seek to supplement our marketbased purchases of power over
time with the purchase of individual generation assets

     in january 2004 we elected not to exercise our option to purchase
centerpoints ownership interest in texas genco for information regarding our
decision not to exercise the option to purchase centerpoints interest in texas
genco see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements

     in states outside of texas we generate sufficient capacity to supply our
retail needs

regulation

     texas public utility commission  we are through our operating
subsidiaries certified to provide retail electric service to residential small
commercial and large commercial industrial and institutional customers in
texas

     the texas electric restructuring law currently regulates the prices at
which we can sell electricity to residential and small commercial customers
outside of the houston area we generally are permitted to sell electricity at
unregulated prices to these customers however in the houston area we can sell
electricity to residential customers only at a specified price or
pricetobeat this requirement will continue until january 1 2005 at which
time we will also be able to sell at prices other than the pricetobeat
starting january 1 2007 we will be able to sell without pricing restrictions

     prior to january 2004 we were required to sell electricity to small
commercial customers in the houston area only at the pricetobeat however
that restriction has expired we are now able to sell electricity without
pricing restrictions so long as we continue to make the pricetobeat available
as an alternative for houston area customers until january 1 2007 as of
december 31 2003 the pricestobeat for residential customers and small
commercial customers were 1105 cents per kwh for a residential customer using
1000 kwh per month and 854 cents per kwh for a small commercial customer using
15000 kwh per month

                                        7

     the pricetobeat includes a base rate component established by the puct in
1999 and an adjustable energy supply component or fuel factor we can apply for
adjustments in the fuel factor twice a year based on changes in the average
12month forward price of natural gas or changes in the price of purchased
energy in 2003 we requested and the puct approved two adjustments to our
pricetobeat fuel factor resulting in an 18 increase of our residential
pricetobeat in that year during 2002 and 2003 we requested and the puct
approved two adjustments in each period to our pricetobeat fuel factor as

     in 2004 the puct will determine the stranded costs of texas transmission
and distribution utilities in accordance with procedures established under the
texas electric restructuring law following this determination we expect that
the puct will review our pricetobeat if at that time the average 12month
forward price of natural gas is lower than the average price reflected in our
then current pricetobeat fuel factor we expect the puct to lower our
pricetobeat fuel factor in addition we expect that the puct will adjust at
that time the base rate component of our pricetobeat that reflects the non
bypassable rates that texas transmission and distribution utilities charge us to
include any stranded cost charges nonbypassable rates include various fixed
charges established by the puct under the texas electric restructuring law we
estimate that the puct review of our pricetobeat will occur in the fourth
quarter of 2004 or the first quarter of 2005 we cannot however predict at
this time the outcome of the pucts review

     the texas electric restructuring law requires that we make a payment to
centerpoint unless as of december 31 2003 retail electric providers other
than us supplied 40 or more of the electricity consumed by houston area
residential customers we estimate the payment to be 175 million and expect
that the payment will be made in the fourth quarter of 2004 for information
regarding our accruals for this payment see note 14d to our consolidated
financial statements

generally sell electricity at market prices we market electric energy capacity
and ancillary services we procure natural gas coal fuel oil natural gas
transportation and storage capacity and other energyrelated commodities to
supply and manage our physical assets in march 2003 we discontinued our
proprietary trading business trading positions taken prior to our decision to
exit this business are managed solely for purposes of closing them on economical
terms

     as of december 31 2003 we owned had an interest in or leased 124
operating electric power generation facilities with an aggregate net generating
capacity of 19442 mw in six regions of the united states the generating
capacity of our facilities consists of approximately 30 of baseload 5910
mw 40 of intermediate 7689 mw and 30 of peaking capacity 5843 mw as
of december 31 2003 we had under construction 1111 mw of additional baseload
net generating capacity one facility under construction 591 mw reached
commercial operation in february 2004 the other facility under construction is
expected to reach commercial operation in the third quarter of 2004

     in 2003 we sold one facility having a total net generating capacity of 588
mw and retired from service a total of five powergenerating units having a
total net generating capacity of 579 mw we currently have mothballed four units
having a total net generation capacity of 824 mw in february 2004 we announced
our plans to mothball andor retire an additional 20 generating units 727 mw
from certain peaking plants and units that serve the pjm market subject to a
review of certain reliability issues with regulators depending on future market
conditions in the wholesale power industry we may sell retire mothball or
dispose of additional generation assets

midatlantic region

     as of december 31 2003 we owned had an interest in or leased 21
operating electric power generation facilities with an aggregate net generating
capacity of 5393 mw located in pennsylvania new jersey and maryland the
generating capacity of these facilities consists of approximately 34 of
baseload 1863 mw 42 of intermediate 2243 mw and 24 of peaking capacity
1287 mw

     we are constructing a 520 mw waste coalfired baseload unit at an existing
facility located in pennsylvania that is expected to reach commercial operations
in the third quarter of 2004 the 520 mw unit will replace two generating units
at the facility that were retired in 2003 the retired generating units had 197
mw of total net generating capacity

4 we announced in february 2004 that we intend to mothball approximately 111
    mw of net generating capacity at this facility

5 pjm has informed us that due to technical constraints within its
    transmission system our 866 mw generation facility located at hunterstown
    pennsylvania cannot be dispatched during certain periods when high levels
    of electricity are flowing on the central interface these conditions are
    generally experienced during periods of moderate electricity demands in the
    midwest with higher electricity demands in the east we are in discussions
    with pjm and first energycorp the utility to which our plant
    interconnects concerning a resolution of this constraint

6 in the first quarter of 2004 we retired two units with a total net
    generating capacity of 232 mw

7 we announced in february 2004 that we intend to retire this facility

commercial operations

     energy  we sell electric energy generation capacity and ancillary service
products to a variety of power customers including investorowned utilities
municipalities cooperatives and other companies that serve end users we sell
these products in hourahead dayahead forward bilateral and iso markets the
following table identifies the principal markets associated with each of our
regional generation assets

     certain of our principal markets most notably new york and the pjm market
have rules that in certain instances may impose limits or caps on the price at
which we can sell electricity in addition the market authorities in certain
regions have the authority to compel us to operate our generation facilities in
order to maintain the reliability of the local grid system under these
circumstances we are entitled to receive a mitigated price for electricity
dispatched into the system that is intended to enable us to recoup our
incremental operating costs plus a designated surcharge

     in addition to standard market products we also provide full requirements
polr and basic generation service contracts these nonstandard contracts
afford higher margin opportunities than standard market products however they
include additional risks that we may not be able to mitigate these risks are
primarily volumetric uncertainty driven by weather and customer switching for
information regarding longterm sales arrangements for electric energy capacity
and ancillary services see note 14f to our consolidated financial statements

     fuel  to ensure an adequate supply of fuel we purchase natural gas coal
and fuel oil for our generation plants from a variety of suppliers under daily
monthly and forward contracts these contracts generally include either index or
fixed price provisions in connection with the operation of our natural gas
fired plants we also arrange for schedule and balance natural gas from our
suppliers and through transporting pipelines to perform these functions and
satisfy our electric generation needs we contract for a variety of
transportation arrangements under shortterm longterm firm and interruptible
agreements with pipelines and storage facilities in spite of our efforts any
given facility may experience supply constraints from time to time

     risk management  to manage the risk of our assets we seek to sell energy
and purchase fuel on a forward basis through fixed price or tolling contracts
we are required by policy to maintain a oneforone balance between the
amount of required fuel for each megawatt of power sold off our gas generation
assets we have similar oneforone hedging policies for the hedging of
certain pipeline and storage positions

     although we enter into hedging activities related to our generation
facilities pipelines and storage positions we do not engage in proprietary
trading with respect to power fuel emissions or any other energy commodities
with respect to positions taken prior to our decision in 2003 to exit
proprietary trading we are managing such positions solely for the purpose of
closing such positions on economical terms

regulation

     electricity  the ferc has exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale
sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce
by public utilities public utilities that are subject to the fercs
jurisdiction must file rates with the ferc the ferc has authorized our
generation subsidiaries to sell electricity and certain related services at
wholesale under marketbased rates in addition certain ancillary services are
sold at costbase rates

     under certain circumstances the ferc can revoke or limit marketbased rate
authority if the ferc revokes or limits marketbased rate authority the
affected party would be required to obtain approval from the ferc of costbased
rate schedules in order to make wholesale sales in addition the loss of
marketbased rate authority could subject the affected party to the accounting
record keeping and reporting requirements that the ferc imposes on public
utilities with costbased rate schedules

     in november 2003 the ferc issued new rules intended to prevent market
abuse the new rules address market manipulation and other abusive practices
under the rules parties found to have engaged in prohibited behavior are
subject to disgorgement of unjust profits and possible revocation of their
marketbased rate authority

     the ferc has issued a notice of proposed rules intended to standardize
electricity markets and eliminate discrimination in transmission service by
requiring that all users of the transmission grid take service pursuant to the
same terms and conditions of service thus eliminating certain preferences
enjoyed
                                        19
page

by classes of users the new rules would require transmissionowning public
utilities to join an iso or rto in addition the ferc seeks to establish
dayahead and realtime electric energy and ancillary service markets modeled
after the energy markets that currently exist in the northeastern united states
the rules contemplate the regional adoption of resource adequacy measures and
regional price mitigation measures it is not possible for us at this time to
predict the timing of the implementation of these rules or their ultimate impact
on our business

     gas activities  the ferc has issued a blanket certificate permitting us to
sell natural gas in interstate commerce in connection with the management of our
natural gas positions

     hydroelectric facilities  we operate our hydroelectric generation
facilities pursuant to ferc licenses these licenses which periodically must be
renewed typically include conditions regarding the operation of the facility

     sec  a company engaged exclusively in the business of owning andor
operating facilities used for the generation of electric energy exclusively for
sale at wholesale and selling electric energy at wholesale may be exempted from
regulation under the puhca as an exempt wholesale generator our electric
generation subsidiaries either have received determinations of exempt wholesale
generator status from the ferc or are companies that own or operate qualifying
facilities that are exempt from puhca if any of our subsidiaries lose their
exempt wholesale generator status or qualifying facility status we would have
to restructure our organization or risk being subjected to further regulation by
the sec

                                other operations

     our other operations business segment includes primarily unallocated
corporate costs and our minor equity and other investments as of december 31
2003 the net book value of these investments was 32 million our activities
with respect to these investments are limited to managing and in some cases
liquidating our existing portfolio we have no plans to expand this business
for additional information regarding this segment see note 21 to our

                             environmental matters

     we are subject to numerous federal state and local requirements relating
to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of personnel and
the public these requirements relate to a broad range of our activities
including the discharge of compounds into the air water and soil the proper
handling of solid hazardous and toxic materials and waste noise and safety and
health standards applicable to the workplace environmental regulations
affecting us include but are not limited to

      the clean air act and the 1990 amendments to the act as well as state
       laws and regulations impacting air emissions including state
       implementation plans related to existing and new national ambient air
       quality standards for ozone and fine particulate matter owners andor
       operators of air emissions sources are responsible for obtaining permits
       compliance and reporting

      the federal water pollution control act which requires permits for
       facilities that discharge treated wastewater into the environment

      cercla which can require any individual or entity that may have owned or
       operated a disposal site as well as transporters or generators of
       hazardous wastes sent to such site to share in remediation costs

                                        20

      the solid waste disposal act as amended by the resource conservation and
       recovery act which requires certain solid wastes including hazardous
       wastes to be managed pursuant to a comprehensive regulatory regime

      the national environmental policy act which requires consideration of
       potential environmental impacts by federal agencies in their decisions
       including siting approvals

      the ferc which regulates the approval and relicensing of hydroelectric
       facilities

     in order to comply with these requirements we will as necessary spend
substantial funds to construct modify and retrofit equipment and clean up or
decommission disposal or fuel storage areas and other locations as necessary we
anticipate spending approximately 178 million from 2004 through 2008 for
environmental compliance of which 16 million is for remediation for more
information on environmental matters involving us including possible liability
and capital costs see note 15a to our consolidated financial statements

air quality matters

     the federal clean air act requires the epa to define standards for air
quality that are protective of public health as a result of setting these
standards the epa has implemented a number of emission control programs that
affect industrial sources including power plants in addition the 1990
amendments to the clean air act directed epa to implement programs designed to
control acidic deposition acid rain improve visibility in the united states
pristine areas and national parks regional haze and reduce emissions of
hazardous air pollutants

  regulation of nox and so2 emissions

     as a result of the mandates of the clean air act the epa has implemented
programs limiting emissions of nox and so2 both of which are compounds that
result from the combustion of fossil fuels nox is a precursor to the
formation of ozone acid rain fine particulate matter and regional haze so2
is a precursor to the formation of acid rain fine particulate matter and
regional haze in addition to regulations already implemented the epa in
december 2003 proposed a new regulation to control emissions of nox and so2
on a broad scale this new proposed regulation is referred to as the interstate
air quality rule and will affect our power generating facilities in the eastern
united states and texas

     the interstate air quality rule would require reductions in nox and so2
beyond levels already required in existing federal programs in 29 states in the
eastern united states the proposed rules will require reductions of nox and
so2 in two phases although the final form of the proposed regulations is not
yet known the first phase which takes effect in 2010 would require
approximately a 50 reduction in so2 and nox emissions on an annual basis
the second phase which would take effect in 2015 would require approximately a
70 reduction in so2 and nox on an annual basis these reductions would be
achieved through a trading program allowing reductions to be made at the most
economical locations and not requiring reductions on a facilitybyfacility
basis the proposed rules would affect primarily our facilities in the eastern
united states particularly the coalfired facilities and texas we are unable
at this time to estimate the potential impact on the future operations of our
generation facilities

  regulation of emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants

     in december 2003 the epa also proposed two regulations to control
emissions of mercury from coalfired power plants in the united states only one
of these two regulations will ultimately be adopted in december 2004 the mact
standard would require reductions on a facilitybyfacility basis regardless of
cost the mact rule would require reductions to be achieved by 2008 the other
rule referred to as the capandtrade rule would effect the emission
reductions on a national scale through a trading program allowing reductions to
be made at the most economical locations and not requiring reductions on a
facilitybyfacility basis although the final form of these proposed
regulations is not yet known the mact standard would require a reduction of
about 30 from each of our coal fired facilities which

                                        21
page

would require the installation of control equipment the capandtrade rule
would require larger reductions but may be more economical because it allows
trading of emissions among facilities like the interstate air quality rule the
mercury capandtrade rule would be accomplished in two phases in 2010 and
2018 with reduction levels set at approximately 50 and 70 respectively if
the capandtrade rule were ultimately adopted our approach would be to balance
capital expenditures for controls and reliance on allowance markets to achieve
compliance we are unable at this time to estimate the potential impact on the
future operations of our generation facilities

     in addition to mercury control from coalfired boilers the mact rule if
adopted would require the control of nickel emissions from oilfired
facilities while the final form of these provisions is uncertain we do not
expect this provision of the mact to have a material impact on our operations
since only a small number of our facilities are oilfired

     the epa has also proposed or issued mact standards for sources other than
boilers used for power generation the mact rule for combustion turbines was
issued in august 2003 and there is no material impact on existing facilities we
expect the mact rulemaking for engines and industrial boilers to be finalized in
early 2004 based on the current form of the proposed rules for these source
types we do not anticipate that the rules if adopted will have a material
impact on our operations

  clear skies act

     in february 2002 the white house announced its clear skies initiative
the proposal is aimed at longterm reductions of multiple pollutants produced
from fossil fuelfired power plants reductions averaging 70 are targeted for
sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxide and mercury if approved by the united states
congress this program would entail a marketbased approach using emission
allowances compliance with emission limits would be phased in over a period
from 2008 to 2018 the clear skies initiative is similar to the proposed
interstate air quality rule and mercury mactcapandtrade rule

  air quality enforcement issues

     the epa is conducting a nationwide investigation regarding the historical
compliance of coalfueled electric generating stations with various permitting
requirements of the clean air act specifically the epa and the united states
department of justice have initiated formal enforcement actions and litigation
against several other utility companies that operate these stations alleging
that these companies modified their facilities without proper preconstruction
permit authority since june 1998 eight of our coalfired facilities have
received requests for information related to work activities conducted at those
sites the epa has not filed an enforcement action or initiated litigation in
connection with these facilities at this time nevertheless any litigation if
pursued successfully by the epa could accelerate the timing of emission
reductions anticipated as a result of proposed regulations and result in the
imposition of penalties

     the new jersey department of environmental protection has requested a copy
of all correspondence relating to one of the eight stations from the epa the
epa has also agreed to provide information relating to the new source review
investigations discussed above to the new york state attorney generals office
and the pennsylvania department of environmental protection

  greenhouse gas emissions

     the kyoto protocol which may become effective in 2004 if ratified by a
sufficient number of nations would require ratifying nations to achieve
substantial reductions of co2 and certain other greenhouse gases between 2008
and 2012 although the current united states government has indicated that it
does not intend to ratify the treaty at this time any future limitations on
power plant carbon dioxide emissions could have a material impact on all fossil
fuel fired facilities including those belonging to us

     there continues to be a debate within the united states over the direction
of domestic climate change policy the united states congress is currently
considering several bills that would impose

                                        22
page

mandatory limitation of co2 emissions for the domestic power generation
sector and several other states primarily in the northeastern united states
are considering statespecific or regional legislation initiatives to stimulate
co2 emission reductions in the electric utility industry the specific impact
will depend upon the form of emissionsrelated legislation or regulations
ultimately adopted by the federal government or states in which our facilities
are located

     in recent years we have instituted or participated in numerous proactive
projects and programs that go beyond regulatory compliance requirements in an
effort to reduce and remove greenhouse gas emissions these effective actions
include

      participation in the power partners program designed to encourage and
       facilitate industry actions to reduce greenhouse gas intensity as
       outlined in president bushs voluntary global climate change initiative

      participation in powertree an entity comprised of a diverse group of
       power generators that endeavors to remove co2 emissions through
       largescale reforestation projects

      independent establishment of a 540acre arboreal preserve in east texas
       to remove emissions

      operation of renewable energy facilities including hydroelectric and
       landfill gastoenergy facilities and

      recent retirement of co2 producing facilities in california new jersey
       and pennsylvania

water quality matters

     the epa and states periodically revise water quality criteria and initiate
total maximum daily load determinations under the clean water act these actions
may result in more stringent wastewater discharge limitations for our power
plants and the need to install additional water treatment systems or control
measures

     on february 16 2004 the epa signed final regulations relating to the
design and operation of cooling water intake structures at existing power
plants while there may be significant compliance costs associated with this
rule sitespecific evaluation of compliance alternatives will be required to
determine the magnitude of those potential costs

ferc matters

     in the course of the ferc licensing proceedings various agencies have
requested increased flow rates downstream of our hydroelectric dams in order to
enhance fish habitats and for other purposes the ferc has imposed conditions in
the new licenses to increase such flow rates and we expect that the ferc will
also impose similar conditions in the licenses for which applications remain
pending increased flow rates may affect revenues for these facilities due to
the loss of use of water for power generation we do not however expect such
lost revenues to be material to the economic viability of such facilities

other

     as a result of their age many of our facilities contain significant
amounts of asbestos insulation other asbestos containing materials as well as
leadbased paint existing state and federal rules require the proper management
and disposal of these potentially toxic materials we have developed a
management plan that includes proper maintenance of existing nonfriable
asbestos installations and removal and abatement of asbestos containing
materials where necessary we have planned for the proper management abatement
and disposal of asbestos and leadbased paint at our facilities in our financial
planning

     under cercla and similar state laws owners and operators of facilities
from or at which there has been a release or threatened release of hazardous
substances together with those who have transported or arranged for the
disposal of those substances are liable for the costs of responding to that
release or threatened release and the restoration of natural resources damaged
by any such release we are not

                                        23

aware of any liabilities under the act that would have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

       environment conducive to the development of a highly focused and
       motivated team

      we intend to strengthen our balance sheet by a enhancing our
       profitability b divesting nonstrategic assets and c accessing the
       capital markets to repay bank debt with the proceeds from offerings of
       fixed income or equity securities

      in order to capitalize on our competitive advantages we intend to focus
       on regions where we believe the rules support competitive markets to
       link our generation assets to customer loads and to capitalize on our
       unique retail skill set

     our ability to achieve our strategies and objectives are subject to a
number of factors some of which we may not be able to control see cautionary
statement regarding forwardlooking information and  risk factors

     in 2003 and 2004 we have taken a number of actions intended to reduce our
debt strengthen our balance sheet and allow us to focus on our core
business  generating supplying and marketing electricity to customers

      in march 2003 we discontinued our proprietary trading activities see
       note 7b to our consolidated financial statements

      in march 2003 we refinanced 59 billion of bank credit facilities with
       new facilities that mature in approximately four years see note 9a to
       our consolidated financial statements

      in june and july 2003 we issued 11 billion in senior secured notes and
       275 million in convertible senior subordinated notes and used the net
       proceeds of the senior secured notes to prepay debt thereby satisfying
       the only mandatory principal payment required under our march 2003 credit
       facilities prior to maturity

      in august 2003 we reviewed our internal cost structure and identified
       140 million of annualized savings opportunities of which 25 million was
       realized in 2003 and 125 million is expected to be realized in 2004

      as part of our ongoing evaluation of our wholesale energy business we
       a recognized an impairment of 985 million of goodwill in this segment
       b retired 489 mw of plant assets and mothballed 824 mw of plant assets
       in 2003 that no longer made economic sense to currently operate and c
       sold our 588 mw desert basin plant operations and recorded an aftertax
       loss on the sale of 75 million see notes 6 and 23 to our consolidated
       financial statements in february 2004 we announced our plans to
       mothball andor retire an additional 727 mw from certain peaking plants
       and units that serve the pjm market subject to a review of certain
       reliability issues with regulators

      we a settled investigations by the cftc relating to certain trading and
       price reporting issues b settled all inquiries investigations and
       proceedings instituted by the ferc involving us in connection with the
       fercs ongoing review of western energy markets except the pending ferc
       refund proceeding and c settled an investigation by the sec concerning
       allegations of violations of federal securities law see note 15 to our
       consolidated financial statements

      in december 2003 we completed the sale of our european energy operations
       and recognized a loss on sale of 310 million in order to reduce debt
       and allow us to focus exclusively on our united states operations see
       note 22 to our consolidated financial statements

      in december 2003 we finalized a second amendment to our march 2003
       credit facilities in connection with the amendment we used 917 million
       that had accumulated in an escrow account including a the net sale
       proceeds of our desert basin plant b a portion of the net sale
       proceeds of our european energy operations and c the net proceeds of
       our convertible senior subordinated notes to prepay debt under our march
       2003 credit facilities the amendment will give us greater flexibility to
       purchase selected generating assets to support our retail business in
       texas in connection with this amendment we also canceled our 300
       million senior priority facility see note 9a to our consolidated
       financial statements

      in january 2004 we made the decision to not exercise our option to
       purchase centerpoints 81 ownership interest in texas genco in favor of
       pursuing a strategy of contracting for a significant portion of our
       retail energy supply requirements and over time pursuing potential
       acquisitions of individual generation assets

      consistent with our business objectives and strategies in february 2004
       we announced that we intend to reduce our net debttoadjusted ebitda
       ratio significantly by the end of 2006 consistent with this plan we
       have targeted an additional 200 million in cost reductions these
       reductions are in addition to our 140 million cost reduction plan
       discussed above

     although we have taken a number of actions in 2003 and early 2004 to
restructure our business to meet current market conditions we continue to face
a number of near and longterm challenges the operations of our wholesale
energy segment continue to be negatively affected by depressed market
conditions these and other factors are discussed in more detail in  risk
factors and other sections below

     as part of our efforts to simplify the corporate structure to reflect a
single operating company we are evaluating a possible change in our reportable
segments in future reporting periods

     interest income  we recognized interest income from third parties of 35
million for 2003 as compared to 28 million for 2002 the increase is primarily
due to interest income of 13 million recorded during 2003 compared to 5

in california see note 15b to our consolidated financial statements

     income tax expense  during 2002 our effective tax rate was 462 our

     interest income  we recognized interest income from third parties of 28

to interest income of 5 million recorded during 2002 recognized on receivables

                            ebit by business segment

     the following tables present operating income loss and ebit for each of
our business segments for 2001 2002 and 2003 the primary performance measure
used by management to evaluate segment performance is ebit from continuing
operations which at the segment level represents all profits or losses from
continuing operations both operating and nonoperating before deducting
interest and taxes management believes ebit is a good indicator of each
segments operating performance as it represents the results of operations
without regard to financing methods or capital structure in addition we
believe ebit from continuing operations is used by our investors as a
supplemental financial measure in the evaluation of our consolidated results of
operations items excluded from ebit are significant components in understanding
and assessing our financial performance additionally our computation of ebit
may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other
companies because all companies do not calculate it in the same fashion for a
reconciliation of our operating income loss to ebit and ebit to net income
loss see below

retail energy

     our retail energy segment provides electricity products and services to
customers ranging from residential and small commercial customers to large
commercial industrial and institutional customers for a description of our
retail energy segment see our business  retail energy in item 1 of this
report and note 21 to our consolidated financial statements

     in 2002 and 2003 our retail energy segment was the largest contributor of
income and cash flow we view the retail business as relatively stable in the
current competitive environment we expect given current trends in the
wholesale energy markets that this segment will be the primary contributor to
our consolidated operating results in 2004 as the competitive market place in
texas evolves we expect to lose residential and small commercial market share
in the houston market we expect based on current trends that these customer
losses will be partially offset by gains in residential and small commercial
market share in other areas our efforts to gain customers outside of the
houston area may require us to increase our spending for marketing and
advertising although our retail energy segment has recently expanded operations
to focus on gaining commercial industrial and institutional customers in the
pjm market its primary market continues to be texas we expect to continue to
renew contracts with a significant portion of our large commercial industrial
and institutional customers in the texas and pjm markets and where possible
add new customer contracts for information regarding texas pricetobeat
regulations and other factors that could have a material impact on the results
of operations of our retail energy segment see our business  retail energy
and  risk factors

     we estimate a portion of our retail electricity sales and services and our
energy supply costs see critical accounting estimates within this section
during 2003 we revised our estimates and assumptions related to 2002 and
accordingly recognized 39 million of income in our results of operations in
2003 related to 2002 these amounts are based on the latest information we have
to date and as additional information becomes available we will continue to
recognize income andor losses in future periods related to our historical
results of operations

     as a part of our february 2004 cost reduction plan we expect to
restructure certain aspects of this segment which may result in charges to
earnings reflecting severance and other restructuring costs

     as described in note 2d to our consolidated financial statements
effective january 1 2003 we discontinued the use of marktomarket accounting
for electricity sales to large commercial industrial and institutional
customers under executed contracts and the related energy supply contracts for
contracts executed prior to october 25 2002 the discontinuation of
marktomarket accounting was a result of our adoption of eitf no 0203 in
addition beginning october 1 2003 we adopted eitf no 0311 which requires
us to report a significant amount of our nontrading commodity hedging
activities on a net as opposed to a gross basis accordingly our financial
results are not comparable between 2002 and 2003

                                        39

     we must contract with other generatorssuppliers to supply the majority of
our obligations we purchase and sell electricity supply in the market as a
means to manage our energy supply for example we may purchase power in one
zone of texas and subsequently resell that power and purchase power in another
zone of texas based on changing energy supply needs prior to october 1 2003
these transactions are recorded as gross revenues and purchased power and are
disclosed in revenues from resales of purchased power and other hedging
activities and purchased power and delivery fees as applicable

     the 942 million increase in revenues from enduse retail customers is due
to a increases in the pricetobeat for residential and small commercial
customers in the houston area b an increase in large commercial industrial
and institutional customers rates that are indexed to the price of natural gas
and new fixedprice contracts that were executed at higher prices c a 9
increase in residential customers and sales volumes and d an increase in sales
volumes to large commercial industrial and institutional customers these
increases were partially offset by a decrease in small commercial customers our
revenues from resales of purchased power and other hedging activities decreased
due to changes in our strategies for risk management and hedging our electric
energy supply

to a 13 million loss for 2001 the 533 million increase in ebit was primarily
due to the commencement of full competition which began january 1 2002 and
resulted in increased margins related to retail electric sales to residential
small commercial and large commercial industrial and institutional customers
the increase in margins was partially offset by increased operating expenses as
further discussed below

wholesale energy

     as of december 31 2003 our wholesale energy segment owned or leased
electric power generation facilities with an aggregate net operating generating
capacity of 19442 mw exclusive of units retired or mothballed for a
description of the wholesale energy segment see our business  wholesale
energy in item 1 of this report and note 21 to our consolidated financial
statements

     the ebit of our wholesale energy segment has declined significantly since
2001 primarily as a function of depressed market conditions in 2003 the ebit
of this segment was also negatively affected by an 80 million trading loss in
the first quarter of that year in march 2003 we discontinued our proprietary
trading business

                                        43
page

     in 2003 we a recognized an impairment of 985 million of goodwill in
this segment b retired 489 mw of plant assets and mothballed 824 mw of plant
assets and c sold our 588 mw desert basin plant see notes 6 and 23 to our
consolidated financial statements in february 2004 we announced our plans to
mothball andor retire an additional 727 mw from certain peaking plants and
units that serve the pjm market subject to a review of certain reliability
issues with regulators

     based on current trends we do not anticipate that conditions in the
wholesale energy markets are likely to improve significantly in 2004 however
we believe that the wholesale energy market is cyclical and that conditions will
ultimately improve for information regarding factors that could have a material
impact on the results of operations of our wholesale energy segment see
 risk factors

     as part of our february 2004 cost reduction plan we expect to restructure
certain aspects of this segment which may result in charges to earnings
reflecting severance and other restructuring costs

energy segment for 2001 2002 and 2003

2 in july 2003 the eitf issued eitf no 0311 which became effective october
    1 2003 at that time we began reporting prospectively the settlement of
    sales and purchases of fuel and purchased power related to our nontrading
    commodity derivative activities that were not physically delivered on a net
    basis in our results of operations based on the item hedged pursuant to eitf
    no 0311 this resulted in decreased revenues and decreased fuel and cost
    of gas sold and purchased power of 666 million for the fourth quarter of
    2003 we believe the application of eitf no 0311 will continue to result
    in a significant amount of our nontrading commodity derivative activities
    being reported on a net basis prospectively that were previously reported on
    a gross basis we did not reclassify amounts for periods prior to october 1
    2003 see note 2d to our consolidated financial statements

1 see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements

     revenues  our wholesale energy segments revenues excluding trading
margins decreased 11 billion in 2003 compared to 2002 the decrease is
primarily due to a the application of eitf no 0311 which reduced 2003
revenues by 666 million see note 2d to our consolidated financial
statements and b a 14 decrease in power sales volumes the decrease is
partially offset by a a 4 increase in prices for power sales partially due to
increased gas costs b 209 million of changes in our refund obligation and
credit reserves for energy sales in california see note 15b to our
consolidated financial statements and c 184 million due to the inclusion of
a full years results of orion powers operations in 2003 as the acquisition
occurred in february 2002 our revenues from power sales and other hedging
activities decreased due to changes in our strategies and our liquidity
constraints for risk management hedging and optimizing of our generation
portfolio

     fuel and cost of gas sold and purchased power  our wholesale energy
segments fuel and cost of gas sold and purchased power decreased 13 billion
in 2003 compared to 2002 the decrease is primarily due to a the application
of eitf no 0311 which reduced 2003 fuel and cost of gas sold and purchased
power by 666 million see note 2d to our consolidated financial statements
and b decreased purchased power volumes and a decrease in prices of purchased
power as a result of our hedging activities see above

     trading margins  trading margins decreased 185 million in 2003 compared
to 2002 the decrease is primarily due to the discontinuance of proprietary
trading in march 2003 and a pretax loss of approximately 80 million in
connection with a financial gas spread position during the month of february
2003 in addition the reduced market liquidity driven by the industrys
restructuring contributed to the decrease the decrease was partially offset by
the impact of positive reserve and valuation adjustments

                                  risk factors

     the following risk factors should be considered carefully together with the
risk factors and contingencies described in business in item 1 of this report
 liquidity and capital resources below and notes 14 and 15 to our
consolidated financial statements the risks described in this section are not
the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to
us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could also have a material
impact on our business operations

risks relating to selling electricity

  the wholesale and retail electricity markets are highly competitive

     the market for wholesale and retail electricity customers is very
competitive in certain markets our principal competitors include the local
regulated electric utility or its nonregulated affiliate in other markets we
face competition from independent electric providers independent power
producers and

                                        51
page

wholesale power providers in many cases our competitors have the advantage of
longstanding relationships with customers longer operating histories andor
larger and better capital resources

     in general we compete on the basis of price our commercial and marketing
skills relative to other market participants service and our financial
position other factors affecting our competitive position include our ability
to obtain at competitive prices fuel supplies to operate our generation plants
electricity for resale and related transportationtransmission services since
many of our energy customers suppliers and transporters require financial
guarantees and other assurances regarding contract performance our access to
credit support is another factor affecting our ability to compete in the market

     our largest market for residential electricity customers is the houston
market as a former affiliate of centerpoint we are required by the puct to
sell electricity to residential customers at a specified price or
pricetobeat if competing electric suppliers are able to sell electricity at
prices below the pricetobeat we risk losing a significant number of our
residential customers to other providers see  special risks relating to the
texas market below and our business  retail energy  regulation in item 1
of this report

  our business is subject to market risks the impact of which we cannot fully
  mitigate

     unlike a traditional regulated electric utility we are not guaranteed a
rate of return on our capital investments we sell electric energy capacity and
ancillary services and purchase fuel under short and longterm contractual
obligations and through various spot markets our results of operations
financial condition and cash flows depend in large part upon prevailing market
prices for electricity and fuel in our markets market prices may fluctuate
substantially over relatively short periods of time potentially adversely
affecting our results of operations financial condition and cash flows changes
in market prices for electricity and fuel may result from the following factors
among others

      weather conditions

      seasonality

      demand for energy commodities and general economic conditions

      forced or unscheduled plant outages

      disruption of electricity or gas transmission or transportation
       infrastructure or other constraints or inefficiencies

      addition of generating capacity

      availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources

      availability and levels of storage and inventory for fuel stocks

      natural gas crude oil and refined products and coal production levels

      the financial position of market participants

      changes in market liquidity

      natural disasters wars embargoes acts of terrorism and other
       catastrophic events and

      governmental regulation and legislation

     we operate a significant number of power generation plants to operate
these plants we must enter into commitments with various terms for fuel and
transmission capacity or services although we attempt to hedge these purchases
against our commitments to sell in the future it is not possible to hedge all
of our generation plant output beyond certain defined periods and thus changes

  in marketing our products we rely on power transmission facilities that we do
  not own or control if these facilities fail to provide us with adequate
  transmission capacity we may not be able to deliver power to our customers

     we depend on power transmission and distribution facilities owned and
operated by utilities and others to deliver energy products to our customers if
transmission or transportation is inadequate or disrupted our ability to sell
and deliver our products may be hindered any infrastructure failure that
interrupts or impairs delivery of electricity or natural gas could have a
material adverse effect on our business

  we are dependent on metering systems that we do not own or control failure to
  receive accurate and timely information could have a material adverse impact
  on our business

     we are dependent on the transmission and distribution utilities for reading
our customers energy meters we also rely on the local transmission and
distribution utility or in some cases the independent system operator to
provide us with our customers information regarding energy usage and we may be
limited in our ability to confirm the accuracy of the information if we receive
incorrect or untimely information from the transmission and distribution
utilities we will have difficulty properly billing our customers and collecting
amounts owed to us failure to receive correct and timely information could have
a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and
cash flows for information regarding data collection and other billing risks

accounting estimates below

risks relating to ownership of generation assets

  operation of power generation facilities involves significant risks that could
  negatively affect our results of operations financial condition and cash
  flows

     as of december 31 2003 we own an interest in or lease 124 operating
electric generation facilities our operation of generation assets exposes us to
risks relating to the breakdown of equipment fuel supply interruptions
shortages of equipment material and labor and other operational risks in
addition significant portions of our facilities were constructed many years
ago older generating equipment even if maintained in accordance with good
engineering practices may require significant capital expenditures to add to or
upgrade equipment to maintain efficiency to comply with changing environmental
requirements or to provide reliable operations such expenditures affect our
operating costs any unexpected failure to produce power including failure
caused by breakdown or forced outage could have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

  our insurance coverage may not be sufficient and our insurance costs may
  increase

     we have insurance coverage subject to various limits and deductibles
covering our generation facilities including property damage insurance and
general liability insurance in amounts that we consider appropriate

     however we cannot assure you that insurance coverage will be available in
the future on commercially reasonable terms or that the insurance proceeds
received for any loss of or any damage to any of our generation facilities will
be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our
results of operations and financial condition the costs of our insurance
coverage have increased significantly during recent years and may continue to
increase in the future

regulatory risks

  our operations are subject to extensive regulation changes in these
  regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of
  operations financial condition and cash flows

     we operate in a regulatory environment that is undergoing significant
changes as a result of varying restructuring initiatives at both the state and
federal levels we cannot predict the future direction of these
                                        53
page

initiatives or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment
will have on our business moreover existing regulations may be revised or
reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable
to our facilities or our commercial activities such future changes in laws and
regulations may have a detrimental effect on our business for additional
information see our business  retail energy  regulation and our
business  wholesale energy  regulation in item 1 of this report and note 15
to our consolidated financial statements

     the ferc and independent system operators have imposed and may continue to
impose price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms in an attempt to
address some of the price volatility in these markets additionally federal
legislative initiatives have been introduced to address the problems being
experienced in some power markets we cannot predict whether such proposals will
be adopted or their impact on industry restructuring if the trend towards
competitive restructuring of the wholesale power markets is reversed
discontinued or delayed our business growth prospects and financial results
could be adversely affected

  if we fail to obtain or maintain any necessary governmental permit or
  approval we may not be able to operate our plants

     the ownership and operation of power generation facilities require numerous
permits approvals and certificates from federal state and local governmental
agencies the operation of our generation facilities must also comply with
environmental protection and other legislation and regulations most of our
generation facilities are exempt wholesale generators that sell electricity
exclusively into the wholesale market these facilities are subject to
regulation by the ferc regarding rate matters although the ferc has authorized
us to sell electricity produced from these facilities at market prices the ferc
retains the authority to modify or withdraw our marketbased rate authority and
to impose cost of service rates any reduction by the ferc of the rates we may
receive for our generation activities may adversely affect our business results
of operations financial condition and cash flows

  our costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant and the cost
  of compliance with new environmental laws could adversely affect our results
  of operations and cash flows

     our generation facilities in particular our coalfired plants are subject
to extensive environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities
we are required to comply with numerous environmental laws and regulations and
to obtain numerous governmental permits in operating our facilities we may
incur significant costs to comply with these requirements if we fail to comply
with these requirements we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties
including fines existing environmental regulations can be revised
reinterpreted or become applicable to our facilities or new laws and regulations
could be adopted if any of these events occur our business results of
operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely
affected for more information regarding compliance with environmental laws see
our business  environmental matters and note 15 to our consolidated
financial statements

special risks relating to the texas market

  our results of operations could be materially affected by decisions of the
  puct regarding the pricetobeat and related regulatory matters

     the puctapproved price or pricetobeat that we are required to charge
for residential electricity sales and must make available to small commercial
customers in the houston area includes a component to reflect the market price
of fuel and purchased power costs this component commonly known as the fuel
factor was originally established in 2001 and is fixed until such time as the
puct grants an adjustment under current puct rules we can apply for an
adjustment not more than twice a year if we can demonstrate there have been
significant changes in the market price of natural gas or purchased energy to
serve retail customers to the extent that there are significant changes in the
market price of natural gas or purchased energy and we do not adjust the fuel
factor or there is a significant delay in the

                                        54
page

timing of these adjustments our results of operations financial condition and
cash flows could be materially adversely affected

     the puct and the ercot iso which oversees the ercot region have and may
continue to modify the market structure and other market mechanisms seek to
revise andor modify or reinterpret existing regulations in ways that could have
a material impact on our business in the texas market in addition we may be
subject to new state laws and regulations that are adopted or become applicable
to our commercial activities in this region any of these actions could have a
material adverse effect on our business

  we are dependent upon third party providers of capacity and energy to supply
  our retail customer obligations in texas

     we do not own sufficient generating resources in texas to supply all of the
electricity requirements of our retail business in this market our inability to
contract for our supply requirements or the failure of our suppliers to perform
their contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on our
business for additional information see our business  retail
energy  retail energy supply and note 4 to our consolidated financial
statements

  the ercot iso has experienced a number of problems with its information
  systems since the advent of competition in the texas market our operating
  results may be adversely affected if these problems are not alleviated

     the ercot isos responsibilities include ensuring that information relating
to a customers choice of retail electric provider including data needed for
ongoing servicing of customer accounts is conveyed in a timely manner to the
appropriate parties

     problems in the flow of information between the ercot iso the transmission
and distribution utilities and the retail electric providers have resulted in
delays and other problems in enrolling and billing customers when all involved
parties do not successfully process customer enrollment transactions ownership
records in the various systems supporting the market are not synchronized
properly and subsequent transactions for billing and settlement are adversely
affected the impact can include us not being the electric providerofrecord
for intended or agreed upon time periods delays in receiving customer
consumption data that is necessary for billing as well as the incorrect
application of rates or prices and wholesale imbalances in our electricity
supply and actual sales

     the ercot iso is also responsible for handling scheduling and settlement
for all electricity supply volumes in the ercot region the ercot iso plays a
vital role in the collection and dissemination of metering data from the
transmission and distribution utilities to the retail electric providers we and
other retail electric providers schedule volumes based on forecasts which are
based in part on information supplied by the ercot iso to the extent that
these amounts are not accurate or timely we could have incorrectly estimated
our scheduled volumes and supply costs

     see critical accounting estimates in this section of the report for
additional information

  payment defaults by other retail electric providers to ercot could have a
  material adverse effect on our business

     in the event of a default by a retail electric provider of its payment
obligations to ercot the portion of the obligation that is unrecoverable by
ercot is assumed by the remaining market participants in proportion to each
participants load ratio share we would pay a portion of the amount owed to
ercot should such a default occur if ercot is not successful in recovering such
amounts the default of a retail electric provider in its obligations to ercot
could have a material adverse effect on our business

risks related to our capital structure

  we have significant debt that could negatively impact our business

     as of december 31 2003 we had total consolidated debt of 61 billion
our high level of debt could

      limit our ability to obtain additional financing to operate our business

      limit our financial flexibility in planning for and reacting to business
       and industry changes

      place us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to less leveraged
       companies

      increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry
       conditions including changes in interest rates and volatility in
       commodity prices or a general decline in economic activity and

      require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to
       payments on our debt thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow
       for other purposes including our operations capital expenditures and
       future business opportunities

  despite current indebtedness levels we and our subsidiaries may still be able
  to incur substantially more debt

     as of december 31 2003 our credit and other debt agreements permitted us
to incur additional borrowings of up to 11 billion if new debt is added to
our current debt levels the related risks that we now face could increase see
note 9 to our consolidated financial statements

  if we do not generate sufficient positive cash flows we may be unable to
  service our debt

     our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay principal and
interest on debt depends on our or our subsidiaries future operating
performance if our or our subsidiaries cash flows and capital resources are
insufficient to allow us or our subsidiaries to make scheduled payments on the
debt we may have to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek
additional capital restructure or refinance the debt or sell equity we cannot
assure you that the terms of our debt will allow these alternative measures or
that such measures would satisfy our scheduled debt service obligations

     if we default

      our debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to
       be due and payable

      our secured debt lenders and bondholders could terminate their
       commitments and commence foreclosure proceedings against our assets and

      we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation

  we may not have adequate liquidity to post required amounts of additional
  collateral

     if commodity prices increase substantially in the near term our liquidity
could be severely strained by requirements under our commodity agreements to
post additional collateral

     in certain cases our counterparties have elected not to require us to post
collateral to which they are otherwise entitled under certain agreements
however these counterparties retain the right to request such collateral
factors that could trigger increased demands for collateral include additional
adverse changes in our industry negative regulatory or litigation developments
andor changes in commodity prices based on current commodity prices we
estimate that as of february 20 2004 we could be contractually required to
post additional collateral of up to 243 million related to our operations

  the terms of our debt may severely limit our ability to respond to changes in
  our business

     our credit facilities and other debt instruments restrict our ability to
take specific actions in responding to changes in our business without the
consent of our debt holders even if such actions may be in our best interest
                                        56
page

     our credit facilities also require us to maintain specified financial
ratios and meet specific financial tests

     in addition our credit facilities and other debt instruments contain
covenants that among other things restrict our ability to

      pay dividends and other distributions

      incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock

      enter into asset sales

      enter into transactions with affiliates

      grant liens on assets to secure debt

      engage in certain business activities and

      engage in mergers or consolidations and transfers of assets

  failure to comply with the covenants in our credit facilities and other debt
  instruments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
  and cash flows

     our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by many events
beyond our control and our future operating results may make it impossible for
us to comply with the covenants or in the event of a default to remedy that
default our failure to comply with these financial covenants or with the other
restrictions in our credit facilities and other debt instruments could result in
a default which could cause the applicable debt holders to declare that
indebtedness to become immediately due and payable if we are unable to repay
those amounts the holders of our debt could proceed against the collateral
granted to them to secure the related indebtedness and take other legal action
against us if those lenders accelerate the payment of our debt we cannot
assure you that we could pay that indebtedness immediately and continue to
operate our business

  an increase in our interest rates could adversely affect our cash flows

     as of december 31 2003 we had 40 billion of outstanding floating rate
debt any increase in shortterm interest rates would result in higher interest
costs and could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition
and cash flows while we may seek to use interest rate swaps or other derivative
instruments to hedge portions of our floatingrate exposure we may not be
successful in obtaining hedges on acceptable terms

  our noninvestment grade credit ratings and the perceived negative credit
  worthiness of merchant energy companies in the financial markets could
  adversely affect our ability to access capital on acceptable terms
  commercialize our assets and engage in hedging activities

     our credit ratings are below investment grade and are likely to remain
below investment grade for the foreseeable future our noninvestment grade
credit ratings may continue to limit our ability to refinance our debt
obligations and access the capital markets on terms that are favorable to us in
addition to the extent that our credit ratings remain below investment grade
we are required under many commercial contracts to pledge cash collateral post
letters of credit or provide other similar credit support these requirements
constitute a significant constraint on our liquidity and cash resources may
negatively impact our ability to operate our business and could adversely affect
our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

general business risks

  our strategic plans may not be successful

     our future results of operations are dependent on the success of our
strategic plans as discussed in managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations  overview

     in restructuring our operations we may encounter certain risks for
example in exiting certain markets and business activities we may forego
opportunities to participate in potential business opportunities in addition
as we review and make changes in our internal cost structure we likely will
incur increased shortterm costs due to severance payments and restructuring
processes it is also possible that in restructuring and simplifying our
operations we may increase the risk of an impairment of certain assets such as
information technology systems to the extent that changes in our business
eliminate the need for such assets

     as part of our costreduction efforts we intend to consolidate a number of
our internal risk controls and other support functions and make significant
reductions in our corporate overhead there is a potential that control systems
designed for our previous operational structure may prove inadequate for our new
operational structure and have to be redesigned in addition new risks may be
encountered for which we have no existing control system we believe that our
internal controls will continue to be effective and adequate for our
restructured operations although there could be increased risks as a result of
reduced personnel and changing processes including information technology
systems

     although we believe that the wholesale energy market is cyclical and that
conditions will ultimately improve there can be no assurance regarding the
certainty timing or magnitude of such improvement

  the ultimate outcome of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings to which we are a
  party could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
  financial condition and cash flows

     we are party to numerous lawsuits and regulatory proceedings relating to
our historical trading and wholesale energy activities in addition various
state and federal governmental agencies have commenced investigations relating
to these activities including the california attorney general the ferc and
criminal investigations by the united states attorneys for the northern district
of california and the state of texas the ultimate disposition of some of these
matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
financial condition and cash flows for additional information see note 15 to
our consolidated financial statements

  our results of operations and our ability to access capital and insurance
  could be adversely affected by terrorist attacks or related acts of war

     the uncertainty associated with the military activity of the united states
and other nations and the risk of future terrorist activity may affect our
results of operations and financial condition in unpredictable ways these
actions could result in adverse changes in the insurance markets and disruptions
of power and fuel markets in addition our generation facilities or the power
transmission and distribution facilities could be targets of terrorist activity
the risk of terrorist attacks or acts of war could also adversely affect the
united states economy create instability in the financial markets and as a
result adversely affect our ability to access capital on terms and conditions
acceptable to us

  our business operations expose us to the risk of nonperformance by
  counterparties

     our operations are exposed to the risk that counterparties who owe us money
or physical commodities and services such as power natural gas or coal will
not perform their obligations many of our counterparties in the energy markets
have belowinvestment grade credit rankings if these counterparties fail to
perform we might be forced to seek alternative hedging arrangements or replace
the underlying commitment at thencurrent market prices in this event we might
incur additional losses see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about
nontrading and trading activities and related market risks  credit risk in

                        liquidity and capital resources

     in this section we discuss the principal sources of capital resources
required for us to operate our business we also identify known trends demands
commitments events or uncertainties that may affect our current and future
liquidity or capital resources in the last part of this section we provide
information regarding our historical cash flows

sources of liquidity and capital resources

     our principal sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows
from operations borrowings under our various revolving credit facilities
proceeds from certain debt offerings and equity offerings and securitization of
assets

     cash flows from operations  all of our operations are conducted by our
subsidiaries as a result reliant resources cash flow is dependent upon the
receipt from its subsidiaries of cash dividends distributions or other
transfers of cash generated by their operations in 2002 and 2003 the primary
source of cash flows from operations was from our retail energy segment we
expect that our retail operations will continue to be our primary source of
operating cash flows through at least 2004 for a description of factors that
could affect the cash flows from operations see  risk factors above and

    or distribution of which is effectively restricted by the terms of financing
    agreements but is otherwise available to the applicable subsidiary for use
    in satisfying certain of its obligations

     all of our major credit and other debt agreements contain restrictive
covenants failure to comply with these covenants could have a number of
effects including limitations on our ability to make additional borrowings
under our credit facilities increases in borrowing costs and the acceleration
of indebtedness for additional information regarding these covenants and the
impact of a default under these covenants on our ability to borrow funds see
 risk factors and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements

     shelf registration  we currently have an effective shelf registration that
allows us to issue up to an aggregate of 35 billion in securities we have not
yet issued any securities under this registration statement however we may
from time to time sell any combination of debt securities common stock
preferred stock and warrants in one or more offerings up to 35 billion

     factors affecting future sources of liquidity and capital
resources  although we are committed to identifying opportunities through
restructuring our business operations and otherwise to reduce our liquidity
needs it is possible that we may need to incur additional debt or to issue
equity or convertible instruments subject to restrictions contained in our
credit facilities and other debt agreements to meet future obligations our
ability to supplement our liquidity and capital resources could be affected by a
number of factors including those discussed under  risk factors above in
particular the following factors could affect our ability to raise additional
financings

      general economic conditions including economic conditions in the
       financial and capital markets and the availability of credit in such
       markets

      the financial markets expectations regarding

       the current and future performance and cash flows of our retail energy
        and wholesale energy operations

       the success of our efforts to reduce our cost structure and restructure
        our operations and

       our ability to successfully manage regulatory litigation and other
        risks

      the financial markets expectations regarding any plans we may have to
       issue additional equity or incur additional debt for purposes of
       acquiring individual ercot generating plants and

      our credit ratings as discussed in more detail below

     although we have completed a number of financing transactions in 2003 we
anticipate that continuing depressed conditions within the wholesale electric
markets our subinvestment grade credit ratings and other uncertainties will
continue to have an impact on our ability to borrow funds on acceptable terms
if we require but are unable to obtain additional sources of financing to meet
our future capital requirements our financial condition and future results of
operations could be materially adversely affected

     we cannot assure that these ratings will remain in effect for any given
period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or
withdrawn entirely by a rating agency we note that these credit ratings are not
recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and may be revised or
withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies each rating should be evaluated
independently of any other rating for a discussion of the impact of previous
downgrades in our credit ratings on our capital requirements see
 contractual obligations and contractual commitments below

liquidity and capital requirements

     our liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of our
working capital needs capital expenditures debt service requirements and
collateral requirements examples of working capital needs include purchases of
fuel and electricity plant maintenance costs including required environmental
expenditures and corporate costs such as payroll

     in 2003 we began a review of our operating structure with the objective of
reducing our costs during 2003 we identified 140 million of annualized
savings opportunities of which 25 million was realized in 2003 and 125 million
is expected to be realized in 2004 consistent with our business objectives and
strategies described in  overview in february 2004 we announced that we
intend to reduce our net debttoadjusted ebitda ratio significantly by the end
of 2006 consistent with this plan we have targeted an additional 200 million
in cost reductions in addition we have curtailed plans to construct any new
generation plants apart from the completion of projects that we are
contractually committed to complete retired or mothballed generation units
that are no longer economic to operate and have sold noncore business
operations and assets eg our european energy operations with the
implementation of these strategies we are seeking to restructure our operations
and business with the objective of achieving by the end of 2006 credit metrics
consistent with those that rating agencies currently ascribe to companies with
investment grade status our ability to achieve this objective is subject to a
number of assumptions including our future economic performance see  risk
factors

     in 2004 we intend to continue to identify and pursue opportunities to
restructure our business operations in order to reduce our costs and our
liquidity and capital requirements however our ability to reduce our cost
structure while maintaining prudent operating standards is limited in
addition we may incur shortterm costs in the form of severance payments and
other restructuring costs as part of our efforts to reduce our cost structure
finally there is a risk that in restructuring our operations to focus on our
core markets we may be precluded from exploring business opportunities in other
markets

    midwests and orion nys future cash flows from operations will be
    sufficient to meet the scheduled principal payments and required
    prepayments we anticipate refinancing any remaining outstanding borrowings
    prior to or upon maturity

     as a result of our march 2003 refinancing and our june and july 2003
capital markets debt issuances our interest expense has increased
substantially for additional information see note 9 to our consolidated

     in certain cases our counterparties have elected not to require us to post
collateral to which they are otherwise entitled under certain agreements
however these counterparties retain the right to request such collateral
factors that could trigger increased demands for collateral include additional
adverse changes in our industry negative regulatory or litigation developments
andor changes in commodity prices based on current commodity prices we
estimate that as of february 20 2004 we could be contractually required to
post additional collateral of up to 243 million related to our operations as
of february 20 2004 we had 31 million in unrestricted cash and cash
equivalents and 959 million available under committed corporate facilities

     we are involved in a number of legal environmental and other proceedings
before courts and governmental agencies we are also subject to ongoing
investigations by various governmental agencies although we cannot predict the
outcome of these proceedings many of these matters involve substantial claim
amounts which in the event of an adverse judgment could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

statements

offbalance sheet arrangements

     in this section we discuss our offbalance sheet arrangements that have or
are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our
financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses
results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources an
offbalance sheet arrangement is any transaction agreement or other contractual
arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has a
made guarantees b a retained or a contingent interest in

                                        63
page

transferred assets c an obligation under derivative instruments classified as
equity or d any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an
unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit
risk support to the company or that engages in leasing hedging or research and
development arrangements with the company

     in 2002 we formed a qualified special purpose entity as a bankruptcy
remote subsidiary and entered into a receivables facility arrangement which we
amended in 2003 this arrangement with certain financial institutions allows
them to purchase up to 350 million of undivided interests in our accounts
receivable from certain retail customers see notes 2c and 16 to our
consolidated financial statements we believe it improves cash flows while
serving as a source of liquidity for our operations

     in 2000 we established three separate saleleaseback transactions in
connection with the acquisition of the rema facilities we used this offbalance
sheet arrangement to finance in part the acquisition of these facilities see
notes 2c and 14a to our consolidated financial statements

     certain offbalance sheet transactions that we do not expect to have a
current or future material effect on our results of operations financial
condition or cash flows are disclosed in notes 8 and 14e to our consolidated
financial statements we also discuss certain arrangements to facilitate the
development construction financing and leasing of three power generation
projects which we consolidated the subsidiaries effective january 1 2003 in
notes 2c 9 and 14b to our consolidated financial statements

1 decrease in net cash outflows from 568 million in 2001 to 246 million in
    2002 due to decrease in cash used to meet working capital and other assets
    and liabilities requirements see further analysis below

2 increase in net cash inflows from 612 million in 2001 to 789 million in
    2002 due primarily to cash flows provided by our retail energy segment for
    retail sales in 2002 due to the texas retail market opening to full
    competition in january 2002 partially offset by a decline in cash flows of
    our wholesale energy segment due to a decline in operating results

 1 due to both our retail energy segments and wholesale energy segments
     results of operations see  ebit by business segment

 2 cash inflows related to our trading and hedging activities as margin
     deposits were primarily replaced with letters of credit

 3 decrease primarily related to decrease in power sales volumes in our
     wholesale energy segment

     commercial industrial and institutional customers and the related energy
     supply contracts which were previously recognized as unrealized earnings
     in prior periods see note 2d to our consolidated financial statements

 5 decrease primarily due to net tax refunds primarily federal of 75
     million received in 2003

 6 see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements

 7 decrease primarily associated with the decrease in purchased power and fuel
     purchases in our wholesale energy segment as a result of decreased hedging
     activities

 8 purchases relate to our retail energy segments hedging activities

 9 increase primarily related to funds dedicated for the support of lease
     obligations of rema and activities of orion ny see note 2l to our

  cash flows  investing activities

     2003 compared to 2002  net cash provided byused in investing activities
changed by 45 billion in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to the
acquisition of orion power for 29 billion in 2002 in addition cash flows
provided by investing activities of our discontinued operations increased 15
billion in 2003 compared to 2002 see below

     2002 compared to 2001  net cash used in investing activities increased
26 billion in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to the acquisition of orion
power for 29 billion in 2002 in addition cash flows from investing
activities of our discontinued operations changed by 231 million in 2002
compared to 2001

     year ended december 31 2003  net cash provided by investing activities
during 2003 was 10 billion primarily due to cash inflows of 16 billion from
our discontinued operations primarily due to net proceeds from the sales of our
desert basin plant operations 285 million and our european energy operations
14 billion see notes 22 and 23 to our consolidated financial statements
this was offset by cash outflows due to capital expenditures of 587 million
primarily related to our power generation operations and development of power
generation projects

     year ended december 31 2002  net cash used in investing activities during
2002 was 35 billion primarily due to the acquisition of orion power for 29
billion in february 2002 and 640 million in capital expenditures primarily
related to our power generation operations and development of power generation
projects this was offset by cash inflows of 119 million from our discontinued
operations primarily due to a 137 million cash dividend from our discontinued
european energy operations equity investment in nea

     year ended december 31 2002  net cash provided by financing activities
during 2002 of 40 billion is primarily due to an increase in shortterm
borrowings used to fund the acquisition of orion power and an increase in
working capital to meet future obligations and other working capital
requirements in addition net cash provided by financing activities increased
due to decreased investments of excess cash in an affiliate of centerpoint
these cash inflows were partially offset by a the purchase of 200 million in
principal amount of the orion power holdings 45 convertible senior notes and
b the payment of 145 million under our orion midwest and orion ny credit
agreements see note 9a to our consolidated financial statements

     year ended december 31 2001  net cash provided by financing activities
during 2001 of 10 billion is primarily due to net proceeds from the ipo of
17 billion offset by 731 million of changes in notes with affiliated
companies and a 189 million treasury stock purchase pursuant to the terms of
the master separation agreement with centerpoint we used 147 million of the
net ipo proceeds to repay certain indebtedness owed to centerpoint proceeds not
initially utilized from the ipo during 2001 were advanced on a shortterm basis
to centerpoint which provided a cash management function as of december 31
2001 we had 390 million of outstanding advances to centerpoint during 2001

critical accounting estimates

     as required by gaap we make a number of estimates and judgments in
preparing our consolidated financial statements these estimates to the extent
they differ from actual results can have a significant impact on our recorded
assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities in this section we discuss those estimates that we deem
to be critical accounting estimates we consider an estimate to be a material
critical accounting estimate due to either a the level of subjectivity or
judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or b the
susceptibility of such matters to change and that have a material impact on the
presentation of our financial condition or results of operations the audit
committee of our board of directors reviews each critical accounting estimate
with our senior management

  goodwill

     as of november 1 of each year we test goodwill for each of our segments
in addition we test goodwill if an event occurs indicating that an asset
carrying value may not be recoverable the following table shows net goodwill by
reportable segment for the indicated period

goodwill   32      1509        1541       53       430          483


     in 2001 we determined goodwill associated with our communications business
was impaired and recorded a goodwill impairment of 19 million that was reported
in amortization expense in 2002 we recognized impairment charges totaling 716
million related to our european energy segment goodwill 234 million reported
as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and 482 million
reported as a component of loss from discontinued operations in 2003 we
recognized impairment charges totaling 985 million related to our wholesale
energy reporting unit for information regarding impairment charges reflected in
the reported periods in our consolidated financial statements see note 6 to our
consolidated financial statements

     we estimate the fair value of our wholesale energy segment based on a
number of subjective factors including a appropriate weighting of valuation
approaches income approach market approach and comparable public company
approach b projections about future power generation margins

                                        69
page

c estimates of our future cost structure d discount rates for our estimated
cash flows e selection of peer group companies for the public company
approach f required level of working capital g assumed terminal value and
h time horizon of cash flow forecasts

     we consider the estimate of fair value to be a critical accounting estimate
for our wholesale energy segment because a a potential goodwill impairment
could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations
and b the estimate is based on a number of highly subjective judgments and
assumptions we do not consider the estimate of fair value and goodwill of our
retail energy segment to be a critical accounting estimate as our prior
estimates of fair value for that reporting unit significantly exceeded the
carrying value

     in determining the fair value of our wholesale energy segment in 2003 we
made the following key assumptions a the markets in which we operate will
continue to be deregulated b demand for electricity will grow which will
result in lower reserve margins c there will be a recovery in electricity
margins over time to a level sufficient such that companies building new
generation facilities can earn a reasonable rate of return on their investment
and d the economics of future construction of new generation facilities will
likely be driven by regulated utilities as part of our process we modeled all
of our power generation facilities and those of others in the regions in which
we operate the following table summarizes certain of these significant
assumptions



                                                            january    november    july   november

1 the numbers of years used in the internal cash flow analysis changed from 5
    years in the january 2002 test to 15 years due to the fact that five years
    in the forecast did not capture the full impact of the cyclical nature of
    our wholesale energy operations additional periods were included in the
    forecasts to derive an appropriate forecast period which was used to
    determine the estimated terminal value as of january 2002 based on current
    market conditions in the wholesale energy industry management did not
    believe additional periods beyond five years in the forecast were required

2 the ebitda multiple for terminal values changed from 60 in the january 2002
    test to 70 to 75 in the november 2002 test and from 70 to 75 in the
    november 2002 test to 75 in the 2003 tests due to the independent
    appraisers updated analysis of the public guideline companies that
    indicated higher multiples were appropriate to calculate the terminal values
    at the applicable dates

3 depending on the region the specific rate is projected to be somewhat
    higher or lower

4 based on our assumption in 2003 that regulated utilities will be the primary
    drivers underlying the construction of new generation facilities we have
    assumed that the aftertax return on investment will yield a return
    representative of a regulated utilitys cost of capital 75 rather than
    that of an independent power producer 90 based on changes in assumed
    market conditions including regulatory rules we have changed the projected
    time horizon for substantially achieving the aftertax return on investment
    to 2008  2012 depending on region formerly we had assumed that the
    time horizon for substantially achieving this rate of return was
    2006  2010

     because we recognized a goodwill impairment in 2003 in the near future if
our wholesale energy market outlook changes negatively we could have additional
impairments of goodwill that would need to be recognized in addition our
ongoing evaluation of our wholesale energy business could result in decisions to
mothball retire or dispose of additional generation assets any of which could
result in additional impairment charges related to goodwill impact our fixed
assets depreciable lives or result in fixed asset impairment charges

  california net receivables

     as described in note 15b to our consolidated financial statements we
have recorded a 189 million net receivable included in the 242 million below
as of december 31 2003 for energy sales in california during the period from
october 2 2000 through june 20 2001 the receivable is an estimate based on a

                                        70
page

number of assumptions regarding a the outcome of a ferc refund proceeding and
b the realizability of the receivables due to creditworthiness issues

     we consider this estimate which affects only our wholesale energy segment
to be a critical accounting estimate because a changes in this estimate can
have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and
b the estimate of the net receivable is based on a number of highly subjective
judgments and assumptions in estimating the net receivable we have made a
number of assumptions as set forth in the following table regarding a the
estimated refund obligation b the credit reserve and c the interest
receivable

     for information regarding related changes in our estimates see note 15b
to our consolidated financial statements

  property plant and equipment

     we evaluate our property plant and equipment for impairment if events
indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable if the
sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from an asset is less than
the carrying value of the asset we recognize an impairment by subtracting the
fair value of the asset from its carrying value we consider the fair value
estimate to be a critical accounting estimate because a an impairment can have
a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and b
the highly subjective nature of the many judgments and assumptions used in the
estimate the estimate of carrying value primarily affects our wholesale energy
segment which holds approximately 97 of our total net property plant and
equipment

     in determining the existence of an impairment in carrying value we make a
number of subjective assumptions as to a whether an indicator of impairment
has occurred b the grouping of assets c the intention of holding versus
selling an asset d the forecast of undiscounted expected future cash flow
over the assets estimated useful life and e if an impairment exists the fair
value of the asset or asset group if our wholesale energy market outlook
changes negatively we could have additional impairments of our property plant
and equipment in future periods additionally future decisions to mothball
retire or dispose of assets could result in impairment charges it is also
possible that in restructuring and simplifying our operations in the future as
discussed in  overview of this section we may increase the risk of an
impairment of certain assets such as information technology systems to the
extent that changes in our business eliminate the need for such assets

     during 2001 we decided to exit our communications business and recorded
fixed asset impairments of 22 million which is recorded in depreciation
expense see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements during 2002 we
recognized a 37 million impairment recorded in depreciation expense related to
steam and combustion turbines and two heat recovery steam generators see note
14c to our consolidated financial statements during 2003 we recognized
depreciation expense of 7 million related to the writedown of an office
building to its fair value less cost to sell which was determined with the
assistance of an independent appraiser

     for information concerning the possible impairment of our liberty plant
see note 15c to our consolidated financial statements

  depreciation expense

     as of december 31 2003 approximately 73 of our total gross property
plant and equipment was comprised of electric generation facilities and
equipment we estimate depreciation expense using the straightline method based
on projected useful lives we consider these estimates which affect primarily
our wholesale segment to be critical accounting estimates because a they
require subjective judgments regarding the estimated useful lives of property
plant and equipment and b changes in the estimates could affect future
depreciation expense and hence our results of operations

     in 2002 we recognized 15 million in depreciation expense for the early
retirement of power generation units at the warren facility during 2003 we
recognized 14 million in depreciation expense for the early retirement of power
generation units at two facilities for additional information regarding
depreciation expense see note 2f to our consolidated financial statements

     for power generation facilities purchased in acquisitions we estimate
useful life based on a the condition of the acquired facilities b the fuel
type of the generation facilities c future environmental requirements d
projected maintenance and e projected future cash flows for power generation
facilities that we construct we use the design life provided in the
construction contract in the absence of a specified design life we estimate
the weighted average life of the components of a power generation unit of a
facility

     significant portions of our facilities were constructed many years ago
older generating equipment may require significant upgrades which could affect
judgments to their useful life in addition alternative technologies could
reduce the useful lives of portions of these facilities

     if we had assumed that our gross property plant and equipments lives had
decreased by 10 from the estimated lives used in our calculation of
depreciation expense for 2003 our depreciation expense would have been
approximately 399 million or 11 higher

  trading and derivative activities

     legacy trading positions  we report our legacy trading positions on our
consolidated balance sheets at fair value as discussed in item 7a quantitative
and qualitative disclosures about nontrading and trading activities and related
market risks of this report we determine the fair value of our trading
assetsliabilities based on a prices actively quoted b prices provided by
other external sources or c prices based on models and other valuation
methods

     we consider the fair values of our trading assetsliabilities to be a
critical accounting estimate because they are highly susceptible to change from
period to period and are dependent on many subjective factors including a
estimated forward market price curves b valuation adjustments relating to
time value c liquidity valuation adjustments calculated by utilizing
observed market price liquidity which represent the estimated impact on fair
values resulting from the widening of bidask spreads for transactions occurring
further in the future d costs of administering future obligations under
existing contracts and e credit adjustments based on estimated defaults by
counterparties that are calculated using historical default probabilities for
corporate bonds for companies with similar credit ratings these estimates
affect our wholesale energy segment and prior to 2003 our retail energy
segment

     to determine the fair value for energy trading derivatives where there are
no market quotes or external valuation services we rely on modeling techniques
in certain circumstances prices are modeled using a variety of techniques such
as moving averages calibration models and other time series techniques market
equilibrium analysis extrapolationinterpolation a range of contingent claims
valuation methods and volumetric risk modeling there is inherent risk in
valuation modeling given the complexity and volatility of energy markets
therefore it is possible that results in future periods may be materially
different as contracts are ultimately settled

     nontrading derivative activities  we report our nontrading derivative
assetsliabilities on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value as
discussed in item 7a quantitative and qualitative

disclosures about nontrading and trading activities and related market risks
of this report we estimate the fair value of our nontrading derivative
assetsliabilities based on a prices actively quoted b prices provided by
other external sources or c prices based on models and other valuation
methods the fair values and deferred gains and losses of our nontrading
derivative instruments and contractual commitments qualifying and designated as
hedges are based on the same valuation techniques described above for energy
trading activities

     we consider the fair values of our nontrading derivative instruments to be
a critical accounting estimate due to the same factors applicable to our legacy
trading activities we also believe estimates regarding the probability that
hedged forecasted transactions will occur by the end of the time period
specified in the original hedging documentation to be a critical accounting
estimate these estimates affect all of our reportable operating segments

fair value of our nontrading derivatives at december 31 2002 and 2003

  retail energy segment estimated revenues and energy supply costs

     accrued unbilled revenues  in 2003 accrued unbilled revenues of 290
million represented approximately 3 of our consolidated revenues and 5 of our
retail energy segments revenues in 2002 accrued unbilled revenues of 216
million represented approximately 2 of consolidated revenues and 5 of our
retail energy segments revenues

     accrued unbilled revenues are based on our estimate of the amount of energy
delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading and on customer
metering information which we have limited ability to confirm furnished to us
by the ercot iso in estimating electricity usage volumes we rely upon daily
forecasted volumes estimated customer usage by class and applicable customer
rates based on analyses reflecting significant historical trends and experience
volume estimates by customers are then multiplied by our estimated rate by
customer class to calculate the unbilled revenues to be recorded we record the
unbilled revenues in the current reporting period and then reverse it in the
subsequent reporting period when actual usage and rates are known and billed

     we consider our estimate of accrued unbilled revenue to be a critical
accounting estimate because of a the uncertainty inherent in estimating
customer volumes b the problems or delays in the flow of information between
the ercot iso the transmission and distribution utilities and us and other
retail electric providers c the potential negative impact on our business
results of operation and cash flows based on the receipt of inaccurate or
delayed information from the transmission and distribution utilities or the
ercot iso and d the fact that as additional information becomes available the
impact of recognizing revised estimates in subsequent periods relating to a
previous period can be material to our retail energy segments and our
consolidated results of operations if our estimate of either electricity usage
volumes or estimated rates were to increase or decrease by 3 our accrued
unbilled revenues at december 31 2003 would have increased or decreased by
approximately 9 million a 3 increase or decrease in both our estimated
electricity usage and estimated rates would have increased or decreased our
accrued unbilled revenues at december 31 2003 by approximately 17 million

     estimated energy supply costs  we record energy supply costs for
electricity sales and services to retail customers based on estimated supply
volumes and an estimated rate per mwh for the applicable reporting period we
consider this accounting estimate to be a critical accounting estimate because
of a the uncertainty inherent in estimating both the supply volumes and the
rate per mwh and b the uncertainty related to the ercot iso settlement process
as discussed below and c the fact that as additional information becomes
available the impact of recognizing revised estimates in subsequent periods

                                        73

relating to a previous period can be material to our retail energy segments and
our consolidated results of operations

     in 2002 and 2003 a portion of our energy supply costs 61 million and 53
million respectively consisted of estimated transmission and distribution
charges not billed by the transmission and distribution utilities

     in estimating supply volumes we consider the effects of historical
customer volumes weather factors and usage by customer class we estimate our
transmission and distribution delivery fees using the same method that we use
for electricity sales and services to retail customers in addition we estimate
ercot iso fees based on historical trends estimated supply volumes and initial
ercot iso settlements volume estimates are then multiplied by the estimated
rate and recorded as purchased power expense in the applicable reporting period
if our estimate of electricity usage volumes increased or decreased by 3 our
energy supply costs would have increased or decreased by approximately 6
million changes in our volume usage would have resulted in a similar offsetting
change in billed volumes thus partially mitigating our energy supply costs

     changes in estimates  during 2003 we revised our estimates and
assumptions related to retail energy revenues and energy supply costs in 2002
the revisions resulted in the recognition in 2003 of 39 million of income as
additional information becomes available we may recognize additional income or
losses

     dependence on ercot iso settlement procedures  in texas our primary
retail energy market the ercot iso is responsible for scheduling and settling
all electricity volumes and related fees as part of settlement the ercot iso
communicates actual volumes compared to scheduled volumes the ercot iso
calculates an additional charge or credit by calculating the difference between
the actual and scheduled volumes multiplied by the marketclearing price for
balancing energy service the ercot iso also charges customerserving market
participants administrative fees reliability must run contract fees out of
merit energy fees and out of merit capacity fees the ercot iso allocates these
and other fees to market participants based on each market participants share
of the total load we may not know about these fees which are generally outside
of our control until the ercot iso bills them if the ercot isos records
indicate that our volumes delivered were greater than the volumes our records
indicate we may be billed a larger than expected share of these total fees

     preliminary settlement information is due from the ercot iso within two
months after electricity is delivered final settlement information is due from
the ercot iso within 12 months after electricity is delivered we record our
estimated supply costs and related fees using estimated supply volumes as
discussed above and adjust those costs upon receipt of the ercot iso
information delays in settlements could materially affect the accuracy of our
recorded energy supply costs and related fees

     the ercot iso volume settlement process has been delayed on several
occasions because of operational problems with data management among the ercot
iso the transmission and distribution utilities and the retail electric
providers during the third quarter of 2002 the ercot iso issued trueup
settlements for the pilot time period of july 2001 to december 2001 the ercot
iso then temporarily suspended trueup settlement calculations to allow a
threshold level of consumption data for subsequent periods from the transmission
and distribution utilities to be loaded into the ercot isos systems in 2003
the ercot iso prepared trueup settlement calculations for the period january
2002 through december 2002 the ercot iso has scheduled to resume trueup
settlement calculations for 2003 in april 2004

     these settlement calculations indicate that our customers utilized greater
volumes of electricity than our records indicated we have invoked the ercot
isos dispute resolution process for settlement calculations for the period from
january 2002 to date as of december 31 2003 the amount in dispute with the
ercot iso is 11 million due to differences in volumes partially offset by
unaccountedforenergy costs variances

  loss contingencies

     we record a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly
analyze current information and as necessary provide accruals for probable
liabilities on the eventual disposition of those matters that can be estimated
we consider these estimates to be critical accounting estimates because a they
entail significant judgment by us regarding probabilities and ranges of
exposure b the ultimate outcome of the proceedings relating to these
contingencies is unknown and c the ultimate outcome could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows
estimates of contingent losses affect all our reportable segments for a
discussion of these contingencies see note 15 to our consolidated financial
statements

  deferred tax assets valuation allowance and tax liabilities

     we estimate a income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we
operate b net deferred tax assets based on expected future taxable benefits
in such jurisdictions and c valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for
additional information regarding these estimates which affect all of our
reportable segments see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements we
consider these estimates to be a critical accounting estimate because a they
require estimates of projected future operating results which are inherently
imprecise and b they depend on assumptions regarding our ability to generate
future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are
deductible

     in addition we recognize contingent tax liabilities through tax expense
and tax expense for discontinued operations for estimated exposures related to
our current tax positions we evaluate the need for contingent tax liabilities
on a quarterly basis and any change in the amount will be recorded in our
results of operations as appropriate it could take several years to resolve
certain of these contingencies

item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about nontrading and trading
          activities and related market risks

market risk and risk management

     we are exposed to various market risks these risks arise from the
ownership of our assets and operation of our business most of the revenues
expenses results of operations and cash flows from our business activities are
impacted by market risks categories of significant market risks include
exposures primarily related to commodity prices and interest rates

     during the normal course of business we review our hedging strategies and
determine the hedging approach we deem appropriate based upon the circumstances
of each situation we frequently utilize derivative instruments to execute our
risk management and hedging strategies derivative instruments are instruments
such as futures forward contracts swaps or options that derive their value
from underlying assets indices reference rates or a combination of these
factors these derivative instruments include negotiated contracts which are
referred to as overthecounter derivatives and instruments that are listed and
traded on an exchange

     we primarily use derivative instruments to manage and hedge exposures such
as exposure to changes in electricity and fuel prices and interest rate risk on
our floatingrate borrowings we believe that the associated market risk of
these instruments can best be understood relative to the underlying assets or
risk being hedged and our hedging strategy

     during 2002 we evaluated our trading marketing power origination and
risk management services strategies and activities during the second half of
2002 we began to reduce our wholesale energy segments trading in march 2003
we discontinued our proprietary trading business trading positions taken prior
to our decision to exit this business are managed solely for purposes of closing
them on economical terms

     we have a risk control framework designed to monitor measure and define
appropriate transactions to hedge and manage the risk in our existing portfolio
of assets and contracts and to authorize new transactions these risks fall into
three different categories market risk credit risk and operational risk we
believe that we have effective procedures for evaluating and managing these
risks to which we are exposed key risk control activities include definition of
appropriate transactions for hedging credit review and approval credit and
performance risk measurement and monitoring validation of transactions
portfolio valuation and daily portfolio reporting including marktomarket
valuation valueatrisk and other risk measurement metrics we seek to monitor
and control our risk exposures through a variety of separate but complementary
processes and committees which involve business unit management senior
management and our board of directors

     the effectiveness of our policies and procedures for managing risk exposure
can never be completely estimated or fully assured for example we could
experience losses which could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations financial condition or cash flows from unexpectedly large or rapid
movements or disruptions in the energy markets from regulatorydriven market
rule changes andor bankruptcy of customers or counterparties

     given our current credit and liquidity situation and other factors we have
reduced our hedging activities which could result in greater volatility in
future earnings additionally the reduction in market liquidity may impair the
effectiveness of our risk management procedures and hedging strategies these
and other factors may adversely impact our results of operations financial
condition and cash flows

     see notes 2d and 7 to our consolidated financial statements for the
accounting for these types of transactions

nontrading market risk

     commodity price risk  commodity price risk is an inherent component of
wholesale and retail electric businesses prior to the energy delivery period
we attempt to hedge in part the economics of our

wholesale and retail electric businesses derivative instruments are used to
mitigate exposure to variability in future cash flows from probable anticipated
future transactions attributable to a commodity risk

1 represents our nymex futures positions in natural gas and crude oil nymex
    has quoted prices for natural gas and crude oil for the next 72 and 30
    months respectively

2 represents our forward positions in natural gas and power at points for
    which otc broker quotes are available which on average extend 36 and 24
    months into the future respectively positions are valued against
    internally developed forward market price curves that are frequently
    validated and recalibrated against otc broker quotes this category also
    includes some transactions whose prices are obtained from external sources
    and then modeled to hourly daily or monthly prices as appropriate

3 represents the value of a our valuation adjustments for liquidity credit
    and administrative costs b options or structured transactions not quoted
    by an exchange or otc broker but for which the prices of the underlying are
    available and c transactions for which an internally developed price curve
    was constructed as a result of the longdated nature of the transaction or
    the illiquidity of the market point

     the fair values in the above table are subject to significant changes based
on fluctuating market prices and conditions changes in our derivative assets
and liabilities result primarily from changes in the valuation of the portfolio
of contracts and the timing of settlements the most significant parameters
impacting the value of our portfolios of contracts include natural gas and power
forward market prices volatility and credit risk market prices assume a normal
functioning market with an adequate number of buyers and sellers providing
market liquidity insufficient market liquidity could significantly affect the
values that could be obtained for these contracts as well as the costs at which
these contracts could be hedged

     we assess the risk of our nontrading derivatives using a sensitivity
analysis method derivative instruments which we use as economic hedges create
exposure to commodity prices which in turn offset the commodity exposure
inherent in our businesses the standalone commodity risk created by these
instruments without regard to the offsetting effect of the underlying exposure
these instruments are intended to hedge is described below the sensitivity
analysis performed on our nontrading energy derivatives measures the potential
loss in fair value based on a hypothetical 10 movement in the underlying energy
prices a decrease of 10 in the market prices of energy commodities from their
december 31 2003 levels would have decreased the fair value of our nontrading
energy derivatives by 70 million of this amount 63 million relates to a loss
in fair value of our nontrading derivatives that are designated as cash flow
hedges and 7 million relates to a loss in earnings of our economic hedges a
decrease of 10 in the market prices of energy commodities from their december
31 2002 levels would have decreased the fair value of our nontrading energy
derivatives by 38 million

     the above analysis of the nontrading energy derivatives utilized for
hedging purposes does not include the favorable impact that the same
hypothetical price movement would have on our physical purchases and sales of
natural gas and electric power to which the hedges relate furthermore the non
trading energy derivative portfolio is managed to complement our asset
portfolio thereby reducing overall risks therefore the adverse impact to the
fair value of the portfolio of nontrading energy derivatives held

                                        77
page

for hedging purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity
prices referenced above would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying
hedged physical transactions assuming

      the nontrading energy derivatives are not closed out in advance of their
       expected term

      the nontrading energy derivatives continue to function effectively as
       hedges of the underlying risk

     and

      as applicable anticipated underlying transactions settle as expected

     if any of the abovementioned assumptions cease to be true a loss on the
derivative instruments may occur or the options might be worthless as
determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date
whichever comes first nontrading energy derivatives which qualify as cash
flow hedges and which are effective as hedges may still have some percentage
that is not effective the change in value of the nontrading energy
derivatives which represents the ineffective component of the cash flow hedges
is recorded in our results of operations during 2001 2002 and 2003 we
recognized a gain of 28 million a loss of 17 million and a loss of 20
million respectively in our results of operations due to hedge
ineffectiveness

     interest rate risk  we have issued longterm debt and have obligations
under bank facilities that subject us to the risk of loss associated with
movements in market interest rates in addition we have entered into interest
rate swap and interest rate cap agreements to mitigate our exposure to interest
rate fluctuations associated with certain of our variable rate debt instruments
we assess interest rate risks using a sensitivity analysis method the table
below provides information concerning our financial instruments as of december
31 2002 and 2003 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates

a transactions establishing open positions in the energy markets primarily on
a shortterm basis and b energy price risk management services to customers
primarily related to natural gas electric power and other energyrelated
commodities we provided these services by utilizing a variety of derivative
instruments we accounted for these transactions under marktomarket accounting
and continue to account for the remaining legacy positions under marktomarket
accounting our electricity sales to large commercial industrial and

     fair value of new contracts  general  the fair value of retail energy
segment electric sales contracts with large commercial industrial and
institutional customers was determined by comparing the contract price to an
estimate of the market cost of delivered retail energy and applying the
estimated volumes under the provisions of these contracts the calculation of
the estimated cost of energy involves estimating the customers anticipated load
volume and using forward ercot otc commodity prices adjusted for the
customers anticipated load characteristics the delivery costs were estimated
at the time sales contracts were executed these costs were based on published
rates and our experience of actual delivery costs the fair values of these
energy supply contracts were estimated using ercot otc forward price and
volatility curves and correlations among power and fuel prices specific to the
ercot region net of credit risk the fair values of new wholesale energy
contracts at inception are estimated using otc forward price and volatility
curves and correlation among power and fuel prices net of estimated credit
risk

     fair value of new contracts  2002  during 2002 our retail energy
segment entered into electric sales contracts with large commercial industrial
and institutional customers ranging from onehalf to four years in duration
during 2002 we recognized total fair value of 43 million for these contracts
at the inception dates we entered into energy supply contracts to substantially
hedge the economics of these contracts these contracts had an aggregate fair
value of 8 million at the contract inception dates the remaining fair value of
contracts entered into during 2002 recorded at inception of 6 million primarily
relates to natural gas transportation contracts entered into by our wholesale
energy segment

     changes in fair values attributable to changes in valuation techniques and
assumptions  2002 during 2002 the following changes in valuation techniques
and assumptions were made

      we changed our methodology for allocating credit reserves between our
       trading and nontrading portfolios total credit reserves calculated for
       both the trading and nontrading portfolios which are less than the sum
       of the independently calculated credit reserves for each portfolio due to
       common counterparties between the portfolios are allocated to the
       trading and nontrading portfolios based upon the independently
       calculated trading and nontrading credit reserves previously credit
       reserves were independently calculated for the trading portfolio while
       credit reserves for the nontrading portfolio were calculated by
       deducting the trading credit reserves from the total credit reserves
       calculated for both portfolios this change in methodology reduced credit
       reserves relating to the trading portfolio by 18 million

      our retail energy segment eliminated a valuation factor for potential
       claims for delays in switching under the liquidated damages clauses in
       contracts we eliminated this valuation factor because there was adequate
       data to substantiate that these claims would not be submitted this
       change in methodology reduced credit reserves by 5 million

      our retail energy segment added a valuation factor adjustment to capture
       the potential earnings loss associated with customers terminating
       contracts due to a provision in some of its contracts that allows
       customers to terminate their contracts if our unsecured debt ratings fall
       below investment grade or if our ratings are withdrawn entirely by a
       rating agency during 2002 each of the major rating agencies downgraded
       our credit ratings to subinvestment grade we performed an analysis at
       the customer level to estimate our exposure for these provisions this
       change in methodology increased credit reserves by 1 million

      our retail energy segment changed the methodology related to recording
       its estimate of unaccountedforenergy our retail energy segment changed
       its unaccountedforenergy factor from 16 to zero the reason for the
       change is that we believed the unaccountedforenergy factor was
       effectively included in the volatility valuation factor and our results
       from energy sales in 2001 were not negatively impacted by
       unaccountedforenergy this change in methodology increased the fair
       value of the net trading assets by 9 million

     changes in fair values attributable to changes in valuation techniques and
assumptions  2003 during 2003 the following changes in valuation techniques
and assumptions were made

      we modified our estimated probabilities of counterparty default and
       considered master netting agreements which resulted in a decrease in
       credit reserves of 10 million

      we reduced estimated costs to administer transactions used in calculating
       administrative reserves to reflect the change in our cost structure
       which resulted in a decrease in administrative reserves of 2 million

      we modified our assumptions for liquidity reserves to consider the
       widening of bidask spreads for transactions occurring further into the
       future which resulted in an increase in the liquidity reserves of 5
       million

      we adjusted our discount rate used in valuing derivative transactions to
       a riskfree united states treasury rate from an investmentgrade utility
       rate which resulted in an increase in fair value of 4 million

     we employ a risk management system to mitigate the risks associated with
our legacy trading activities these activities involve market risk associated
with managing these energy commodities historically our trading activities
depended on price and volatility changes to create business opportunities but
within authorized limits

     we primarily assess the risk of our legacy trading positions using a
valueatrisk method in order to maintain our total exposure within authorized
limits valueatrisk is the potential loss in value of trading

                                        81
page

positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time period within a
specified confidence level we utilize the parametric variancecovariance method
with deltagamma approximation to calculate valueatrisk

     our valueatrisk limits are set by the audit committee of our board of
directors risk limits for our legacy trading activities include both
valueatrisk as well as other nonstatistical measures of portfolio exposure
the risk management process supplements the measurement and enforcement of the
limit metrics with additional analyses including stress testing the portfolio
for extreme events and backtesting the valueatrisk model

     our valueatrisk model utilizes four major parameters confidence level
volatility correlation and holding period

      confidence level natural gas and petroleum products have a confidence
       interval of 95 and power products have a confidence interval of 99 the
       confidence level for power products is higher in order to capture the
       nonnormality of power price behavior

      volatility calculated daily from historical forward prices using the
       exponentially weighted moving average method

      correlation calculated daily from daily volatilities and historical
       forward prices using the exponentially weighted moving average method
       this parameter is included to account for the diversification of the
       portfolio

      holding period natural gas and petroleum products generally have one day
       holding periods for 2002 and two day holding periods for 2003 power
       products have holding periods of 1 to 20 days for 2002 and 5 to 20 days
       for 2003 based on the risk profile of the portfolio the holding periods
       for power products reflect our efforts to appropriately account for
       possible liquidation periods of more than one or five days as
       applicable which is reasonable for some nonstandard products the
       change in assumptions for the holding periods for natural gas and
       petroleum products and power products in 2003 did not have a material
       impact on the valueatrisk calculation

     assuming a confidence level of 95 and a oneday holding period if
valueatrisk is calculated at 10 million we may state that there is a one in
20 chance that if prices move against our consolidated diversified positions
our pretax loss in liquidating or offsetting with hedges our applicable
portfolio in a oneday period would exceed 10 million

     while we believe that our assumptions and approximations are reasonable for
calculating valueatrisk there is no uniform industry methodology for
estimating valueatrisk and different assumptions andor approximations could
produce materially different valueatrisk estimates

     an inherent limitation of valueatrisk is that past market risk may not
produce accurate predictions of future market risk moreover valueatrisk
calculated for a specified holding period does not fully capture the market risk
of positions that cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within that
specified period future transactions market volatility reduction of market
liquidity failure of counterparties to satisfy their contractual obligations
andor a failure of risk controls could result in material losses from our
legacy trading activities

     the following table presents the daily valueatrisk for substantially all
of our legacy trading positions for our continuing operations for 2002 and 2003

     during 2003 average valueatrisk exposure was lower compared to 2002 due
to certain power trading activities in ercot related to our retail energy
segment no longer being accounted for on a marktomarket method of accounting
see note 2d to our consolidated financial statements lower overall trading
volumes during 2003 due to discontinuing proprietary trading activities also
contributed to a reduction in valueatrisk there was a shortterm increase in
valueatrisk during february 2003 due to volatility in the natural gas market
as a result and prior to exiting proprietary trading activities we realized a
trading loss related to certain of our natural gas trading positions of
approximately 80 million pretax in the first quarter of 2003

credit risk

contractual obligations by a counterparty credit risk is inherent in our

competition

the computer software market is intensely competitive and is subject to rapid
changes in technology it is influenced by the strategic direction of major
computer hardware manufacturers isps application service providers or asps
key application software vendors and operating system providers our
competitiveness depends on our ability to deliver products that meet our
customers needs by enhancing our existing solutions and offering reliable
scalable and standardized new solutions on a timely basis we have limited
resources and as a result we must deploy resources thoughtfully the principal
competitive factors in our consumer products and enterprise security and
administration segments are quality employment of the most advanced technology
time to market price reputation breadth of product offerings customer
support brand recognition and sales and marketing teams in our services
segment the principal competitive factors include technical capability
customer responsiveness price ability to attract and retain talented and
experienced personnel and reputation within the industry

competition in the consumer products market is intense some of the companies
that offer competing products to our consumer products offerings include
fsecure internet security services or iss mcafeecom network associates
norman panda secure computing sophos and zonelabs with the recent outbreaks
of viruses and other internetbased security threats several other companies
have entered the market and may become significant competitors in the future

in the enterprise security and administration market we compete against several
companies who offer competing products to our technology solutions
firewallsvpn intrusion detection vulnerability management web access
management and virus protection and support some of the companies that we
compete against are bindview checkpoint cisco computer associates iss
netopia network associates norman nortel panda pentasafe powerquest stac
software sonicwall traveling software trend micro and websense

price competition is intense with most of our products we expect price
competition to continue to increase and become even more significant in the
future which may reduce our profit margins

we also face competition from a number of other products that offer levels of
functionality different from those offered by our products or that were
designed for a somewhat different group of endusers than those targeted by us
operating system vendors such as microsoft have added features to new versions
of their products that provide some of the same functions offered in our
products microsoft has incorporated advanced utilities in windows 95 windows
98 windows 2000 windows millennium edition and windows xp and we believe
this trend will continue in addition several other operating systems are
gaining market acceptance such as red hat linux solaris and unixbased
operating systems and they may also incorporate advanced utilities or other
functionality offered in our products while we plan to continue to improve our
products with a view toward providing enhanced functionality over that provided
in current and future operating systems these efforts may be unsuccessful and
any improved products may not be commercially accepted by users we will also
continue to attempt to cooperate with operating system vendors to make our
products compatible with those operating systems while at the same time
differentiating our utility products from features included in these operating
systems our efforts in this regard may be unsuccessful

the demand for some of our products including those currently under
development may decrease if among other reasons

        microsoft includes additional product features in future releases of
         windows

        hardware vendors incorporate additional serverbased network management
         and security tools into network operating systems or

        competitors license certain of their products to microsoft or original
         equipment manufacturers for inclusion in their operating systems or
         products

in addition we compete with other computer software companies for access to
retail distribution channels and for the attention of customers at the retail
level and in corporate accounts we also compete with other software companies
to acquire products or companies and to publish software developed by third
parties

many of our existing and potential competitors may have greater financial
marketing or technological resources than we do we believe that competition in
the industry will continue to intensify as most major software companies expand
their product lines into additional product categories

manufacturing

our product development groups produce a set of master cdroms or diskettes and
documentation for each product that are then duplicated or replicated and
packaged into products by our logistics organization all of our domestic
manufacturing and order fulfillment is performed by an outside contractor under
the supervision of our domestic logistics organization purchasing of all raw
materials is done by symantec personnel in our cupertino california facility
and dublin ireland facility for products manufactured in those countries the
manufacturing steps that are subcontracted to outside organizations include the
duplication of diskettes and replication of cdroms printing of documentation
materials and retail boxes and assembly of the final packages we perform
diskette duplication assembly of the final packages and order fulfillment in
our dublin ireland manufacturing facility for most products distributed outside
of north and south america

intellectual property

we regard our software as proprietary we attempt to protect our software
technology by relying on a combination of copyright patent trade secret and
trademark laws restrictions on disclosure and other methods litigation may be
necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect trade secrets
or trademarks or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights
of others furthermore other parties have asserted and may in the future
assert infringement claims against us for further discussion on our current
litigation see note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements of this
form 10k these claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our
proprietary rights litigation even if not meritorious could result in
substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention

employees

as of march 31 2001 we employed approximately 3800 people worldwide
including approximately 1950 in sales marketing and related staff activities
950 in product development 100 in consulting services and 800 in management
manufacturing administration and finance none of our employees are represented
by a labor union and we have experienced no work stoppages we believe that
relations with our employees are good competition in recruiting personnel in
the software industry is intense we believe that our future success will depend
in part on our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled management
marketing and technical personnel we believe that we must provide personnel
with a competitive compensation package which necessitates the continued
availability of stock options and shares to be issued under our employee stock
option and purchase plans

 percentage change is not meaningful

net revenues

net revenues increased 14 from 746 million in fiscal 2000 to 854 million in
fiscal 2001 net revenues increased 26 from 593 million in fiscal 1999 to 746
million in fiscal 2000 the increase in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000
and the increase in fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999 were largely due to
increased sales to our enterprise customers introductions of new products and
increased sales outside of north america during the december 2000 quarter we
acquired axent which contributed approximately 42 million to our total net
revenues for fiscal 2001

consumer products

our consumer products segment represented approximately 39 43 and 45 of
total net revenues for fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively although net
revenues for this segment decreased as a percentage of net revenues net
revenues in absolute dollars increased in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal
2000 despite the slowdown in the personal computer sales environment the
absolute dollars increased primarily due to the increase in customer focus on
protecting their home computers from internet related attacks this factor
contributed to growth in sales of our norton internet security product which
was introduced in the march 2000 quarter




                                       15
page   18
net revenues in absolute dollars increased in the consumer products segment in
fiscal 2000 over fiscal 1999 this increase was primarily due to increased sales
of our antivirus products following outbreaks of significant viruses new
releases of both new and existing products and our customers preparing for the
year 2000 rollover these factors contributed to growth in sales of norton
antivirus norton systemworks and norton 2000 we have since discontinued our
norton 2000 product

during fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 the financial impact of product price
reductions for certain of our products was offset by the increase in the volume
of products sold

enterprise security and administration

our enterprise security and administration segments represented approximately
60 51 and 44 of total net revenues for fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999
respectively net revenues increased in fiscal 2001 as compared to 2000 due to
the continued strength of our virus protection solution growth from our
vulnerability management and intrusion detection solutions as a result of the
axent acquisition and the new release of our ghost corporate edition product

net revenues increased in fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999 primarily due
to strong demand for our enterprise administration products ghost corporate
edition and pcanywhere and increases due to virus outbreaks and year 2000
preparation

services and other

our services and other segments represented approximately 1 6 and 11 of
total net revenues for fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively the decrease in
fiscal 2001 and 2000 is due to our divestiture of the visual cafe and act
product lines in december 1999 which is included in the other segment

international

net revenues outside of north america represented 45 41 and 37 of total net
revenues for fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively international net
revenues increased by 74 million in fiscal 2001 to 382 million from 308
million in 2000 this increase in net revenues was the result of increased sales
in europe and japan net revenues from sales outside of north america increased
by 89 million in fiscal 2000 to 308 million from 219 million in fiscal 1999
this increase was also largely due to stronger sales in europe and japan

weaknesses in currencies fixed to the euro during fiscal 2001 slightly offset
by strengths in other currencies negatively impacted our international revenue
growth by approximately 44 million the impact in fiscal 2000 was approximately
15 million

product returns

we estimate and maintain reserves for product returns product returns
principally relate to stock balancing and the replacement of obsolete products
which are offset by orders of equal or greater value for the current versions of
the products the mix of products returned from our distributorsresellers as
compared to products sold to our



                                       16
page   19
distributorsresellers does not impact our gross margin as our gross margin is
materially consistent across our various product families changes in the level
of product returns and related product returns provision are generally offset by
a change in the level of gross revenue as a result the product returns
provision did not have a material impact on reported net revenues in any period
presented

gross margin

gross margin represents net revenues less cost of revenues cost of revenues
consists primarily of manufacturing expenses costs for producing manuals
packaging costs royalties paid to third parties under publishing contracts and
amortization and writeoff of acquired product rights gross margin was 85 of
net revenues in fiscal 2001 and 84 of net revenues in fiscal 2000 and 1999 the
improvement in gross margin in fiscal 2001 was primarily due to higher margins
associated with the increase in enterprise related sales and cost savings
achieved in reduced packaging costs

acquired product rights

as indicated in the overview during fiscal 2001 we acquired axent and recorded
approximately 86 million in acquired product rights during fiscal 2000 we
acquired urlabs l3 network securitys operations and 2020 software and
recorded approximately 11 million in acquired product rights amortization of
these intangibles which are included in cost of revenues totaled approximately
17 million 10 million and 6 million in fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999
respectively the amortization of intangible assets from our fiscal 2001 and
2000 acquisitions will occur over the next 5 years

research and development expenses

we charge research and development expenditures to operations as incurred as a
percentage of net revenues research and development expenses remained flat at
15 for fiscal 2001 and 2000 and were 17 for fiscal 1999 the overall growth in
our net revenues was the primary reason for the decrease in research and
development expenses as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal 2000 as compared
to fiscal 1999

although research and development expenses remained flat as a percentage of net
revenues absolute dollars increased 17 to approximately 127 million in fiscal
2001 from 108 million in fiscal 2000 the increase was a result of enterprise
security segment hiring salary increases and other employee related expenses
and axent related research and development expenses which were included from the
date of acquisition this increase was partially offset by the lack of expenses
in fiscal 2001 associated with the divested visual cafe and act product lines
and the patent claim settlements in the consumer products segment

research and development expenses increased 7 to approximately 108 million in
fiscal 2000 from 102 million in fiscal 1999 the increase was a result of
increases in software development costs paid to additional contractors employee
related expenses and additional costs for settlements related to disputes over
technology rights in fiscal 2000 offset by a reduction of research and
development expenses resulting from our divestitures

sales and marketing expenses

sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained flat at
41 for fiscal 2001 and 2000 and was 48 for fiscal 1999

sales and marketing expenses were approximately 350 million 307 million and
286 million in fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively the absolute dollar
increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal
2000 was primarily related to enterprise security segment hiring and increase in
salaries commissions and other performance based compensation and axent related
sales and marketing expenses which were included from the date of acquisition
the absolute dollar increase in sales and marketing dollars for fiscal 2000 over
fiscal 1999 was also due to increased headcount related salaries commission
and other performance based compensation

general and administrative expenses

general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 5 in
fiscal 2001 and 6 in fiscal 2000 and 1999

general and administrative expenses were approximately 45 million 42 million
and 36 million in fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively the absolute dollar
increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2001 as compared to
fiscal 2000 was primarily due to an increase in salary related expenses and
other general administrative expenses offset by a reduction in bad debt
expenses general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars increased in

2000 as compared to fiscal 1999 primarily due to increases in salaries and
benefits legal fees and bad debt expenses offset by reductions in certain
consulting expenses incurred in fiscal 1999

amortization of goodwill

amortization of goodwill increased 299 to approximately 71 million in fiscal
2001 from 18 million in fiscal 2000 the increase was related to amortization
of goodwill associated with the acquisition of axent in fiscal 2001
amortization of goodwill increased 190 to approximately 18 million in fiscal
2000 from 6 million in fiscal 1999 the increase was related to the
amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisitions of urlabs l3 network
securitys operations and 2020 software in fiscal 2000

acquired inprocess research and development expenses

in fiscal 2001 we acquired axent in fiscal 2000 we acquired urlabs and l3
network securitys operations in fiscal 1999 we acquired ibms and intels
antivirus businesses binary researchs operations and quarterdeck

we wrote off approximately 22 million 4 million and 27 million of acquired
inprocess research and development associated with these acquisitions in fiscal
2001 2000 and 1999 respectively these writeoffs were necessary because the
acquired technologies had not yet reached technological feasibility and there
were no alternative uses

the efforts required to develop the acquired inprocess technology principally
relate to the completion of all planning design development and testing
activities that are necessary to establish that the product or service can be
produced to meet its design specifications including features functions and
performance we expect the acquired inprocess technology to be developed into
commercially feasible products however there are no assurances that this will
occur if we fail to complete these products in their entirety or in a timely
manner we may not continue to attract new users we may be unable to retain our
existing users and the value of the other intangible assets may become impaired

we determined the fair value of the acquired inprocess technology for each of
the purchases by estimating the projected cash flows related to these projects
including the cost to complete the acquired inprocess technologies and future
revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products we discounted the
resulting cash flows back to their net present values we based the net cash
flows from such projects on our analysis of the respective markets and estimates
of revenues and operating profits related to these projects

a valuation specialist used our estimates to establish the amount of acquired
inprocess research and development to be written off for these acquisitions in
fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 as a result we wrote off 22 million in connection
with our acquisition of axent in fiscal 2001 using the following analysis

axent

the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements of certain aspects
of our expected future operating results from the operations of axent actual
results may differ from the estimates expressly or implicitly referred to by
these forwardlooking statements factors that may cause such differences
include those identified in the business risk factors set forth in this item 7

we are using the acquired inprocess research and development associated with
axent to create additional opportunities in internet security primarily in the
assessment and management of securing networks for enterprises

the inprocess technology acquired in the axent acquisition consisted primarily
of research and development related to the next generation of esm intruder
alert raptor firewall webthority and other projects axents research and
development was focused on providing more robust features in its development of
these next generation products

we assumed that revenue attributable to axents inprocess technologies would be
approximately 43 million in the first year and increase in the second and third
years of the fiveyear projection period at annual rates of 59 and 2
respectively and then decrease at rates of 16 and 37 over the remaining two
years we projected annual revenues to range between approximately 37 million
and 70 million over the projected period these projections were based on

               aggregate growth rates for the business as a whole

               individual product revenues

               anticipated product development cycles and

               the life of the underlying technology





                                       18
page   21
we estimated selling general and administrative expenses for the inprocess
technology to be 45 of revenue in each year of the fiveyear projection period

we projected operating results before acquisition related amortization charges
to range from an 8 million profit during the first year to an 18 million
profit during each of the second and third years we projected that the
operating profits would then decrease 16 in the fourth year and 38 in the
fifth year resulting in profits of approximately 15 million and 9 million
respectively

we estimated costs to be incurred to reach technological feasibility of the
inprocess technologies from axent as of the date of the acquisition to total
approximately 47 million we estimated the inprocess technology to be between
40 and 60 complete at that time

we used a discount rate of 25 for valuing the inprocess technologies from
axent which we believe reflects the risk associated with the completion of
these research and development projects and the estimated future economic
benefits to be generated subsequent to their completion this discount rate is
higher than the weighted average cost of capital of 15 due to the risks
related to the fact that the technology had not reached technological
feasibility as of the date of the valuation

the assumptions and projections discussed for the technologies acquired from
axent were based on information available at the time and should not be taken as
indications of actual results which could vary materially based on the risks
and uncertainties identified in the business risk factors set forth in this item

networks security have not significantly changed

urlabs

the inprocess technology acquired in the urlabs purchase consisted primarily of
research and development related to the next generation of urlabs two main
products igear and mailgear which have been added to our product offerings
the original assumptions and projections discussed in prior filings for the
research and development acquired from urlabs have not significantly changed

ibm

the inprocess technology acquired in the ibm purchase primarily consisted of
the ibm immune system technology and related antivirus patents we have
integrated this technology into our antivirus products the original
assumptions and projections discussed in prior filings for the immune system and
related antivirus technology acquired from ibm have not significantly changed

binary research

the inprocess technology acquired in the binary research acquisition primarily

assumptions and projections discussed in prior filings for the disk cloning
technologies acquired from binary research have not significantly changed

intel

the inprocess technology acquired in the intel purchase consisted of the
landesk antivirus technology which resides in the landesk virus protect
product line this technology has been integrated into our corporate antivirus
offerings the assumptions and projections discussed in prior filings for the
landesk antivirus technology acquired from intel have not significantly
changed

quarterdeck

the inprocess technology acquired in our acquisition of quarterdeck consisted
of projects related to quarterdecks cleansweep product line these technologies
have been integrated into norton systemworks and are sold as a standalone
product the assumptions and projections discussed in prior filings for the
projects related to quarterdecks cleansweep product line have not significantly
changed

restructuring and other expenses

during the march 2001 quarter we reorganized various operating functions
thereby reducing our workforce by 50 employees and recorded approximately 11
million for the costs of severance related benefits and outplacement services
in addition we provided approximately 12 million for costs of severance and
related benefits for six members of our senior management due to a realignment
of certain responsibilities

during the december 2000 quarter we reduced a portion of our operations in
toronto thereby reducing our workforce by 10 employees and recorded
approximately 04 million for the costs of severance related benefits and
abandonment of certain equipment in addition approximately 09 million was
provided for costs of severance and related benefits for four members of our
senior management due to a realignment of certain responsibilities

during the march 2000 quarter we reduced our operations in our melville and
toronto sites thereby reducing our workforce by 96 employees as a result we
vacated the facility in melville and we reduced the space occupied in toronto
we recorded approximately 34 million for employee severance outplacement and
abandonment of certain facilities and equipment during the march 2000 quarter
in addition we provided approximately 07 million for costs of severance
related benefits and outplacement services for two members of senior management
due to the realignment of our business units and their resulting departures
during the march 2000 quarter

during the december 1999 quarter we reduced our internet tools business units
workforce and reduced our sales workforce there were 48 employees in the
internet tools business unit affected resulting in a charge of approximately
18 million for severance related benefits and outplacement services the
sales workforce reduction affected 10 employees resulting in a charge of
approximately 04 million for severance related benefits and outplacement
services

during the september 1999 quarter we provided approximately 07 million for
costs of severance related benefits and outplacement services for two members
of senior management due to the realignment of our business units and their
resulting departures we also recorded approximately 27 million for certain
costs related to an agreement reached with our former ceo in the june 1999
quarter these costs were comprised of severance and the acceleration of
unvested stock options

during the september 1998 quarter we made a decision to restructure our
operations and outsource domestic manufacturing operations as a result we
originally recorded a 38 million charge for personnel severance to reduce the
workforce by approximately 5 in both domestic and international operations and
a 13 million charge for the planned abandonment of a manufacturing facility
lease these estimates were subsequently revised in the september 1999 quarter
resulting in a reduction in the personnel severance and outplacement accruals by
approximately 07 million

litigation judgment

during the june 1998 quarter we accrued litigation expenses of approximately 6
million related to a judgment by a canadian court on a decadeold copyright
action assumed by us as a result of our acquisition of delrina corporation for
further discussion on our current litigation see note 15 of the notes to
consolidated financial statements of this form 10k

interest income interest expense and other income expense

interest income was approximately 33 million in 2001 and was relatively flat at
13 million in fiscal 2000 and 1999 interest income increased 148 in fiscal
2001 over fiscal 2000 the increase was primarily due to a higher average cash
balance during fiscal 2001 as compared to prior years

interest expense was approximately 2 million in fiscal 1999 the interest
expense in fiscal 1999 was principally related to our convertible subordinated
debentures which were converted into our common stock in february 1999 and for
interest on quarterdecks subordinated notes that were paid off in march 1999
interest expense was not significant in fiscal 2001 and 2000

other expense net was approximately 23 million in fiscal 2001 and consisted
primarily of net losses on our equity investments other income net was
approximately 1 million and 2 million in fiscal 2000 and 1999 respectively
and was primarily comprised of gains and losses from nonfunctional currency
exchange transactions for further

gain on divestiture of visual cafe

on december 31 1999 we sold the principal assets and liabilities of the visual
cafe product line to webgain inc or webgain the assets primarily consisted
of fixed assets and intangible assets the liabilities related to certain
revenue deferrals in exchange for the assets and liabilities sold to webgain
we received 750 million in a lumpsum cash payment on december 31 1999 we
wrote off or transferred approximately 47 million of capitalized software
fixed assets and inventory related to the visual cafe product line in addition
we accrued approximately 14 million in transaction costs and 04 million in
retention packages for the affected employees as a result we recorded a
pretax gain of approximately 685 million on the divestiture

gain on divestiture of act and royalties from interact

on december 31 1999 we licensed substantially all of the act product line
technology on an exclusive basis to interact commerce corporation previously
saleslogix corporation or interact for a period of four years in addition we
sold the inventory and fixed assets related to the act product line to
interact in consideration for the license and assets interact transferred to
us 623247 shares of its unregistered common stock these shares were valued at
approximately 20 million as of december 6 1999 the date the license was
signed and the date the number of shares was determined as a result of the
license we recognized approximately 20 million of income from the shares
received which was offset by approximately 04 million of inventory and fixed
assets attributed to the act product line that was written off and transferred
to interact in addition we accrued approximately 13 million for transaction
related costs incurred at december 31 1999 after recognizing the above
amounts we recorded a pretax gain of approximately 183 million during the
march 2001 quarter interact entered into a plan to merge with the sage group
plc and we recorded a loss of approximately 125 million as other expense
related to the other than temporary decline in value of our investment in
interact for further discussion on our investment in interact see note 5 of
notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k

in addition to the shares received from interact interact is required to pay us
quarterly royalty payments for four years interact will pay these royalties
based on future revenues up to an aggregate maximum of 57 million because the
royalties are not guaranteed and the quarterly amounts to be received are not
determinable until earned we are recognizing these royalties as payments are
due we recorded approximately 193 million and 5 million of royalty payments
in income net of expense from sale of technologies and product lines in fiscal
2001 and 2000 respectively

transition fees

in accordance with individual transition agreements webgain and interact paid
us fees for invoicing collecting receivables shipping and other operational
and support activities through fiscal 2001 until they had the ability to take
over these activities we recorded approximately 08 million and 09 million
for these fees during fiscal 2001 and 2000 respectively in income net of
expense from sale of technologies and product lines

payments from hp and jetform

payments from hp and jetform were associated with our sale of certain software
products technologies and tangible assets to the hewlettpackard company and
jetform corporation during fiscal 1997 the payments decreased from
approximately 15 million in fiscal 2000 to 04 million in fiscal 2001 these
payments also decreased from



                                       21
page   24
approximately 41 million in fiscal 1999 to 15 million in fiscal 2000 the
payments declined in fiscal 2001 and 2000 because the hp payments ended in the
december 1998 quarter and the payments from jetform ended in the june 2000
quarter

income taxes

our effective tax rate on income before onetime charges acquired inprocess
research and development restructuring and other expenses goodwill
amortization expense and gain on sale of product lines was 32 for fiscal 2001
2000 and 1999 our fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 effective rates were lower than
the us federal and state combined statutory rate primarily due to a lower
statutory tax rate on our irish operations

our effective tax rate on income was 55 34 and 40 for fiscal 2001 2000 and
1999 respectively the higher effective tax rate in fiscal 2001 reflects the
nondeductibility of acquired inprocess research and development and
substantially all of the goodwill amortization the higher effective tax rate in
fiscal 1999 reflects the nondeductibility of acquired inprocess research and
development in addition for fiscal 2000 tax was provided on the gain on sale
of product lines at an effective tax rate of 34 this rate is lower than the
us federal and state combined statutory rate because a portion of the gain is
attributable to our irish operations and accordingly subject to a lower irish
tax rate

realization of a significant portion of the 80 million of net deferred tax
assets is dependent on our ability to generate future us taxable income of
approximately 145 million

we believe that it is more likely than not that the 80 million of deferred tax
assets will be realized based on historical earnings and expected levels of
future us taxable income levels of future taxable income are subject to the
various risks and uncertainties discussed in the business risk factors set forth
in this item 7 additional valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets
may be necessary if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the net
deferred tax assets will not be realized we will assess the need for additional
valuation allowance on a quarterly basis

we project our effective tax rate on income before goodwill amortization to be
32 in fiscal 2002 this projection however is subject to change due to
potential tax law changes and fluctuations in the geographic allocation of
earnings


liquidity and capital resources

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased approximately 125
million to 557 million at the end of fiscal 2001 from 432 million at the end
of fiscal 2000 this increase was largely due to cash provided from operations
including royalty income from interact net proceeds from the exercise of stock
options under our stock option plans sales of common stock through our employee
stock purchase plan and acquired axent cash balances the cash provided by
these factors was partially offset by cash paid to repurchase common stock for
capital expenditures and for marketable securities and investments

in addition to cash and shortterm investments we have 75 million of
restricted investments related to collateral requirements under certain lease
agreements we are obligated under these lease agreements for two office
buildings in cupertino california to maintain a restricted cash balance
invested in us treasury securities with maturities not to exceed three years
in accordance with the lease terms these funds are not available to meet our
operating cash requirements this lease is classified as an operating lease we
were in compliance with our covenants on these lease agreements as of march 31
2001 future acquisitions or other events could cause us to be in violation of
these covenants

on march 30 2001 we entered into a master lease agreement for land and the
construction of two office buildings in newport news virginia effective june
6 2001 and eugene oregon effective april 6 2001 we are obligated under the
lease agreement to maintain a restricted cash balance invested in us treasury
securities with maturities not to exceed two years during the construction
period or in certificates of deposit issued by certain lenders after the
construction period in accordance with the lease terms these funds are not
available to meet our operating cash requirements as of march 31 2001 we had
no restricted funds associated with these facilities this lease is classified
as an operating lease in addition we are obligated to comply with certain
financial covenants future acquisitions or other events could cause us to be in
violation of these financial covenants

as of march 31 2001 we also had a 10 million line of credit that expired may
2001 we were in compliance with the debt covenants for this line of credit as
of march 31 2001 there were no borrowings and less than 1 million of


                                       22
page   25
standby letters of credit outstanding under this line as of march 31 2001
although we did not renew this line of credit we believe that there will not be
a material adverse impact on our financial results liquidity or capital
resources

net cash provided by operating activities was approximately 325 million and was
comprised of net income of approximately 64 million noncash related expenses
of 149 million and a net increase of 112 million in liabilities net of an
increase in assets

net trade accounts receivable increased 70 million to approximately 117
million at march 31 2001 from approximately 47 million at march 31 2000 the
increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the acquisition of axents
accounts receivable balances and increases in our enterprise security and
international sales

net cash provided by investing activities was approximately 24 million and was
comprised primarily of 60 million in net proceeds from sales of marketable
securities and investments and 37 million in acquired axent cash balances
offset by 73 million of capital expenditures and other investing activities

on march 22 1999 the board authorized the repurchase of up to 75 million of
our outstanding common stock on january 16 2001 the board replaced this
authorization with a new authorization to repurchase up to 700 million not to
exceed 15 million shares of symantec common stock with no expiration date
during fiscal 2001 we repurchased 50 million shares at prices ranging from
4607 to 5116 for an aggregate amount of approximately 244 million

we believe that existing cash and shortterm investments and cash generated from
operating results will be sufficient to fund operations for the next year

recent accounting pronouncements

on february 14 2001 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued
a limited revision of its september 7 1999 exposure draft business
combinations and intangible assets that proposes to significantly change the
accounting for goodwill acquired in a purchase business combination under the
revised proposal goodwill would not be amortized but would be reviewed for
impairment annually and if certain events occur or circumstances exist goodwill
impairment charges would be presented as a separate line item within the
operating section of the income statement the nonamortization approach would
apply to previously recorded goodwill as well as goodwill arising from
acquisitions completed after the application of the new standard amortization
of the remaining book value of goodwill would cease and the new impairmentonly
approach would apply the fasb expects to release the final statement in july
2001 we will not adopt the provisions of the proposed statement which defers
reporting the effects of the proposed statement until our first quarter of
fiscal 2003

in june 1998 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards or
sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities
which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts
collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities in june
1999 the fasb issued sfas no 137 accounting for derivative instruments and
hedging activities  deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 133
which defers the adoption of sfas no 133 for one year sfas 133 will be
effective for symantec at the beginning of the june 2001 quarter for both annual
and interim reporting periods we do not expect the adoption of this accounting
pronouncement to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position
or results of operations

business risk factors

the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve known
and unknown risks and uncertainties our actual results levels of activity
performance or achievements may be materially different from any future results
levels of activity performance or achievements expressed or implied by such
forwardlooking statements factors that may cause or contribute to this
difference include among others things those risk factors set forth in this
section and elsewhere in this report we identify forwardlooking statements by
words such as may will should could expects plans
anticipates believes estimates predicts potential or continue
or similar terms that refer to the future we cannot guarantee future results
levels of activity performance or achievements

we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions which give rise to
a number of risks that could have adverse consequences for our future operating
results we have made eight acquisitions within the last three fiscal years
with our acquisition of axent being the largest and most recent integrating
acquired businesses may distract our management focus from other opportunities
and challenges our past acquisitions have given rise to and future
acquisitions may result in substantial levels of goodwill and other intangible
assets that may be amortized or written off in future years in addition a
number of our recent acquisitions have resulted in our incurring substantial
writeoffs of acquired inprocess research and development costs and this also
may occur as a result of future acquisitions we may issue equity or incur debt
to finance future acquisitions that are dilutive to our existing stockholders

continued integration of axent may be difficult which may adversely affect
operations we have been in the process of integrating axent into our operations
since the date of acquisition this integration of axent with our business
however has been and will continue to be a complex timeconsuming and
expensive process and may disrupt our business if not accomplished in a timely
and efficient manner we must operate as a combined organization utilizing
common information and communications systems operating procedures financial
controls and human resources practices

we may still encounter substantial difficulties costs and delays involved in
integrating our operations including

               potential conflicts between business cultures

               perceived adverse changes in business focus

               potential conflicts in distribution marketing or other
                important relationships

               the loss of key employees andor

               the diversion of managements attention from other ongoing
                business concerns

further the market price of our common stock could decline if

               the integration of axent is unsuccessful

               we are unable to successfully market our products and services
                to axents customers or axents products and services to our
                customers

               we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the merger as
                rapidly as or to the extent anticipated by financial or
                industry analysts or such analysts do not perceive the same
                benefits to the merger as both axent and we do or

               the effect of the merger on our financial results is not
                consistent with the expectations of financial or industry
                analysts

our increased sales of enterprisewide site licenses may increase fluctuations
in our financial results sales of enterprisewide site licenses through our
enterprise security segment have been increasing and now represent a major
portion of our business this portion of our business could increase
significantly due to our recent acquisition of axent this enterprise market has
significantly different characteristics than the consumer market and different
skills and resources are needed to penetrate this market licensing arrangements
tend to involve a longer sales cycle than sales through other distribution
channels require greater investment of resources in establishing the enterprise
relationship and can sometimes result in lower operating margins the timing of
the execution of volume licenses or



                                       24

their nonrenewal or renegotiation by large customers could cause our results of
operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could have a
material adverse impact on our results of operations

we expect to make substantial changes to our information systems that could
disrupt our business the information systems that support our accounting
finance order management and manufacturing systems are based on oracle 107
and many of the business applications used in other aspects of our business have
been tightly coupled with oracle 107 oracle has released a new version 11i
and has announced that support for 107 will be discontinued at the end of 2001
in addition as our business has grown we have developed needs for an
increasingly robust customer relationship management or crm system during
fiscal 2002 we will be implementing oracle 11i and a new crm system these
types of transitions frequently prove disruptive to the underlying business of
an enterprise and may cause us to incur higher costs than we anticipate failure
to manage a smooth transition to the new systems could result in a material
adverse effect on our business operations

our software products and web site may be subject to intentional disruption
although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional
disruptions such as software viruses specifically designed to impede the
performance of our products we expect to be an ongoing target of such
disruptions similarly experienced computer programmers or hackers may
attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our web site and
misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services
our activities could be substantially disrupted and our reputation and future
sales harmed if these efforts are successful

our markets are highly competitive and our operating results and financial
condition could be adversely affected by this competition our markets are
intensely competitive this competition could adversely affect our operating
results by reducing our sales or the prices we can charge for our products our
ability to remain competitive depends in part on our ability to enhance our
products or develop new products that are compatible with new hardware and
operating systems we have no control over and limited insight into
development efforts by third parties with respect to new hardware and operating
systems and we may not be able to respond effectively or timely to such changes
in the market in addition we have limited resources and we must make strategic
decisions as to the best allocation of our resources to position ourselves for
changes in our markets we may from time to time allocate resources to projects
or markets that do not develop as rapidly or fully as we expect we may fail to
allocate resources to third party products or to markets that are more
successful than we anticipate

introduction of new operating systems may adversely affect our financial results
and stock price the inclusion of security or virus protection tools in new
operating systems and hardware packages could adversely affect our sales for
example the inclusion of features by microsoft in new or upcoming versions of
windows such as windows xp which directly compete with our products may
decrease or delay the demand for certain of our products including those
currently under development and products specifically intended for windows xp
our financial results and our stock price declined significantly following the
releases of windows 31 windows 95 and windows 98 the release of future
editions of windows including windows xp in our december 2001 quarter could
adversely affect our financial results and stock price additionally as
hardware vendors incorporate additional serverbased network management and
security tools into network operating systems the demand may decrease for some
of our products including those currently under development

our earnings and stock price are subject to significant fluctuations due to
many factors including those noted in this section our earnings and stock
price have been and may continue to be subject to significant volatility there
have been previous quarters in which we have experienced shortfalls in revenue
and earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and investors which
have had an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our
common stock this may occur again in the future

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results have affected our stock price in
the past and could affect our stock price in the future if our quarterly
operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors the
trading price of shares of our common stock could be negatively affected our
quarterly operating results have varied substantially in the past and may vary
substantially in the future depending upon a number of factors including

               the timing of announcements and releases of new or enhanced
                versions of our products and product upgrades

               the introduction of competitive products by existing or new
                competitors

               reduced demand for any given product

               seasonality in the endofperiod buying patterns of foreign and
                domestic software markets and

               the markets transition between new releases of operating
                systems



                                       25
page   28
in addition to the foregoing factors the risk of quarterly fluctuations is
increased by the fact that a significant portion of our net revenues has
historically been generated during the last month of each fiscal quarter most
resellers tend to make a majority of their purchases at the end of a fiscal
quarter in addition many enterprise customers negotiate site licenses near the
end of each quarter in part this is because these two groups are able or
believe that they are able to negotiate lower prices and more favorable terms
at that time our reliance on a large portion of revenue occurring at the end of
the quarter and the increase in the dollar value of transactions that occur at
the end of a quarter can result in increased uncertainty relating to quarterly
revenues due to this endofperiod buying pattern forecasts may not be
achieved either because expected sales do not occur or because they occur at
lower prices or on terms that are less favorable to us in addition these
factors increase the chances that our results could diverge from the
expectations of investors and analysts

we face risks associated with our foreign operations a significant portion of
our net revenues manufacturing costs and operating expenses result from
transactions outside of the united states often in foreign currencies as a
result our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected
by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and general uncertainty with each
countrys political and economic structure

we must effectively adapt to changes in the dynamic technological environment
we are increasingly focused on the internet security market which in turn is
dependent on further acceptance and increased use of the internet the following
critical issues concerning the use of the internet remain unresolved and may
affect the market for our products and the use of the internet as a medium to
distribute or support our software products and the functionality of some of our
products

               security

               reliability

               cost

               ease of use

               accessibility

               quality of service and

               potential tax or other government regulations

in addition new technologies such as non pcbased internet access devices and
handheld organizers are gaining acceptance we must adapt to these changing
technological demands if we are unable to timely assimilate changes brought
about by the internet and non pcbased environments our future net revenues and
operating results could be adversely affected

the results of our research and development efforts are uncertain we believe
that we will need to incur significant research and development expenditures to
remain competitive the products we are currently developing or may develop in
the future may not be technologically successful in addition the length of our
product development cycle has generally been greater than we originally expected
and we are likely to experience delays in future product development if our
resulting products are not technologically successful they may not achieve
market acceptance or compete effectively with products of our competitors

we are dependent upon certain distribution channels a large portion of our
sales is made through the retail distribution channel which is subject to
events that cause unpredictability in consumer demand this increases the risk
that we may not plan effectively for the future which could result in adverse
operating results in future periods our retail distribution customers also
carry our competitors products these retail distributors may have limited
capital to invest in inventory their decisions to purchase our products are
partly a function of pricing terms and special promotions offered by our
competitors and other factors that we do not control and cannot predict our
agreements with retail distributors are generally nonexclusive and may be
terminated by them or by us without cause we would be adversely affected if
companies in our chain of distributors chose to increase purchases from our
competition relative to the amount they purchase from us

some distributors and resellers have experienced financial difficulties in the
past distributors that account for a significant portion of our sales may
experience financial difficulties in the future if these distributors do
experience



                                       26
page   29
financial difficulties and we are unable to move their inventories to
other distributors we may experience reduced sales or increased writeoffs
which would adversely affect our operating results

product returns may negatively affect our net revenues product returns can
occur when we introduce upgrades and new versions of products or when
distributors or retailers have excess inventories subject to various
contractual limitations our return policy allows distributors subject to these
contractual limitations to return purchased productsin exchange for new
products or for credit towards future purchases endusers may return our
products through dealers and distributors for a full refund within a reasonably
short period from the date of purchase we estimate and maintain reserves for
such product returns which to date have been materially consistent with our
actual experience future returns could however exceed the reserves we have
established which could have a material adverse effect on our operating
results

we depend on internal communications systems that may be disrupted our order
management and product shipping centers are geographically dispersed a business
disruption could occur as a result of natural disasters intermittent power
shortages in the state of california or the interruption in service by
communications carriers if our communications between these centers are
disrupted particularly at the end of a fiscal quarter we may suffer an
unexpected shortfall in net revenues and a resulting adverse impact on our
operating results communications and internet connectivity disruptions may also
cause delays in customer access to our internetbased services or product sales

we are exposed to general economic and market conditions and the current
economic downturn may adversely affect future revenue our business is subject
to the effects of general economic conditions and in particular market
conditions in the software and computer industries our operating results could
be adversely affected as a result of recent unfavorable global economic
conditions and reduced spending if these economic conditions do not improve or
if we experience a worsening in global economic conditions we may experience
material adverse impacts on our business operating results and financial
condition

we are subject to litigation that could adversely affect our financial results
from time to time we may be subject to claims that we have infringed the
intellectual property rights of others or other product liability claims or
other claims incidental to our business we are currently involved in a number
of lawsuits for a discussion of our current litigation see note 15 of notes to
consolidated financial statements of this form 10k we intend to defend all of
these lawsuits vigorously however it is possible that we could suffer an
unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases depending on the amount and
timing of any unfavorable resolutions of these lawsuits our future results of
operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in a particular
period

although infringement claims may ultimately prove to be without merit they are
expensive to defend and may consume our resources or divert our attention from
daytoday operations if a third party alleges that we have infringed their
intellectual property rights we may choose to litigate the claim andor seek an
appropriate license from the third party if we engage in litigation and the
third party is found to have a valid patent claim against us and a license is
not available on reasonable terms our business operating results and financial
condition may be materially adversely affected

the trend toward consolidation in the software industry could impede our ability
to compete effectively consolidation is underway among companies in the
software industry as firms seek to offer more extensive suites of software
products and broader arrays of software solutions changes resulting from this
consolidation may negatively impact our competitive condition in addition to
the extent that we seek to expand our product lines and skills and capacity
through acquisitions the trend toward consolidation may result in our
encountering competition and paying higher prices for acquired businesses

we must attract and retain personnel while competition for personnel in our
industry is intense competition in recruiting personnel in the software
industry is intense we believe that our future success will depend in part on
our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled management marketing and
technical personnel to accomplish this we believe that we must provide
personnel with a competitive compensation package including stock options
which require ongoing stockholder approval such approval may not be forthcoming
and as a result we may be impaired in our efforts to attract necessary
personnel

our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be adequately protected
from all unauthorized uses we regard our software and underlying technology as
proprietary we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of
confidentiality agreements and copyright patent trademark and trade secret
laws third parties may



                                       27
page   30
copy aspects of our products or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary
information without authorization or develop similar technology independently
all of our products are protected by copyright laws and we have a number of
patents and patent applications pending we may not achieve the desired
protection from and third parties may design around our patents in addition
existing copyright laws afford limited practical protection furthermore the
laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our
proprietary rights as the laws of the united states and we may be subject to
unauthorized use of our products any legal action that we may bring to protect
proprietary information could be expensive and may distract management from
daytoday operations

our products are complex and are operated in a wide variety of computer
configurations which could result in errors or product failures because we
offer very complex products undetected errors failures or bugs may occur when
they are first introduced or when new versions are released our products often
are installed and used in largescale computing environments with different
operating systems system management software and equipment and networking
configurations which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose
undetected errors failures or bugs in our products in the past we have
discovered software errors failures and bugs in certain of our product
offerings after their introduction and have experienced delays or lost revenues
during the period required to correct these errors our customers computer
environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and
nonstandard configurations that make prerelease testing for programming or
compatibility errors very difficult and timeconsuming despite testing by us
and by others errors failures or bugs may not be found in new products or
releases after commencement of commercial shipments errors failures or bugs in
products released by us could result in negative publicity product returns
loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products or claims by customers or
others alleviating such problems could require significant expenditures of our
capital and resources and could cause interruptions delays or cessation of our
product licensing which would adversely affect results of operations

most of our license agreements with customers contain provisions designed to
limit our exposure to potential product liability claims it is possible
however that these provisions may not prove effective in limiting our
liability

increased utilization and costs of our technical support services may adversely
affect our financial results like many companies in the software industry
technical support costs comprise a significant portion of our operating costs
and expenses over the short term we may be unable to respond to fluctuations
in customer demand for support services we also may be unable to modify the
format of our support services to compete with changes in support services
provided by competitors further customer demand for these services could cause
increases in the costs of providing such services and adversely affect our
operating results

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate
risk and we are not a party to any interest rate risk management transactions
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading
purposes

interest rate sensitivity

as of march 31 2001 the fair market value of our financial instruments with
exposure to interest risk was approximately us 317 million and euro 244
million sensitivity analysis for a sixmonth horizon was performed on our
floating rate and fixed rate financial investments and floating rate
liabilities parallel shifts in the yield curve of both 50 basis points would
result in changes in fair market values for these investments and floating rate
liabilities of less than 1 million for the euro investments parallel shifts
in the yield curve of both 50 basis points would result in changes in fair
market values for these investments of less than euro 1 million

exchange rate sensitivity

we conduct business in 36 international currencies through our worldwide
operations we have established a foreign currency hedging program utilizing
foreign currency forward exchange contracts or forward contracts of one fiscal
month duration to hedge various foreign currency transaction exposures under
this program increases or decreases in our foreign currency transactions are
offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts to mitigate the risk of
material foreign currency transaction losses we do not use forward contracts
for trading purposes at the end of each fiscal month all nonfunctional
currency assets and liabilities are revalued using the month end spot rate of
the maturing forward contracts and the realized gains and losses are recorded
and included in net income as a component of other income expense

we believe that the use of forward contracts should reduce the risks that arise
from conducting business in international markets we employ established
policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our
exposure to such risks however significant changes in exchange rates may still
result in adverse effects on our operating results

we use sensitivity analyses to quantify the impact that market risk exposures
may have on the fair market values of our financial instruments the financial
instruments included in the sensitivity analyses consist of all of our foreign
currency assets and liabilities and all derivative instruments principally
forward contracts the sensitivity analyses assesses the risk of loss in fair
market values from the impact of hypothetical changes of instantaneous parallel
shifts in exchange rates and interest rates yield curves on market sensitive
instruments over a sixmonth horizon

as of march 31 2001 the notional amount of our forward contracts was
approximately us 215 million a 10 movement in the levels of foreign
currency exchange rates would result in a decrease in our forward contracts by
approximately us 1 million and an increase in our forward contracts by
approximately us 1 million respectively this quantification of exposure to
the market risk associated with foreign financial instruments does not take into
account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair value of our foreign
denominated assets liabilities and firm commitments

as of march 31 2001 the fair value of our investments denominated in foreign
currencies was approximately us 212 million a 10 movement in the levels of
foreign currency exchange rates would result in an increase in the fair value of
our investments by approximately us 22 million and a decrease in the fair value
of our investments by approximately us 22 million respectively

revenue recognition

revenue is recognized under statement of position or sop 972 as modified by
sop 989 when the following conditions have been met

               persuasive evidence of an arrangement

               passage of title

               delivery has occurred or services have been rendered

               if applicable customer acceptance

               collection of a fixed or determinable license fee is considered
                reasonably assured and

               if appropriate reasonable estimates of future returns

revenue is derived primarily from sales of packaged products perpetual license
agreements product maintenance and professional services

packaged products are sold through a multitiered distribution channel we defer
revenue relating to all distribution and reseller channel inventory in excess of
certain inventory levels in these channels we offer the right of return of our
products under various policies we estimate and maintain reserves for product
returns and channel and enduser rebates and account for these reserves as an
offset to revenue for packaged products which generally include insignificant
postcontract support obligations generally telephone support the estimated
cost for providing postcontract support is accrued at the time of the sale

we enter into perpetual software license agreements through direct sales to
customers and indirect sales with distributors and resellers the license
agreements generally include product maintenance agreements which are deferred
and recognized ratably over the period of the agreements

our professional services include consulting implementation education and
managed security services consulting and implementation services revenue are
recognized as services are performed and upon written acceptance from customers
education services revenue is recognized as services are performed managed
security services revenue is recognized ratably over the period that such
contracted services are provided

in arrangements that include software licenses and maintenance andor
professional services multiple elements we allocate and defer revenue for
the undelivered items based on vendorspecific objective evidence of fair
value and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the
amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue if vendorspecific
objective evidence does not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance or
professional services then the entire arrangement fee is recognized over the
performance period

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 we adopted staff accounting bulletin
or sab no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements the adoption of
sab no 101 did not have a material effect on our consolidated statement of
financial position or results of operations and no restatement of prior quarters
was necessary

cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted investments

we consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with an original
maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents all of our cash equivalents
shortterm investments and restricted investments are classified as
availableforsale as of the balance sheet dates these securities are reported
at fair market value and any unrealized gains and losses net of applicable tax
effects are included as a component in stockholders equity as accumulated
other comprehensive income loss realized gains and losses on cash
equivalents shortterm investments and restricted investments are included in
interest income realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be
other than temporary on equity investments are included in other income
expense the cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification
method

derivative financial instruments

we utilize natural hedging to mitigate our foreign currency exposures and hedge
certain residual exposures through the use of onemonth foreign currency forward
exchange contracts we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts
with financial institutions primarily to minimize currency exchange risks
associated with certain balance sheet positions gains and losses on the
contracts are included in other income expense in the period that gains and
losses on the underlying transactions are recognized and generally offset the
fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts approximates cost due
to the short maturity periods

inventories

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market cost is principally
determined using currently adjusted standards which approximate actual cost on
a firstin firstout basis inventory consists of raw materials and finished
goods

equipment and leasehold improvements

equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost net of accumulated
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization is provided on a
straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets
generally the shorter of the lease term or three to seven years

acquired product rights

acquired product rights are comprised of purchased product rights technologies
and workforceinplace and capitalized software and are stated at cost less
accumulated amortization amortization is provided on a straightline basis over
the estimated useful lives of the respective assets generally three to five
years

goodwill

goodwill is recorded through acquisitions and is stated at cost less accumulated
amortization amortization is provided on a straightline basis over the
estimated useful lives of the respective goodwill generally four to five years

longlived assets

longlived assets including equipment leasehold improvements acquired product
rights and goodwill are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable an impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the
undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset
and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount such impairment
loss would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the
asset and its fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash
flows no impairments have been indicated to date

income taxes

income taxes are computed in accordance with statement of financial accounting
standards or sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes

stockbased compensation

we account for stockbased awards to employees using the intrinsic value method
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion or apb no 25
accounting for stock issued to employees and to nonemployees using the fair
value method in accordance with sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased
compensation in addition we apply applicable provisions of financial
accounting standards board or fasb interpretation or fin no 44 accounting
for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb
no 25

net income per share

basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the periods diluted net income per share is
computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and
potentially dilutive common shares during the periods diluted net income per
share also includes the assumed conversion of all of the outstanding convertible
subordinated debentures and assumed exercising of options if dilutive in the
period

concentrations of credit risk

our product revenues are concentrated in the software industry which is highly
competitive and rapidly changing significant technological changes in the
industry or customer requirements or the emergence of competitive products with
new capabilities or technologies could adversely affect operating results in
addition a significant portion of our revenues and net income is derived from
international sales and independent agents and distributors fluctuations of the
us dollar against foreign currencies changes in local regulatory or economic
conditions piracy or nonperformance by independent agents or distributors could
adversely affect operating results

financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit
risk consist principally of cash equivalents shortterm investments restricted
investments and trade accounts receivable our investment portfolio is
diversified and consists of investment grade securities we are exposed to
credit risks in the event of default by these institutions to the extent of the
amount recorded on the balance sheet the credit risk in our trade accounts

symantec corporation

receivable is substantially mitigated by our credit evaluation process
reasonably short collection terms and the geographical dispersion of sales
transactions we maintain reserves for potential credit losses and such losses
have been within managements expectations

legal expenses

we accrue estimated legal expenses for lawsuits only when both of the conditions
of sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies are met costs for external
attorney fees are accrued when the likelihood of the incurrence of the related
costs is probable and management has the ability to estimate such costs if both
of these conditions are not met management records the related legal expenses
when incurred amounts accrued by us are not discounted the material
assumptions used to estimate the amount of legal expenses include

               the monthly legal expense incurred by our external attorneys on
                the particular case being evaluated

               communication between us and our external attorneys on the
                expected duration of the lawsuit and the estimated expenses
                during that time

               our intentions regarding these lawsuits eg to defend
                vigorously to take to trial and the minimum amounts within the
                estimated range for which we would be willing to settle if
                settlement discussions were to occur

               deductible amounts under our insurance policies and

               past experiences with similar lawsuits

recent accounting pronouncements

on february 14 2001 the fasb issued a limited revision of its september 7
1999 exposure draft business combinations and intangible assets that proposes
to significantly change the accounting for goodwill acquired in a purchase
business combination under the revised proposal goodwill would not be
amortized but would be reviewed for impairment annually and if certain events
occur or circumstances exist goodwill impairment charges would be presented as
a separate line item within the operating section of the income statement the
nonamortization approach would apply to previously recorded goodwill as well as
goodwill arising from acquisitions completed after the application of the new
standard amortization of the remaining book value of goodwill would cease and
the new impairmentonly approach would apply the fasb expects to release the
final statement in july 2001 we will not adopt the provisions of the proposed
statement which defers reporting the effects of the proposed statement until
our first quarter of fiscal 2003

in june 1998 the fasb issued sfas no 133 accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for
hedging activities in june 1999 the fasb issued sfas no 137 accounting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities  deferral of the effective date
of fasb statement no 133 which defers the adoption of sfas no 133 for one
year sfas 133 will be effective for us at the beginning of the june 2001
quarter for both annual and interim reporting periods we do not expect the
adoption of this accounting pronouncement to have a material effect on our
consolidated financial position or results of operations

reclassifications

certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current presentation format with no impact on net income all financial
information has been restated to conform to this presentation

on december 18 2000 we acquired 100 of the outstanding common stock of axent
technologies inc or axent by issuing approximately 14528000 shares of our
common stock to axent shareholders based on a predetermined exchange ratio of
050 shares of symantec common stock for each share of axent common stock we
also assumed all of the outstanding axent employee stock options valued at
approximately 87 million we also accrued as part of the purchase price
approximately 18 million in acquisition related expenses which included
financial advisory legal and accounting duplicative site and fixed assets and
severance costs as of march 31 2001 the remaining accrual of approximately 3
million relates primarily to legal and accounting duplicative site and
severance costs the transaction was accounted for as a purchase the combined
total of the common stock issued options assumed and acquisition costs is
approximately 925 million based on the average of the closing prices of our
common stock on the agreement date of july 26 2000 and for the three days
before and after july 26 2000

with respect to stock options assumed as part of the acquisition all axent
employee stock options were exchanged for symantec stock options and are
included in the purchase price based on their fair value as of july 26 2000
any unvested axent options exchanged for unvested symantec options are also
included in the purchase price based on their fair value however the portion
of the intrinsic value of the unvested options that will be deemed to be earned
over the remaining vesting period of those options has been allocated to
deferred compensation and will be amortized over the remaining vesting period
the fair value of the options to be assumed has been based on the blackscholes
option pricing model using the following assumptions fair market value of the
underlying shares which is based on the average closing price of symantecs
common stock on july 26 2000 and for the three days before and after july 26
2000 the remaining contractual life of each option was used for the expected
life expected volatility of 065 no expected dividend rate and riskfree
interest rate of 65 the value of the deferred compensation of approximately
1 million was derived using the guidance of fin no 44

after certain adjustments made during the march 2001 quarter the aggregate
adjusted purchase price has been allocated as follows based on an independent
appraisal of the axent intangibles and inprocess research and development in
thousands

the consolidated financial statements reflect the preliminary allocations of the
purchase price for the axent acquisition the allocation has not been finalized
due to certain identified preacquisition contingencies accordingly in fiscal
2002 the allocation of purchase price and its components may change as these
contingencies are resolved

inprocess research and development had not reached technological feasibility
based on identifiable technological risk factors which indicate that even though
successful completion is expected it was not assured at the acquisition date
and accordingly has been charged to operations the amount allocated to
tradename workforceinplace and developed technology is being amortized over
the estimated useful lives of four years the purchase price in excess of
tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets has been allocated to
goodwill and will be amortized over its expected useful life of four years

the tangible assets of axent acquired in the merger principally include cash
marketable securities accounts receivable and fixed assets liabilities of
axent assumed in the merger principally include accounts payable and obligations
associated with providing ongoing maintenance and technical support contracts

notes to consolidated financial statements continued

because the royalties from interact are not guaranteed and the quarterly amounts
to be received were not determinable at december 31 1999 we have been and will
continue to recognize the royalties as earned we recognized income net of
expense from sale of technologies and product lines of approximately 193
million and 5 million from interact during fiscal 2001 and 2000 respectively
at the end of the fouryear period interact has the exclusive option for a
period of 30 days to purchase the licensed technology from us for 60 million
less all royalties paid to us to date as a result of the license we recognized
approximately 200 million from the shares received and wrote off or
transferred to interact 04 million of inventory and fixed assets attributed to
the act product line in addition we accrued approximately 13 million for
transaction related costs after recognizing these above amounts we recorded a
pretax gain of approximately 183 million in fiscal 2000 which was recorded
in income net of expenses from sale of technologies and product lines on the
consolidated statements of income during the march 2001 quarter interact
entered into a plan to merge with the sage group plc and we recorded a loss of
approximately 125 million as other expense related to the other than temporary
decline in value of our investment in interact see note 5 of notes to

over these activities we recorded approximately 08 million and 09 million
for these fees during fiscal 2001 and 2000 respectively in income net of
expenses from sale of technologies and product lines we do not anticipate any
future transition fees from webgain or interact

in march 1997 we sold our network administration technologies and related
tangible assets to the hewlettpackard company or hp we received royalty
payments from hp of approximately 7 million and 22 million during fiscal 1999
and 1998 respectively royalty payments from hp ended during the december 1998
quarter due to the uncertainty regarding the amounts upon which these royalties
would have been determined we recognized these amounts as they were received
from hp

related tangible assets to jetform corporation or jetform payable in
installments through the june 2000 quarter we received installment payments
from jetform of approximately 04 million 15 million and 34 million during
fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively due to the uncertainty regarding the
ultimate collectibility of these installments we recognized the related amounts
as payments were due and collectibility was assured from jetform

securities in another privately held company during the march 2001 quarter we
recorded a gain on the investment of approximately 1 million as other income
as a result of the privately held company being acquired by another entity

as of march 31 2001 and 2000 the estimated fair value of our restricted

treasury securities the restricted marketable securities have a contractual
maturity of less than one year our availableforsale restricted investments
relate to certain collateral requirements for lease agreements associated with
our corporate facilities in cupertino california fair values of the restricted
investments approximate cost due to the shortterm maturities of the investments

unrealized losses on all availableforsale securities are reported as a
component of stockholders equity net of tax effect of approximately 06
million and 24 million as of march 31 2001 and 2000 respectively

during the period covered by the consolidated financial statements we did not
use any derivative instrument for trading purposes we utilize some natural
hedging to mitigate our foreign currency exposures and we hedge certain residual
exposures through the use of onemonth foreign currency forward exchange
contracts or forward contracts we enter into forward contracts with financial
institutions primarily to protect against currency exchange risks associated
with certain balance sheet positions the fair value of forward contracts is
based on quoted market prices at march 31 2001 the notional amount of our
forward contracts was approximately 215 million all of which mature in 35 days
or less the fair value of forward contracts approximates cost due to the short
maturity periods we do not hedge our translation risk

realization of a significant portion of the 80 million of net deferred tax
assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future us taxable
income we believe that it is more likely than not that the asset will be
realized based on historical and forecasted us earnings the change in the
valuation allowance for fiscal 2001 and 2000 was a net increase of approximately
5 million and a net decrease of approximately 30 million respectively the
net increase in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2001 is attributable to a
writedown of an equity investment the loss of which may not be deductible for
tax purposes of the 30 million decrease in the valuation allowance during
fiscal 2000 approximately 21 million was attributable to previously
unbenefitted stock option deductions the benefit of which was credited to
stockholders equity

in connection with the acquisition of axent a 19 million net deferred tax
liability was established this amount represents a 35 million deferred tax
liability set up on certain acquired intangibles net of a 16 million deferred
tax asset set up for the tax carryforward attributes of axent the offsetting
adjustment was to increase goodwill see note 3 of notes to consolidated
financial statements

as of march 31 2001 we have tax credit carryforwards of approximately 6
million that expire in fiscal 2004 through 2006 in addition we have net
operating loss carryforwards attributable to quarterdeck of approximately 43
million that expire in fiscal 2011 through 2019 we also have net operating loss
carryforwards attributable to axent of approximately 24 million that expire in
fiscal 2007 through 2020 because of the change in ownership provisions of the
internal revenue code of 1986 the net operating loss carryforwards of
quarterdeck and axent are subject to an annual limitation of approximately 24
million and 10 million respectively regarding their utilization against
taxable income in future periods

pretax income from international operations was approximately 145 million 117
million and 64 million for fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively

no provision has been made for federal or state income taxes on 280 million of
cumulative unremitted earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries as of
march 31 2001 since we plan to indefinitely reinvest these earnings at march
31 2001 the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was
approximately 73 million

employee stock purchase plans

in october 1989 we established the 1989 employee stock purchase plan or 89
purchase plan since inception we have reserved a total of approximately 34
million shares of common stock for issuance under this plan subject to certain
limitations our employees may purchase through payroll deductions of 2 to 10
of compensation shares of common stock at a price per share that is the lesser
of 85 of the fair market value as of the beginning of the offering period or
the end of the purchase period as of march 31 2001 approximately 33 million
shares had been issued and no shares remain available under the 89 purchase
plan

on september 17 1998 our stockholders approved the 1998 employee stock
purchase plan or 98 purchase plan the 98 purchase plan was subsequently
amended by our stockholders on september 15 1999 to increase the limit on such
shares by 1 of our outstanding shares of common stock on each subsequent
january 1 during the term of the 98 purchase plan on january 1 2001 the
number of shares available for issuance automatically increased by approximately
800000 shares to 26 million shares as of march 31 2001 approximately
300000 shares had been issued and 23 million shares remain available under the
98 purchase plan

in december 2000 as a result of our acquisition of axent we assumed all
outstanding purchase rights under axents 1998 employee stock purchase plan or
axent purchase plan the axent purchase plan was amended such that each
thenoutstanding purchase right would be exercisable upon the same terms and
conditions as under the axent purchase plan immediately before the acquisition
each purchase right would be exercisable for symantec common stock equal to a
ratio of 05 of the number of shares of axent common stock for which such
purchase right would otherwise have been exercisable determined as of the
relevant grant date under the axent purchase plan at a purchase price per share
equal to 85 of the lower of i fair market value of a share of axent common
stock at the relevant grant date under the axent purchase plan divided by 05 or
ii the fair market value of a share of symantec common stock on the relevant
purchase date each purchase right granted under the axent plan shall terminate
if it has not previously terminated by its terms on the date that the holder
thereof enrolls in our 98 purchase plan

stock award plans

during fiscal 1996 we registered 400000 shares to be issued under the terms of
the 1994 patent incentive plan the purpose of this plan is to increase
awareness of the importance of patents to our business and to provide employees
with incentives to pursue patent protection for new technologies that may be
valuable to us our executive officers are not eligible for awards under the
1994 patent incentive plan as of march 31 2001 a total of approximately
28000 shares had been issued under this plan

this plan will be terminated as management is not currently using this plan to
issue common stock to employees

in september 2000 shareholders approved the 2000 directors equity incentive
plan and reserved 25000 shares for issuance under this plan the purpose of
this plan is to provide the members of the board of directors with an
opportunity to receive common stock for all or a portion of the retainer payable
to each director for serving as a member each director may elect to receive 50
to 100 of the retainer to be paid in the form of stock as of march 31 2001 a
total of approximately 4000 shares had been issued under this plan

future performance through awards of stock options and stock bonuses under the
terms of these plans the option exercise price may not be less than 100 of the

subject to the same terms and conditions as the original grant and generally
vest over four years and expires ten years from the date of grant each option
was adjusted at a ratio of 05 shares of symantec common stock for each one
share of axent common stock and the exercise price was adjusted by multiplying
the exercise price by 05

in january 2001 the board of directors approved the terms of the 2001
nonqualified equity incentive plan or 2001 nonqualified plan under which we
grant options to employees officers directors consultants independent
contractors and advisors to us or of any parent subsidiary or affiliate of

we elected to follow apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to
employees in accounting for our employee stock options because as discussed
below the alternative fair value accounting provided for under sfas no 123
accounting for stockbased compensation requires the use of option valuation
models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options under
apb no 25 because the exercise price of our employee stock options generally
equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant no
compensation expense is recognized in our financial statements

pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by
sfas no 123 this information is required to be determined as if we had
accounted for our employee stock options including shares issued under the
employee stock purchase plans collectively called options granted subsequent
to march 31 1995 under the fair value method of that statement the fair value
of options granted in fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 reported below has been
estimated at the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model
assuming no expected dividends and the following weighted average assumptions




                                                        employee stock options          employee stock purchase plans

the blackscholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable in addition option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility because
our options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimate in our opinion the existing models do not
necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our options

the weighted average estimated fair values of employee stock options granted
during fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 were 2540 2724 and 1256 per share
respectively the weighted average estimated fair value of employee stock
purchase rights granted under the employee stock purchase plans during fiscal
2001 2000 and 1999 were 2105 2005 and 1047 respectively

for purposes of pro forma disclosure the estimated fair value of the options is
amortized to expense over the options vesting period for employee stock
options and the sixmonth purchase period for stock purchases under the
employee stock purchase plans options assumed as the result of our acquisition
of axent were not included in the estimated fair value shares purchased through
the axent purchase plan subsequent to the closing date of the axent acquisition
were included in the estimated fair value and was included in the pro forma
information as follows

during the september 1998 quarter we made a decision to restructure our
operations and outsource domestic manufacturing operations as a result we
originally recorded a 38 million charge for personnel severance to reduce the
workforce by approximately 5 in both domestic and international operations and
a 13 million charge for the planned abandonment of a manufacturing facility
lease these estimates were subsequently revised in the september 1999 quarter
resulting in a reduction in the personnel severance and outplacement accruals by
approximately 07 million

the exit plans associated with each of the reductions in workforce and facility
closures above specifically identified all the significant actions including

               the names of individuals who would not continue employment with
                us

               the termination dates and severance packages for each
                terminating employee

               the planned date we would vacate the facilities which were under
                existing operating leases and

               the specific excess equipment furniture fixtures and leasehold
                improvements to be disposed of

employee severance and outplacement was primarily comprised of severance
packages for employees who were terminated as a result of the restructurings as
part of each restructuring plan we specifically identified those individuals
who would not continue employment with us the severance periods ranged from one
to six months the total cost of the severance packages was accrued and included
in a restructuring charge after the identified employees had their severance
packages communicated to them additionally we accrued estimated costs
associated with outplacement services to be provided to terminating employees
as these costs have no future economic benefit to us the remaining accrual at
march 31 2001 was for outstanding severance and outplacement costs

excess facilities and equipment included remaining lease payments associated
with building leases subsequent to their abandonment dates the cash outlays for
these leases are to be made over the remaining term of each lease in addition
we reserved for the writeoff of sitespecific equipment furniture fixtures
and leasehold improvements which would no longer be utilized the accrual at
march 31 2001 relates to the remaining lease payments which will be paid over
the remaining lease term subsequent to the abandonment of each facility

note 15 litigation

on december 23 1999 altiris inc filed a lawsuit in the united states district
court district of utah against us alleging that unspecified symantec products
including norton ghost enterprise edition infringed a patent owned by altiris
the lawsuit requests damages injunctive relief costs and attorney fees we
believe this claim has no merit and we intend to defend the action vigorously

on may 12 1999 a venture capital entity and a former stockholder owning less
than a majority share of cks limited which axent acquired in march 1999
commenced an action in the suffolk county superior court in boston
massachusetts against axent and its directors the action alleges violations of
the massachusetts uniform securities act negligent misrepresentations and
unfair trade practices we inherited this case upon its acquisition of

axent we believe the claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend
the action

in july 1998 the ontario court of justice general division ruled that we
should pay a total of approximately 68 million for damages and legal costs to
triolet systems inc and brian duncombe in a decadeold copyright action for
damages arising from the grant of a preliminary injunction against the
defendant the damages were awarded following the courts ruling that evidence
presented later in the case showed the injunction was not warranted we
inherited this case through our acquisition of delrina corporation which was
the plaintiff in this lawsuit we have appealed the decision however we
recorded a charge of approximately 58 million in the june 1998 quarter
representing the unaccrued portion of the judgment plus costs as of march 31
2001 we believe that we have adequately accrued for both the judgment and all
legal costs

on february 19 1998 a class action complaint was filed by the law firm of
milberg weiss bershad hynes  lerach in santa clara county superior court on
behalf of a class of purchasers of preversion 40 norton antivirus products a
similar complaint was filed in the same court on march 6 1998 by an oregon law
firm those actions were consolidated and a consolidated amended complaint was
filed in late october 1998 the complaint originally purported to assert claims
for breach of implied warranty fraud unfair business practices and violation
of californias consumer legal remedies act among others arising from the
alleged inability of earlier versions of norton antivirus to function properly
after the year 2000 all but the unfair business practice claims were dismissed
following our demurrer in december 2000 the unfair business practice claims
were dismissed and the case was resolved with no material financial impact on
the company

in october 1997 a complaint was filed in the united states district court for
the district of utah on behalf of powerquest corporation against quarterdeck
the complaint alleges that quarterdecks partitioning software included in
partitionit and partitionit extra strength violates a patent held by
powerquest in january 1998 powerquest obtained a second patent relating to
partitioning and has amended its complaint to allege infringement of that patent
as well the plaintiff seeks an injunction against distribution of partitionit
and partitionit extra strength and monetary damages we believe this claim has
no merit and we intend to defend the action vigorously

on september 15 1997 hilgraeve corporation or hilgraeve filed a lawsuit in
the united states district court eastern district of michigan against us
alleging that unspecified symantec products infringe a patent owned by
hilgraeve the lawsuit requested damages injunctive relief costs and attorney
fees in march 2000 the court granted our summary judgment motions and
dismissed the case the plaintiff has appealed the dismissal and we have
crossappealed a hearing on the appeals took place in may 2001 but no decision
has been issued

over the past few years it has become common for software companies including
us to receive claims of patent infringement we are currently evaluating claims
of patent infringement asserted by several parties with respect to certain of
our products while we believe that we have valid defenses to these claims the
outcome of any related litigation or negotiation could have a material adverse
impact on our future results of operations or cash flows

we are also involved in a number of other judicial and administrative
proceedings incidental to our business we intend to defend all of the
aforementioned pending lawsuits vigorously and although adverse decisions or
settlements may occur in one or more of the cases the final resolution of
these lawsuits individually or in the aggregate is not expected to have a
material adverse affect on our financial condition although it is not possible
to estimate the possible loss or losses from each of these cases depending
however on the amount and timing of an unfavorable resolution of these
lawsuits it is possible that our future results of operations or cash flows
could be materially adversely affected in a particular period we have accrued
certain estimated legal fees and expenses related to certain of these matters
however actual amounts may differ materially from those estimated amounts

the legal expenses accrued by us are deemed probable because the lawsuits have
been filed management has determined its plans of action with regards to the
cases and accordingly knows that it will incur legal expenses related to the
particular lawsuit utilizing the assumptions noted in the accounting policy
management is able to estimate a minimum amount of legal fees to be incurred in
these lawsuits

note 16 adoption of stockholder rights plan

on august 11 1998 the board adopted a stockholder rights plan designed to
ensure orderly consideration of any future unsolicited acquisition attempt to
ensure fair value of us for our stockholders

in connection with the plan the board declared a dividend of one preferred
share purchase right for each share of symantec common stock outstanding on the
record date august 21 1998 the board further directed the issuance of one
such right with respect to each share of symantec common stock that is issued
after the record date except in certain circumstances the rights will expire
on august 12 2008

the rights are initially attached to symantec common stock and will not trade
separately if a person or a group an acquiring person acquires 20 or more of
our common stock or announces an intention to make a tender offer for 20 or
more of our common stock the rights will be distributed and will thereafter
trade separately from the common stock each right will be exercisable for
11000th of a share of a newly designated series a junior participating
preferred stock at an exercise price of 15000 the preferred stock has been
structured so that the value of 11000th of a share of such preferred stock will
approximate the value of one share of common stock upon a person becoming an
acquiring person holders of the rights other than the acquiring person will
have the right to acquire shares of our common stock at a substantially
discounted price

if a person becomes an acquiring person and we are acquired in a merger or other
business combination or 50 or more of its assets are sold to an acquiring
person the holder of rights other than the acquiring person will have the
right to receive shares of common stock of the acquiring corporation at a
substantially discounted price after a person has become an acquiring person
the board at its option requires the exchange of outstanding rights other
than those held by the acquiring person for common stock at an exchange ratio
of one share of symantec common stock per right

the board may redeem outstanding rights at any time prior to a person becoming
an acquiring person at a price of 0001 per right prior to such time the
terms of the rights may be amended by the board in addition the board also
amended our bylaws to permit only the chairman president or the board to call
a special meeting of the stockholders require that the board be given prior
notice of a stockholder proposal to take action by written consent so that a
record date for such action can be established require advance notice to the
board of stockholdersponsored proposals for consideration at annual meetings
and for stockholder nominations for the election of directors permit the board
to meet on one rather than twoday advance notice and conform the bylaws to
applicable provisions of delaware law regarding the inspection of elections at
stockholder meetings
